<p class="First">Doxycycline is a broad-spectrum semisynthetic tetracycline.<span class="Sup">1</span> Doxycycline is bacteriostatic, inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis due to disruption of transfer RNA and messenger RNA at ribosomal sites.<span class="Sup">1</span><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> testing has shown that <span class="Italics">Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Campylobacter rectus, </span>and <span class="Italics">Fusobacterium nucleatum, </span>which are associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134398" conceptname="Periodontal disease">periodontal disease</span>, are susceptible to doxycycline at concentrations â‰¤ 6.0 <span class="Italics">Âµ</span>g/mL.<span class="Sup">2</span> A single-center, single-blind, randomized, clinical study in 45 subjects with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134398" conceptname="Periodontal disease">periodontal disease</span> demonstrated that a single treatment with ATRIDOX<span class="Sup">Â®</span> resulted in the reduction in the numbers of <span class="Italics">P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, C. rectus, F. nucleatum, Bacteroides forsythus, </span>and <span class="Italics">E. corrodens </span>in subgingival plaque samples. Levels of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were also reduced after treatment with ATRIDOX<span class="Sup">Â®</span>. The clinical significance of these findings, however, is not known. During these studies, no overgrowth of opportunistic organisms such as Gram-negative bacilli and yeast were observed. However, as with other antibiotic preparations, ATRIDOX<span class="Sup">Â®</span> therapy may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms including fungi. (See <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>)</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span></p>
<p>In a clinical pharmacokinetic study, subjects were randomized to receive either ATRIDOX<span class="Sup">Â® </span>covered with Coe-Pakâ„¢ periodontal dressing (n=13), ATRIDOX<span class="Sup">Â® </span>covered with Octyldentâ„¢ periodontal adhesive (n=13), or oral doxycycline (n=5) (according to package dosing instructions). The doxycycline release characteristics in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), saliva, and serum were evaluated.</p>
<p>Doxycycline levels in GCF peaked (~1,500 <span class="Italics">Âµ</span>g/mL and ~2000 <span class="Italics">Âµ</span>g/mL for Coe-Pakâ„¢ and Octyldentâ„¢ groups, respectively) 2 hours following treatment with ATRIDOX<span class="Sup">Â®</span>. These levels remained above 1000 Âµg/mL through 18 hours, at which time the levels began to decline gradually. However, local levels of doxycycline remained well above the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4190299" conceptname="Broth microdilution susceptibility test">minimum inhibitory concentration</span> (MIC<span class="Sub">90</span>) for periodontal pathogens (â‰¤ 6.0 <span class="Italics">Âµ</span>g/mL)<span class="Sup">2</span> through Day 7. In contrast, subjects receiving oral doxycycline had peak GCF levels of ~2.5<span class="Italics"> Âµ</span>g/mL at 12 hours following the initial oral dosing with levels declining to ~0.2 <span class="Italics">Âµ</span>g/mL by Day 7. High variability was observed for doxycycline levels in GCF for both oral and ATRIDOX<span class="Sup">Â®</span> treatment groups.</p>
<p>The ATRIDOX<span class="Sup">Â®</span> doxycycline release profile in GCF is illustrated in the figure below.</p>

<p>The maximum concentration of doxycycline in saliva was achieved at 2 hours after both treatments with ATRIDOX<span class="Sup">Â®</span>, with means of 4.05 <span class="Italics">Âµ</span>g/mL and 8.78 <span class="Italics">Âµ</span>g/mL and decreased to 0.36 <span class="Italics">Âµ</span>g/mL and 0.23 <span class="Italics">Âµ</span>g/mL at Day 7 for the Coe-Pakâ„¢ group and the Octyldentâ„¢ group, respectively.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">CLINICAL STUDIES
</span></h1>
<p class="First">In two well-controlled, multicenter, parallel-design, nine-month clinical trials, 831 patients (Study 1=411; Study 2=420) with chronic adult <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="141608" conceptname="Periodontitis">periodontitis</span> characterized by a mean probing depth of 5.9 to 6.0 mm were enrolled. Subjects received one of four treatments: 1) ATRIDOX<span class="Sup">Â®</span>, 2) Scaling and Root Planing, 3) Vehicle Control, or 4) Oral Hygiene. Treatment was administered to sites with probing depths 5 mm or greater that bled on probing. Subjects with detectable subgingival calculus on greater than 80% of all tooth surfaces were excluded from enrollment. All subjects received a second administration of the initially randomized treatment four months after their Baseline treatment. Changes in the efficacy parameters, attachment level, pocket depth, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> on probing, between Baseline and Month 9 showed that: 1) ATRIDOX<span class="Sup">Â®</span> was superior to Vehicle Control and Oral Hygiene, and 2) ATRIDOX<span class="Sup">Â®</span> met the decision rule of being at least 75% as good as Scaling and Root Planing (SRP) (the standard of at least 75% as good as SRP is required for any product approved as a stand alone therapy for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="141608" conceptname="Periodontitis">periodontitis</span>). Clinicians should note that the studies were of nine months duration. Additional research would be necessary to establish long term comparability to SRP. The results of Studies #1 and 2 for efficacy parameters of attachment level gain and probing depth reduction are included in the following graphs.</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="5c361496-figure-03" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=2c718fc7-2921-4d02-b273-784e513f8299&amp;name=5c361496-figure-03.jpg"></div>
<p>A third clinical trial was conducted to determine whether the product can be left in the pocket to bioabsorb or be expelled naturally andÂ  achieve comparable clinical results. In this study the product was retained with Octyldentâ„¢ dental adhesive rather than Coe-Pakâ„¢ periodontal dressing as in the previously mentioned studies. This was a 3-arm, randomized, controlled, parallel group, single blind trial that enrolled 605 subjects. The patient population studied and study design were comparable to that in Studies 1 and 2. Subjects receivedÂ  one of three treatments: 1) ATRIDOX<span class="Sup">Â®</span> with Coe-Pakâ„¢ removed afterÂ  7 days as in the pivotal trials, 2) ATRIDOX<span class="Sup">Â®</span> retained with Octyldentâ„¢ and left to bioabsorb or be expelled naturally or 3) Vehicle Control with Octyldentâ„¢ left to bioabsorb or be expelled naturally. Changes in the efficacy parameters, attachment level, pocket depth and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> on probing were equivalent to those observed in Studies 1 and 2. The results of the third study support the use of ATRIDOX<span class="Sup">Â®</span> retained with Octyldentâ„¢ and left to bioabsorb or be expelled naturally.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">WARNINGS
</span></h1>
<p class="First">THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD TO THE AGE OF EIGHT YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH. This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drugs, but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4131814" conceptname="Enamel hypoplasia">Enamel hypoplasia</span> has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED IN THIS AGE GROUP, OR IN PREGNANT WOMEN, UNLESS OTHER DRUGS ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE OR ARE CONTRAINDICATED. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has also been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">ATRIDOX</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">Â®</span></span><span class="Bold"> does not require local anesthesia for placement.</span> Bend the cannula to resemble a periodontal probe and explore the periodontal pocket in a manner similar to periodontal probing. Keeping the cannula tip near the base of the pocket, express the product into the pocket until the formulation reaches the top of the gingival margin. Withdraw the cannula tip from the pocket. In order to separate the tip from the formulation, turn the tip of the cannula towards the tooth, press the tip against the tooth surface, and pinch the string of formulation from the tip of the cannula. Variations on this technique may be needed to achieve separation between ATRIDOX<span class="Sup">Â®</span> and cannula.</p>
<p>If desired, using an appropriate dental instrument, ATRIDOX<span class="Sup">Â®</span> may be packed into the pocket. Dipping the edge of the instrument in water before packing will help keep ATRIDOX<span class="Sup">Â®</span> from sticking to the instrument, and will help speed coagulation of ATRIDOX<span class="Sup">Â®</span>. A few drops of water dripped onto the surface of ATRIDOX<span class="Sup">Â®</span> once in the pocket will also aid in coagulation. If necessary, add more ATRIDOX<span class="Sup">Â®</span> as described above and pack it into the pocket until the pocket is full.</p>
<p>Cover the pockets containing ATRIDOX<span class="Sup">Â®</span> with either Coe-Pakâ„¢ periodontal dressing or a cyanoacrylate dental adhesive.</p>
<p>Application of ATRIDOX<span class="Sup">Â®</span> may be repeated four months after initial treatment.</p>
