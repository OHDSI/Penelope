<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Doxepin Hydrochloride Oral Solution, USP is one of a class of psychotherapeutic agents known as dibenzoxepin tricyclic compounds.</p>
<p>It is a white crystalline solid readily soluble in water, lower alcohols and chloroform. The solution is administered orally and contains doxepin hydrochloride equivalent to 10 mg doxepin per mL.</p>
<p>Inactive Ingredients: citric acid anhydrous, glycerin, peppermint oil, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, purified water, sodium benzoate, sodium citrate dihydrate, and sorbitol solution.</p>
<p>Doxepin hydrochloride is a dibenzoxepin derivative and is the first of a family of tricyclic psychotherapeutic agents. Specifically, it is an isomeric mixture of: 1-Propanamine, 3-dibenz[<span class="Italics">b,e</span>]oxepin-11(6<span class="Italics">H</span>)ylidene-<span class="Italics">N,N</span>-dimethyl-,hydrochloride.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">The mechanism of action of doxepin hydrochloride is not definitely known. It is not a central nervous system stimulant nor a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. The current hypothesis is that the clinical effects are due, at least in part, to influences on the adrenergic activity at the synapses so that deactivation of norepinephrine by reuptake into the nerve terminals is prevented. Animal studies suggest that doxepin HCl does not appreciably antagonize the antihypertensive action of guanethidine. In animal studies anticholinergic, antiserotonin and antihistamine effects on smooth muscle have been demonstrated. At higher than usual clinical doses, norepinephrine response was potentiated in animals. This effect was not demonstrated in humans.</p>
<p>At clinical dosages up to 150 mg per day, doxepin hydrochloride can be given to man concomitantly with guanethidine and related compounds without blocking the antihypertensive effect. At dosages above 150 mg per day blocking of the antihypertensive effect of these compounds has been reported.</p>
<p>Doxepin hydrochloride is virtually devoid of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142453" conceptname="Feeling high">euphoria</span> as a side effect. Characteristic of this type of compound, doxepin hydrochloride has not been demonstrated to produce the physical tolerance or psychological <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> associated with addictive compounds.</p>

<h2>Clinical Worsening and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> Risk</h2>
<p class="First">Patients with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and/or the emergence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4092095" conceptname="Planning suicide">suicidal ideation</span> and behavior (suicidality), or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> is a known risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18–24) with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.</p>
<p>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440374" conceptname="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">obsessive compulsive disorder</span> (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.</p>

<p>									No <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>. 								</p>
<p>									It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.</span></p>

Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.</p>
<p>Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe,  abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.</p>

<h2>Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder</h2>
<p class="First">A major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive episode</span> may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic episode</span> in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4191716" conceptname="Symptoms of depression">depressive symptoms</span> should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>, bipolar disorder, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with doxepin hydrochloride and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about "Antidepressant Medicines, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> and other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions" is available for doxepin hydrochloride. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the <a href="#MG">Medication Guide</a> is reprinted at the end of this document.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking doxepin hydrochloride oral solution.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised that taking Doxepin Hydrochloride Oral Solution can cause mild pupillary dilation, which in susceptible individuals, can lead to an episode of angle-closure <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437541" conceptname="Glaucoma">glaucoma</span>. Pre-existing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437541" conceptname="Glaucoma">glaucoma</span> is almost always open-angle <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437541" conceptname="Glaucoma">glaucoma</span> because angle-closure <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437541" conceptname="Glaucoma">glaucoma</span>, when diagnosed, can be treated definitively with iridectomy.

<a name="section-7.4.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6</h3>
<p class="First">The biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase) is reduced in a subset of the Caucasian population (about 7–10% of Caucasians are so-called "poor metabolizers"); reliable estimates of the prevalence of reduced P450 2D6 isozyme activity among Asian, African and other populations are not yet available. Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) when given usual doses. Depending on the fraction of drug metabolized by P450 2D6, the increase in plasma concentration may be small, or quite large (8-fold increase in plasma AUC of the TCA).</p>
<p>In addition, certain drugs inhibit the activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers. An individual who is stable on a given dose of TCA may become abruptly toxic when given one of these inhibiting drugs as concomitant therapy. The drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 include some that are not metabolized by the enzyme (quinidine; cimetidine) and many that are substrates for P450 2D6 (many other antidepressants, phenothiazines, and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide). While all the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), e.g., citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine, inhibit P450 2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition. The extent to which SSRI-TCA interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the co-administration of TCAs with any of the SSRIs and also in switching from one class to the other. Of particular importance, sufficient time must elapse before initiating TCA treatment in a patient being withdrawn from fluoxetine, given the long half-life of the parent and active metabolite (at least 5 weeks may be necessary).</p>
<p>Concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the tricyclic antidepressant or the other drug. Furthermore, whenever one of these other drugs is withdrawn from co-therapy, an increased dose of tricyclic antidepressant may be required. It is desirable to monitor TCA plasma levels whenever a TCA is going to be co-administered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6.</p>
<p>Doxepin is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 (with CYP1A2 &amp; CYP3A4 as minor pathways). Inhibitors or substrates of CYP2D6 (i.e., quinidine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]) may increase the plasma concentration of doxepin when administered concomitantly. The extent of interaction depends on the variability of effect on CYP2D6. The clinical significance of this interaction with doxepin has not been systematically evaluated.</p>

<h3>MAO Inhibitors</h3>
<p class="First">Serious side effects and even <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> have been reported following the concomitant use of certain drugs with MAO inhibitors. Therefore, MAO inhibitors should be discontinued at least two weeks prior to the cautious initiation of therapy with doxepin hydrochloride. The exact length of time may vary and is dependent upon the particular MAO inhibitor being used, the length of time it has been administered, and the dosage involved.</p>

<h3>Cimetidine</h3>
<p class="First">Cimetidine has been reported to produce clinically significant fluctuations in steady-state serum concentrations of various tricyclic antidepressants. Serious anticholinergic symptoms (i.e., severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226991" conceptname="Aptyalism">dry mouth</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192450" conceptname="Retention of urine">urinary retention</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079185" conceptname="Hazy vision">blurred vision</span>) have been associated with elevations in the serum levels of tricyclic antidepressant when cimetidine therapy is initiated. Additionally, higher than expected tricyclic antidepressant levels have been observed when they are begun in patients already taking cimetidine. In patients who have been reported to be well controlled on tricyclic antidepressants receiving concurrent cimetidine therapy, discontinuation of cimetidine has been reported to decrease established steady-state serum tricyclic antidepressant levels and compromise their therapeutic effects.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">A determination has not been made whether controlled clinical studies of doxepin hydrochloride included sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to define a difference in response from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>
<p>The extent of renal excretion of doxepin hydrochloride has not been determined. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selections.</p>
<p>Sedating drugs may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> and oversedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of doxepin hydrochloride and observed closely.

<h2>General Recommendations</h2>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-9.2.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>General</h3>
<p class="First">Obtain an ECG and immediately initiate cardiac monitoring. Protect the patient's airway, establish an intravenous line and initiate gastric decontamination. A minimum of six hours of observation with cardiac monitoring and observation for signs of CNS or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac dysrhythmias</span> and/or conduction blocks, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> is strongly advised. If signs of toxicity occur at any time during this period, extended monitoring is recommended. There are case reports of patients succumbing to fatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">dysrhythmias</span> late after <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>; these patients had clinical evidence of significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">poisoning</span> prior to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> and most received  inadequate gastrointestinal decontamination. Monitoring of plasma drug levels should not guide management of the patient.</p>

<h3>Gastrointestinal Decontamination</h3>
<p class="First">All patients suspected of tricyclic antidepressant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> should receive gastrointestinal decontamination. This should include large volume gastric lavage followed by activated charcoal. If consciousness is impaired, the  airway should be secured prior to lavage. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">Emesis</span> is contraindicated.</p>

Intravenous sodium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span> should be used to maintain the serum pH in the range of 7.45 to 7.55. If the pH response is inadequate, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316814" conceptname="Hyperventilation">hyperventilation</span> may also be used. Concomitant use of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316814" conceptname="Hyperventilation">hyperventilation</span> and sodium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span> should be done with extreme caution, with frequent pH monitoring. A pH &gt;7.60 or a pCO<span class="Sub">2</span>&lt;20 mm Hg is undesirable. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">Dysrhythmias</span> unresponsive to sodium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span> therapy/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316814" conceptname="Hyperventilation">hyperventilation</span> may respond to lidocaine, bretylium or phenytoin. Type 1A and 1C antiarrhythmics are generally contraindicated (e.g., quinidine, disopyramide, and procainamide).</p>
<p>In rare instances, hemoperfusion may be beneficial in acute refractory cardiovascular instability in patients with acute toxicity. However, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, exchange transfusions, and forced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span> generally have been reported as ineffective in tricyclic antidepressant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">poisoning</span>.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">For most patients with illness of mild to moderate severity, a starting daily dose of 75 mg is recommended. Dosage may subsequently be increased or decreased at appropriate intervals and according to individual response. The usual optimum dose range is 75 mg/day to 150 mg/day.</p>
<p>In more severely ill patients higher doses may be required with subsequent gradual increase to 300 mg/day if necessary. Additional therapeutic effect is rarely to be obtained by exceeding a dose of 300 mg/day.</p>
