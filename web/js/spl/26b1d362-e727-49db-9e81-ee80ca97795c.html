<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Clonazepam Orally Disintegrating Tablets USP, a benzodiazepine, is available as an orally disintegrating tablet containing 0.125 mg, 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg or 2 mg clonazepam. Each orally disintegrating tablet contains aspartame, crospovidone, magnesium stearate, mannitol, silicon dioxide, sorbitol, sodium lauryl sulfate, and talc.</p>
<p>Chemically, clonazepam is 5-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-7-nitro-2<span class="Italics">H</span>-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one. It is a light yellow crystalline powder. It has a molecular weight of 315.72 and the following structural formula:</p>

<p class="First">The precise mechanism by which clonazepam exerts its anti-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> and anti-panic effects is unknown, although it is believed to be related to its ability to enhance the activity of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">Convulsions</span> produced in rodents by pentylenetetrazol or, to a lesser extent, electrical stimulation are antagonized, as are <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> produced by photic stimulation in susceptible baboons.

<h2><span class="Italics">Pharmacokinetics:</span></h2>
<p class="First">Clonazepam is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration. The absolute bioavailability of clonazepam is about 90%. Maximum plasma concentrations of clonazepam are reached within 1 to 4 hours after oral administration. Clonazepam is approximately 85% bound to plasma proteins. Clonazepam is highly metabolized, with less than 2% unchanged clonazepam being excreted in the urine. Biotransformation occurs mainly by reduction of the 7-nitro group to the 4-amino derivative. This derivative can be acetylated, hydroxylated and glucuronidated. Cytochrome P-450 including CYP3A, may play an important role in clonazepam reduction and oxidation. The elimination half-life of clonazepam is typically 30 to 40 hours. Clonazepam pharmacokinetics are dose-independent throughout the dosing range. There is no evidence that clonazepam induces its own metabolism or that of other drugs in humans.</p>

<h3><span class="Italics">Pharmacokinetics in Demographic Subpopulations and in Disease States:</span></h3>
<p class="First">Controlled studies examining the influence of gender and age on clonazepam pharmacokinetics have not been conducted, nor have the effects of renal or liver disease on clonazepam pharmacokinetics been studied. Because clonazepam undergoes hepatic metabolism, it is possible that liver disease will impair clonazepam elimination. Thus, caution should be exercised when administering clonazepam to these patients.</p>

<h3><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">Panic Disorder</span>:</span></h3>
<p class="First">The effectiveness of clonazepam in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> was demonstrated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of adult outpatients who had a primary diagnosis of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> (DSM-IIIR) with or without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4321835" conceptname="Agoraphobia">agoraphobia</span>. In these studies, clonazepam was shown to be significantly more effective than placebo in treating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> on change from baseline in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021498" conceptname="Panic attack">panic attack</span> frequency, the Clinician’s Global Impression Severity of Illness Score and the Clinician’s Global Impression Improvement Score.</p>
<p>Study 1 was a 9-week, fixed-dose study involving clonazepam doses of 0.5, 1, 2, 3 or 4 mg/day or placebo. This study was conducted in four phases: a 1-week placebo lead-in, a 3-week upward titration, a 6-week fixed dose and a 7-week discontinuance phase. A significant difference from placebo was observed consistently only for the 1 mg/day group. The difference between the 1 mg dose group and placebo in reduction from baseline in the number of full <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021498" conceptname="Panic attack">panic attacks</span> was approximately 1 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021498" conceptname="Panic attack">panic attack</span> per week. At endpoint, 74% of patients receiving clonazepam 1 mg/day were free of full <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021498" conceptname="Panic attack">panic attacks</span>, compared to 56% of placebo-treated patients.</p>
<p>Study 2 was a 6-week, flexible-dose study involving clonazepam in a dose range of 0.5 to 4 mg/day or placebo. This study was conducted in three phases: a 1-week placebo lead-in, a 6-week optimal-dose and a 6-week discontinuance phase. The mean clonazepam dose during the optimal dosing period was 2.3 mg/day. The difference between clonazepam and placebo in reduction from baseline in the number of full <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021498" conceptname="Panic attack">panic attacks</span> was approximately 1 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021498" conceptname="Panic attack">panic attack</span> per week. At endpoint, 62% of patients receiving clonazepam were free of full <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021498" conceptname="Panic attack">panic attacks</span>, compared to 37% of placebo-treated patients.</p>
<p>Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of race or gender.</p>

<h2><span class="Italics">Interference With Cognitive and Motor Performance:</span></h2>
<p class="First">Since clonazepam produces <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span>, patients receiving this drug should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring mental alertness, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. They should also be warned about the concomitant use of alcohol or other CNS-depressant drugs during clonazepam therapy (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS:</span><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions and Information for Patients</span>).</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322252" conceptname="Suicidal behavior">Suicidal Behavior</span> and Ideation</span><span class="Bold">: </span>Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) including clonazepam, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or unusual changes in mood or behavior.</p>
<p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono-and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322252" conceptname="Suicidal behavior">suicidal behavior</span> or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43% compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>.</p>
<p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</p>
<p>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Table 1</span> shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</p>

<h2><span class="Italics">General Concerns and Considerations About Anticonvulsants:</span></h2>
<p class="First">Recent reports suggest an association between the use of anticonvulsant drugs by women with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> and an elevated incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span> in children born to these women. Data are more extensive with respect to diphenylhydantoin and phenobarbital, but these are also the most commonly prescribed anticonvulsants; less systematic or anecdotal reports suggest a possible similar association with the use of all known anticonvulsant drugs.</p>
<p>In children of women treated with drugs for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>, reports suggesting an elevated incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span> cannot be regarded as adequate to prove a definite cause and effect relationship. There are intrinsic methodologic problems in obtaining adequate data on drug <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> in humans; the possibility also exists that other factors (e.g., genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself) may be more important than drug therapy in leading to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span>. The great majority of mothers on anticonvulsant medication deliver normal infants. It is important to note that anticonvulsant drugs should not be discontinued in patients in whom the drug is administered to prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> because of the strong possibility of precipitating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span> with attendant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxia</span> and threat to life. In individual cases where the severity and frequency of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> disorder are such that the removal of medication does not pose a serious threat to the patient, discontinuation of the drug may be considered prior to and during pregnancy; however, it cannot be said with any confidence that even mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> do not pose some hazards to the developing embryo or fetus.</p>

<h2><span class="Italics">General Concerns About Benzodiazepines:</span></h2>
<p class="First">An increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of benzodiazepine drugs has been suggested in several studies.</p>
<p>There may also be non-teratogenic risks associated with the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy. There have been reports of neonatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">flaccidity</span>, respiratory and feeding difficulties, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435371" conceptname="Hypothermia">hypothermia</span> in children born to mothers who have been receiving benzodiazepines late in pregnancy. In addition, children born to mothers receiving benzodiazepines late in pregnancy may be at some risk of experiencing withdrawal symptoms during the postnatal period.</p>

<h2><span class="Italics">Advice Regarding the Use of Clonazepam in Women of Childbearing Potential:</span></h2>
<p class="First">In general, the use of clonazepam in women of childbearing potential, and more specifically during known pregnancy, should be considered only when the clinical situation warrants the risk to the fetus.</p>
<p>The specific considerations addressed above regarding the use of anticonvulsants for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> in women of childbearing potential should be weighed in treating or counseling these women.</p>
<p>Because of experience with other members of the benzodiazepine class, clonazepam is assumed to be capable of causing an increased risk of congenital abnormalities when administered to a pregnant woman during the first trimester. Because use of these drugs is rarely a matter of urgency in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span>, their use during the first trimester should almost always be avoided. The possibility that a woman of childbearing potential may be pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Patients should also be advised that if they become pregnant during therapy or intend to become pregnant, they should communicate with their physician about the desirability of discontinuing the drug.</p>

<h2><span class="Italics">Information for Patients:</span></h2>
<p class="First">A clonazepam Medication Guide must be given to the patient each time clonazepam is dispensed, as required by law.

<h3><span class="Italics">Effect of Clonazepam on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs:</span></h3>

<h3><span class="Italics">Effect of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Clonazepam:</span></h3>
<p class="First">Literature reports suggest that ranitidine, an agent that decreases stomach acidity, does not greatly alter clonazepam pharmacokinetics.</p>
<p>In a study in which the 2 mg clonazepam orally disintegrating tablet was administered with and without propantheline (an anticholinergic agent with multiple effects on the GI tract) to healthy volunteers, the AUC of clonazepam was 10% lower and the C<span class="Sub">max</span> of clonazepam was 20% lower when the orally disintegrating tablet was given with propantheline compared to when it was given alone.</p>
<p>Fluoxetine does not affect the pharmacokinetics of clonazepam. Cytochrome P-450 inducers, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital, induce clonazepam metabolism, causing an approximately 30% decrease in plasma clonazepam levels. Although clinical studies have not been performed, based on the involvement of the cytochrome P-450 3A family in clonazepam metabolism, inhibitors of this enzyme system, notably oral antifungal agents, should be used cautiously in patients receiving clonazepam.</p>

<h2><span class="Italics">Geriatric Use:</span></h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of clonazepam did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>
<p>Because clonazepam undergoes hepatic metabolism, it is possible that liver disease will impair clonazepam elimination. Metabolites of clonazepam are excreted by the kidneys; to avoid their excess accumulation, caution should be exercised in the administration of the drug to patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic and/or renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to assess hepatic and/or renal function at the time of dose selection.</p>

<p class="First">Adverse events during exposure to clonazepam were obtained by spontaneous report and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tables and tabulations that follow, CIGY dictionary terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events, except in certain cases in which redundant terms were collapsed into more meaningful terms, as noted below.</p>
<p>The stated frequencies of adverse events represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse event of the type listed. An event was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation.</p>

<p class="First">Overall, the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse events was 17% in clonazepam compared to 9% for placebo in the combined data of two 6- to 9-week trials. The most common events (≥1%) associated with discontinuation and a dropout rate twice or greater for clonazepam than that of placebo included the following:</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Table 3</span> enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred during acute therapy of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> from a pool of two 6- to 9-week trials. Events reported in 1% or more of patients treated with clonazepam (doses ranging from 0.5 to 4 mg/day) and for which the incidence was greater than that in placebo-treated patients are included.</p>
<p>The prescriber should be aware that the figures in <span class="Bold">Table 3</span> cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side effect incidence in the population studied.</p>

<h3><span class="Italics">Treatment-Emergent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4191716" conceptname="Symptoms of depression">Depressive Symptoms</span>:</span></h3>
<p class="First">In the pool of two short-term placebo-controlled trials, adverse events classified under the preferred term “depression? were reported in 7% of clonazepam-treated patients compared to 1% of placebo-treated patients, without any clear pattern of dose relatedness. In these same trials, adverse events classified under the preferred term “depression? were reported as leading to discontinuation in 4% of clonazepam-treated patients compared to 1% of placebo-treated patients. While these findings are noteworthy, Hamilton <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> Rating Scale (HAM-D) data collected in these trials revealed a larger decline in HAM-D scores in the clonazepam group than the placebo group suggesting that clonazepam-treated patients were not experiencing a worsening or emergence of clinical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="Italics">Other Adverse Events Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Clonazepam in Panic:</span></h3>
<p class="First">Following is a list of modified CIGY terms that reflect treatment-emergent adverse events reported by patients treated with clonazepam at multiple doses during clinical trials. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 3 or elsewhere in labeling, those events for which a drug cause was remote, those event terms which were so general as to be uninformative, and events reported only once and which did not have a substantial probability of being acutely life-threatening. It is important to emphasize that, although the events occurred during treatment with clonazepam, they were not necessarily caused by it.</p>
<p>Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency. These adverse events were reported infrequently, which is defined as occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients.</p>

The more severe withdrawal symptoms have usually been limited to those patients who received excessive doses over an extended period of time. Generally milder withdrawal symptoms (eg, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4148767" conceptname="Dysphoric mood">dysphoria</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>) have been reported following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines taken continuously at therapeutic levels for several months. Consequently, after extended therapy, abrupt discontinuation should generally be avoided and a gradual dosage tapering schedule followed (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>). Addiction-prone individuals (such as drug addicts or alcoholics) should be under careful surveillance when receiving clonazepam or other psychotropic agents because of the predisposition of such patients to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4036424" conceptname="Drug tolerance">habituation</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>.</p>

Overall, the discontinuance period was associated with good tolerability and a very modest clinical deterioration, without evidence of a significant rebound phenomenon. However, there are not sufficient data from adequate and well-controlled long-term clonazepam studies in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> to accurately estimate the risks of withdrawal symptoms and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> that may be associated with such use.</p>

<h3><span class="Italics">Adults:</span></h3>
<p class="First">The initial dose for adults with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> is 0.25 mg bid. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days. The recommended dose of 1 mg/day is based on the results from a fixed dose study in which the optimal effect was seen at 1 mg/day. Higher doses of 2, 3 and 4 mg/day in that study were less effective than the 1 mg/day dose and were associated with more adverse effects. Nevertheless, it is possible that some individual patients may benefit from doses of up to a maximum dose of 4 mg/day, and in those instances, the dose may be increased in increments of 0.125 to 0.25 mg bid every 3 days until <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> is controlled or until side effects make further increases undesired. To reduce the inconvenience of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, administration of one dose at bedtime may be desirable.</p>
<p>Treatment should be discontinued gradually, with a decrease of 0.125 mg bid every 3 days, until the drug is completely withdrawn.</p>
<p>There is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with clonazepam should remain on it. Therefore, the physician who elects to use clonazepam for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.</p>
