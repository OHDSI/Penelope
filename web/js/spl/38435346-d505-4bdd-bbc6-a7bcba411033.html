<h1><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY </span></h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pharmacodynamics:</span></p>
<p>Ondansetron is a selective 5-HT<span class="Sub">3</span> receptor antagonist. While its mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, ondansetron is not a dopamine-receptor antagonist. Serotonin receptors of the 5-HT<span class="Sub">3</span> type are present both peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is not certain whether ondansetron’s antiemetic action is mediated centrally, peripherally, or in both sites. However, cytotoxic chemotherapy appears to be associated with release of serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine. In humans, urinary 5-HIAA (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid) excretion increases after cisplatin administration in parallel with the onset of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span>. The released serotonin may stimulate the vagal afferents through the 5-HT<span class="Sub">3</span> receptors and initiate the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> reflex.</p>
<p>In animals, the emetic response to cisplatin can be prevented by pretreatment with an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis, bilateral abdominal vagotomy and greater splanchnic nerve section, or pretreatment with a serotonin 5-HT<span class="Sub">3</span> receptor antagonist.</p>
<p>In normal volunteers, single intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron had no effect on esophageal motility, gastric motility, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, or small intestinal transit time. Multiday administration of ondansetron has been shown to slow colonic transit in normal volunteers. Ondansetron has no effect on plasma prolactin concentrations.</p>
<p>Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">neuromuscular blockade</span> produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics:</span></h2>
<p class="First">Ondansetron is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and undergoes some first-pass metabolism. Mean bioavailability in healthy subjects, following administration of a single 8 mg tablet, is approximately 56%.</p>
<p>Ondansetron systemic exposure does not increase proportionately to dose. AUC from a 16 mg tablet was 24% greater than predicted from an 8 mg tablet dose. This may reflect some reduction of first-pass metabolism at higher oral doses. Bioavailability is also slightly enhanced by the presence of food but unaffected by antacids.</p>
<p>Ondansetron is extensively metabolized in humans, with approximately 5% of a radiolabeled dose recovered as the parent compound from the urine. The primary metabolic pathway is hydroxylation on the indole ring followed by subsequent glucuronide or sulfate conjugation. Although some nonconjugated metabolites have pharmacologic activity, these are not found in plasma at concentrations likely to significantly contribute to the biological activity of ondansetron.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> metabolism studies have shown that ondansetron is a substrate for human hepatic cytochrome P-450 enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. In terms of overall ondansetron turnover, CYP3A4 played the predominant role. Because of the multiplicity of metabolic enzymes capable of metabolizing ondansetron, it is likely that inhibition or loss of one enzyme (e.g., CYP2D6 genetic deficiency) will be compensated by others and may result in little change in overall rates of ondansetron elimination. Ondansetron elimination may be affected by cytochrome P-450 inducers. In a pharmacokinetic study of 16 epileptic patients maintained chronically on CYP3A4 inducers, carbamazepine, or phenytoin, reduction in AUC, C<span class="Sub">max</span> and T<span class="Sub">½ </span>of ondansetron was observed.<span class="Sup">1</span> This resulted in a significant increase in clearance. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_bd6811c9-e10a-41c8-82cd-96045a80624a">PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions</a></span>).</p>
<p>In humans, carmustine, etoposide and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron.</p>
<p>Gender differences were shown in the disposition of ondansetron given as a single dose. The extent and rate of ondansetron"s absorption is greater in women than men. Slower clearance in women, a smaller apparent volume of distribution (adjusted for weight), and higher absolute bioavailability resulted in higher plasma ondansetron levels. These higher plasma levels may in part be explained by differences in body weight between men and women. It is not known whether these gender-related differences were clinically important. More detailed pharmacokinetic information is contained in Tables 1 and 2 taken from 2 studies.</p>

<p>A reduction in clearance and increase in elimination half-life are seen in patients over 75 years of age. In clinical trials with cancer patients, safety and efficacy were similar in patients over 65 years of age and those under 65 years of age; there was an insufficient number of patients over 75 years of age to permit conclusions in that age-group. No dosage adjustment is recommended in the elderly.</p>
<p>In patients with mild-to-moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>, clearance is reduced 2-fold and mean half-life is increased to 11.6 hours compared to 5.7 hours in normals. In patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> (Child-Pugh<span class="Sup">2 </span>score of 10 or greater), clearance is reduced 2-fold to 3-fold and apparent volume of distribution is increased with a resultant increase in half-life to 20 hours. In patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>, a total daily dose of 8 mg should not be exceeded.</p>
<p>Due to the very small contribution (5%) of renal clearance to the overall clearance, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> was not expected to significantly influence the total clearance of ondansetron. However, ondansetron oral mean plasma clearance was reduced by about 50% in patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min). This reduction in clearance is variable and was not consistent with an increase in half-life. No reduction in dose or dosing frequency in these patients is warranted.</p>
<p>Plasma protein binding of ondansetron as measured <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> was 70% to 76% over the concentration range of 10 to 500 ng/mL. Circulating drug also distributes into erythrocytes.</p>
<p>Four and 8 mg doses of ondansetron oral solution, USP is bioequivalent to corresponding doses of ondansetron tablets and may be used interchangeably.</p>

This was followed by the administration of ondansetron tablets ranging from 4 to 24 mg daily for 3 days. In these studies, 58% of the 170 evaluable patients had a complete response (no emetic episodes) on day 1. Two studies showed the response rates for patients less than 12 years of age who received ondansetron tablets 4 mg 3 times a day to be similar to those in patients 12 to 18 years of age who received ondansetron tablets 8 mg 3 times daily.

<h1><span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS </span></h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">General</span>: Ondansetron is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction. The use of ondansetron in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> may mask a progressive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="193518" conceptname="Intestinal obstruction">ileus</span> and/or gastric distension.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions:</span></h2>
<p class="First">Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_dac463e1-0374-48cc-8bc2-c1c92be81cd0">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics</a></span>). Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. On the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Apomorphine:</span></span> Based on reports of profound <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372448" conceptname="Loss of consciousness">loss of consciousness</span> when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_914de7bc-6283-4c1a-9475-63ed7dbc61a4">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span>).</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Phenytoin, Carbamazepine and Rifampicin:</span></span> In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs.<span class="Sup">1,3 </span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"> </span></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Serotonergic Drugs:</span></span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">Serotonin syndrome</span> (including altered mental status, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434633" conceptname="Disorder of autonomic nervous system">autonomic instability</span>, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT<span class="Sub">3</span> receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"> </span></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Tramadol:</span></span> Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.<span class="Sup">4,5</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Chemotherapy:</span></span> Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P-388 mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315497" conceptname="Subacute leukemia">leukemia</span> model is not affected by ondansetron. In humans, carmustine, etoposide and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron.</p>
<p>In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, I.V. ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Use in Surgical Patients:</span> The co-administration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:</span> Carcinogenic effects were not seen in 2-year studies in rats and mice with oral ondansetron doses up to 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, respectively. Ondansetron was not mutagenic in standard tests for mutagenicity. Oral administration of ondansetron up to 15 mg/kg/day did not affect fertility or general reproductive performance of male and female rats.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy: </span><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Teratogenic Effects:</span></span> Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies have been performed in pregnant rats and rabbits at daily oral doses up to 15 and 30 mg/kg/day, respectively, and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to ondansetron. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers:</span> Ondansetron is excreted in the breast milk of rats. It is not known whether ondansetron is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when ondansetron is administered to a nursing woman.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use:</span> Little information is available about dosage in pediatric patients 4 years of age or younger (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_f1aba10c-62ca-4503-a137-2ed7b2669ef3">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_e353e2ca-3b60-4e72-8172-c74dae1921c6">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span> sections for use in pediatric patients 4 to 18 years of age).</p>
