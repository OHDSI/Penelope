<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">Ketorolac tromethamine is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that exhibits analgesic activity in animal models. The mechanism of action of ketorolac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but may be related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition. The biological activity of ketorolac tromethamine is associated with the S-form. Ketorolac tromethamine possesses no sedative or anxiolytic properties.</p>
<p>The peak <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span> of ketorolac tromethamine occurs within 2 to 3 hours and is not statistically significantly different over the recommended dosage range of ketorolac tromethamine. The greatest difference between large and small doses of ketorolac tromethamine is in the duration of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Ketorolac tromethamine is a racemic mixture of [-]S- and [+]R-enantiomeric forms, with the S-form having analgesic activity.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Comparison of IV, IM and Oral Pharmacokinetics</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of ketorolac tromethamine, following IV, IM and oral doses of ketorolac tromethamine tablets, are compared in Table 1. In adults, the extent of bioavailability following administration of the oral and IM forms of ketorolac tromethamine was equal to that following an IV bolus.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Linear Kinetics</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">In adults, following administration of single oral, IM or IV doses of ketorolac tromethamine in the recommended dosage ranges, the clearance of the racemate does not change. This implies that the pharmacokinetics of ketorolac tromethamine in adults, following single or multiple IM, IV or recommended oral doses of ketorolac tromethamine, are linear. At the higher recommended doses, there is a proportional increase in the concentrations of free and bound racemate.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">Ketorolac tromethamine is 100% absorbed after oral administration (see Table 1). Oral administration of ketorolac tromethamine after a high-fat meal resulted in decreased peak and delayed time-to-peak concentrations of ketorolac tromethamine by about one hour. Antacids did not affect the extent of absorption.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">The mean apparent volume (V<span class="Sub">β</span>) of ketorolac tromethamine following complete distribution was approximately 13 liters. This parameter was determined from single-dose data. The ketorolac tromethamine racemate has been shown to be highly protein bound (99%). Nevertheless, plasma concentrations as high as 10 mcg/mL will only occupy approximately 5% of the albumin binding sites. Thus, the unbound fraction for each enantiomer will be constant over the therapeutic range. A decrease in serum albumin, however, will result in increased free drug concentrations.</p>
<p>Ketorolac tromethamine is excreted in human milk (see <a href="#_Ref">PRECAUTIONS: Nursing Mothers</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">Ketorolac tromethamine is largely metabolized in the liver. The metabolic products are hydroxylated and conjugated forms of the parent drug. The products of metabolism, and some unchanged drug, are excreted in the urine.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="i4i_section_id_e6699663-7ce8-499d-bd85-5d7ca05a2880"></a><a name="section-2.2.6"></a><p></p>
<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">The principal route of elimination of ketorolac and its metabolites is renal. About 92% of a given dose is found in the urine, approximately 40% as metabolites and 60% as unchanged ketorolac. Approximately 6% of a dose is excreted in the feces. A single-dose study with 10 mg ketorolac tromethamine (n = 9) demonstrated that the S-enantiomer is cleared approximately 2 times faster than the R-enantiomer and that the clearance was independent of the route of administration. This means that the ratio of S/R plasma concentrations decreases with time after each dose. There is little or no inversion of the R- to S- form in humans. The clearance of the racemate in normal subjects, elderly individuals and in hepatically and renally impaired patients is outlined in Table 2 (see <a href="#i4i_section_id_96c2b21d-d6e0-4ece-a638-dd55f9810baa">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Kinetics in Special Populations</a>).</p>
<p>The half-life of the ketorolac tromethamine S-enantiomer was approximately 2.5 hours (SD ± 0.4) compared with 5 hours (SD ± 1.7) for the R-enantiomer. In other studies, the half-life for the racemate has been reported to lie within the range of 5 to 6 hours.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Accumulation</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">Ketorolac tromethamine administered as an IV bolus every 6 hours for 5 days to healthy subjects (n = 13), showed no significant difference in C<span class="Sub">max</span> on Day 1 and Day 5. Trough levels averaged 0.29 mcg/mL (SD ± 0.13) on Day 1 and 0.55 mcg/mL (SD ± 0.23) on Day 6. Steady-state was approached after the fourth dose.</p>
<p>Accumulation of ketorolac tromethamine has not been studied in special populations (geriatric, pediatric, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span> patients).</p>

<h4>Geriatric Patients</h4>
<p class="First">Based on single-dose data only, the half-life of the ketorolac tromethamine racemate increased from 5 to 7 hours in the elderly (65 to 78 years) compared with young healthy volunteers (24 to 35 years) (see Table 2). There was little difference in the C<span class="Sub">max</span> for the two groups (elderly, 2.52 mcg/mL ± 0.77; young, 2.99 mcg/mL ± 1.03) (see <a href="#_Ref">PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use</a>).</p>

<h4>Pediatric Patients</h4>
<p class="First">Limited information is available regarding the pharmacokinetics of dosing of ketorolac tromethamine in the pediatric population. Following a single intravenous bolus dose of 0.5 mg/kg in 10 children 4 to 8 years old, the half-life was 5.8 ± 1.6 hours, the average clearance was 0.042 ± 0.01 L/hr/kg, the volume of distribution during the terminal phase (V<span class="Sub">β</span>) was 0.34 ± 0.12 L/kg and the volume of distribution at steady state (V<span class="Sub">ss</span>) was 0.26 ± 0.08 L/kg. The volume of distribution and clearance of ketorolac in pediatric patients was higher than those observed in adult subjects (see Table 1). There are no pharmacokinetic data available for administration of ketorolac tromethamine by the IM route in pediatric patients.</p>

<h4><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span></h4>
<p class="First">Based on single-dose data only, the mean half-life of ketorolac tromethamine in renally impaired patients is between 6 and 19 hours and is dependent on the extent of the impairment. There is poor correlation between creatinine clearance and total ketorolac tromethamine clearance in the elderly and populations with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (r = 0.5).</p>
<p>In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>, the AUC<span class="Sub">∞</span> of each enantiomer increased by approximately 100% compared with healthy volunteers. The volume of distribution doubles for the S-enantiomer and increases by 1/5th for the R-enantiomer. The increase in volume of distribution of ketorolac tromethamine implies an increase in unbound fraction.</p>
<p>The AUC<span class="Sub">∞</span>-ratio of the ketorolac tromethamine enantiomers in healthy subjects and patients remained similar, indicating there was no selective excretion of either enantiomer in patients compared to healthy subjects (see <a href="#i4i_section_id_9093d679-4e5e-4c4b-8655-aef4958ade1d">WARNINGS: Renal Effects</a>).</p>

<h2>Gastrointestinal Effects – Risk of Ulceration, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">Bleeding</span> and Perforation</h2>
<p class="First">Ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated in patients with previously documented <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4027663" conceptname="Peptic ulcer">peptic ulcers</span> and/or GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>. Ketorolac tromethamine can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, ulceration and perforation, of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with ketorolac tromethamine.</p>
<p>Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Minor upper gastrointestinal problems, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="23325" conceptname="Heartburn">dyspepsia</span>, are common and may also occur at any time during NSAID therapy. The incidence and severity of gastrointestinal complications increases with increasing dose of, and duration of treatment with, ketorolac tromethamine. Do not use ketorolac tromethamine for more than 5 days. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. In addition to past history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcer</span> disease, other factors that increase the risk for GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. </span>Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of ketorolac tromethamine until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.</p>
<p>NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4074815" conceptname="Inflammatory bowel disease">inflammatory bowel disease</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="81893" conceptname="Ulcerative colitis">ulcerative colitis</span>, Crohn’s disease) as their condition may be exacerbated.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">Hemorrhage</span></h2>
<p class="First">Because prostaglandins play an important role in hemostasis and NSAIDs affect platelet aggregation as well, use of ketorolac tromethamine in patients who have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432585" conceptname="Blood coagulation disorder">coagulation disorders</span> should be undertaken very cautiously, and those patients should be carefully monitored. Patients on therapeutic doses of anticoagulants (e.g., heparin or dicumarol derivatives) have an increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> complications if given ketorolac tromethamine concurrently; therefore, physicians should administer such concomitant therapy only extremely cautiously. The concurrent use of ketorolac tromethamine and therapy that affects hemostasis, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118659" conceptname="Prophylactic">prophylactic</span> low-dose heparin (2500 to 5000 units q12h), warfarin and dextrans have not been studied extensively, but may also be associated with an increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>. Until data from such studies are available, physicians should carefully weigh the benefits against the risks and use such concomitant therapy in these patients only extremely cautiously. Patients receiving therapy that affects hemostasis should be monitored closely.</p>
<p>In post-marketing experience, postoperative <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4147001" conceptname="Hematoma">hematomas</span> and other signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4343234" conceptname="Wound hemorrhage">wound bleeding</span> have been reported in association with the perioperative use of IV or IM dosing of ketorolac tromethamine. Therefore, perioperative use of ketorolac tromethamine should be avoided and postoperative use be undertaken with caution when hemostasis is critical (see <a href="#i4i_precautions_id_860b7c9a-c82a-4ed9-b18a-ccd305f2f132">PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>

<h2>Renal Effects</h2>
<p class="First">Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4152839" conceptname="Acute papillary necrosis">renal papillary necrosis</span> and other <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4220631" conceptname="Injury of kidney">renal injury</span>. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</p>
<p>Ketorolac tromethamine and its metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys, which, in patients with reduced creatinine clearance, will result in diminished clearance of the drug (see <a href="#ID_c47ad7da-85db-4cc7-8b25-5d06152247cc">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>). Therefore, ketorolac tromethamine should be used with caution in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> (see <a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_b32a4d0a-1f56-4057-bd33-b0c1094c8ad0">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>) and such patients should be followed closely.

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to 3 years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> (MI) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. </p>
<p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</p>
<p>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as ketorolac tromethamine, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events (see <a href="#i4i_warnings_id_1b02597b-565e-4de4-9021-b437e912d15d">WARNINGS</a>).</p>

<h4>Post-MI Patients </h4>
<p class="First">Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> in the first year <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">post MI</span> was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> in NSAID users persisted over at least the next 4 years of follow-up.</p>
<p>Avoid the use of ketorolac tromethamine in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events.

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hepatic Effect</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">Ketorolac tromethamine should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or a history of liver disease. Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including ketorolac tromethamine. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged or may be transient with continuing therapy. Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately 3 or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span> and fatal fulminant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4337543" conceptname="Hepatic necrosis">liver necrosis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic failure</span>, some of them with fatal outcomes have been reported.</p>
<p>A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with ketorolac tromethamine.

<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">Because serious GI tract ulcerations and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>.

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Ketorolac is highly bound to human plasma protein (mean 99.2%). There is no evidence in animal or human studies that ketorolac tromethamine induces or inhibits hepatic enzymes capable of metabolizing itself or other drugs.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="ID_98531a67-d228-46bd-971d-de95639a30d0"></a><a name="section-7.5.1"></a><p></p>
<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Warfarin, Digoxin, Salicylate and Heparin</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">The <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> binding of <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">warfarin</span></span> to plasma proteins is only slightly reduced by ketorolac tromethamine (99.5% control vs. 99.3%) when ketorolac plasma concentrations reach 5 to 10 mcg/mL. Ketorolac does not alter <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">digoxin</span></span> protein binding. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies indicate that, at therapeutic concentrations of <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">salicylate</span></span> (300 mcg/mL), the binding of ketorolac was reduced from approximately 99.2% to 97.5%, representing a potential 2-fold increase in unbound ketorolac plasma levels. Therapeutic concentrations of <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">digoxin, warfarin, ibuprofen, naproxen, piroxicam, acetaminophen, phenytoin</span></span> and <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">tolbutamide</span></span> did not alter ketorolac tromethamine protein binding.</p>
<p>In a study involving 12 adult volunteers, ketorolac tromethamine tablets were coadministered with a single-dose of 25 mg <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">warfarin</span></span>,causing no significant changes in pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of warfarin. In another study, ketorolac tromethamine dosed IV or IM was given with two doses of 5000 U of <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">heparin </span></span>to 11 healthy volunteers, resulting in a mean template <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4219104" conceptname="Bleeding time">bleeding time</span> of 6.4 minutes (3.2 to 11.4 min) compared to a mean of 6 minutes (3.4 to 7.5 min) for heparin alone and 5.1 minutes (3.5 to 8.5 min) for placebo. Although these results do not indicate a significant interaction between ketorolac tromethamine and warfarin or heparin, the administration of ketorolac tromethamine to patients taking anticoagulants should be done extremely cautiously and patients should be closely monitored (see <a href="#i4i_warnings_id_1b02597b-565e-4de4-9021-b437e912d15d">WARNINGS</a> and <a href="#i4i_section_id_e2911d59-11a2-42cd-b151-a6982975ee2f">PRECAUTIONS: Hematologic Effect</a>).</p>
<p>The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs, in general, on GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> are synergistic, such that the users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> higher than the users of either drug alone.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Aspirin</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">When ketorolac tromethamine is administered with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free ketorolac tromethamine is not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of ketorolac tromethamine and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Diuretics</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that ketorolac tromethamine can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> (see <a href="#i4i_section_id_9093d679-4e5e-4c4b-8655-aef4958ade1d">WARNINGS: Renal Effects</a>), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.</p>

<p class="First">Concomitant administration of ketorolac tromethamine tablets and <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">probenecid</span></span> resulted in decreased clearance and volume of distribution of ketorolac and significant increases in ketorolac plasma levels (total AUC increased approximately 3-fold from 5.4 to 17.8 mcg/h/mL) and terminal half-life increased approximately 2-fold from 6.6 to 15.1 hours. Therefore, concomitant use of ketorolac tromethamine tablets and probenecid is contraindicated.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Lithium</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium toxicity</span>.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">An 18-month study in mice with oral doses of ketorolac tromethamine at 2 mg/kg/day (0.9 times the human systemic exposure at the recommended IM or IV dose of 30 mg q.i.d., based on area-under-the-plasma-concentration curve [AUC]), and a 24-month study in rats at 5 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the human AUC) showed no evidence of tumorigenicity.</p>
<p>Ketorolac tromethamine was not mutagenic in the Ames test, unscheduled DNA synthesis and repair, and in forward mutation assays. Ketorolac tromethamine did not cause chromosome breakage in the <span class="Italics">in vivo </span>mouse micronucleus assay. At 1590 mcg/mL and at higher concentrations, ketorolac tromethamine increased the incidence of chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovarian cells.</p>
<p>Impairment of fertility did not occur in male or female rats at oral doses of 9 mg/kg (0.9 times the human AUC) and 16 mg/kg (1.6 times the human AUC) of ketorolac tromethamine, respectively.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Nonteratogenic Effects</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">Because of the known effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of ductus arteriosus), use during pregnancy (particularly late pregnancy) should be avoided. Oral doses of ketorolac tromethamine at 1.5 mg/kg (0.14 times the human AUC), administered after gestation day 17, caused dystocia and higher pup mortality in rats.</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well controlled studies of ketorolac tromethamine in pregnant women. Ketorolac tromethamine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<h2>Labor and Delivery</h2>
<p class="First">The use of ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated in labor and delivery because, through its prostaglandin synthesis inhibitory effect, it may adversely affect fetal circulation and inhibit uterine contractions, thus increasing the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="195876" conceptname="Hematometra">uterine hemorrhage</span> (see <a href="#i4i_contraindications_id_1547759c-315e-4823-8688-855a3003203d">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Effects on Fertility</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">The use of ketorolac tromethamine, as with any drug known to inhibit cyclooxygenase/prostaglandin synthesis, may impair fertility and is not recommended in women attempting to conceive. In women who have difficulty conceiving or are undergoing investigation of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4035976" conceptname="Sterility">infertility</span>, withdrawal of ketorolac tromethamine should be considered.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Limited data from one published study involving ten breast-feeding women 2 to 6 days postpartum showed low levels of ketorolac in breast milk. Levels were undetectable (less than 5 ng/mL) in four of the patients. After a single administration of 10 mg of oral ketorolac, the maximum milk concentration observed was 7.3 ng/mL, and the maximum milk-to-plasma ratio was 0.037. After 1 day of dosing (10 mg every 6 hours), the maximum milk concentration was 7.9 ng/mL, and the maximum milk-to-plasma ratio was 0.025. Assuming a daily intake of 400 to 1,000 mL of human milk per day and a maternal body weight of 60 kg, the calculated maximum daily infant exposure was 0.00263 mg/kg/day, which is 0.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose. </p>
<p>Exercise caution when ketorolac is administered to a nursing woman. Available information has not shown any specific adverse events in nursing infants; however, instruct patients to contact their infant's health care provider if they note any adverse events.</p>

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Ketorolac tromethamine tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness of ketorolac tromethamine tablets in pediatric patients below the age of 17 have not been established.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use (≥ 65 years of age)</h2>
<p class="First">Because ketorolac tromethamine may be cleared more slowly by the elderly (see <a href="#ID_c47ad7da-85db-4cc7-8b25-5d06152247cc">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>) who are also more sensitive to the dose related adverse effects of NSAIDs (see <a href="#i4i_section_id_87c55365-7dfc-495e-b041-a8fe965e053d">WARNINGS: Gastrointestinal Effects – Risk of Ulceration, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">Bleeding</span> and Perforation</a>), extreme caution, reduced dosages (see <a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_b32a4d0a-1f56-4057-bd33-b0c1094c8ad0">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>) and careful clinical monitoring must be used when treating the elderly with ketorolac tromethamine.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Adverse reaction rates increase with higher doses of ketorolac tromethamine. Practitioners should be alert for the severe complications of treatment with ketorolac tromethamine, such as G.I. ulceration, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> and perforation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002836" conceptname="Postoperative hemorrhage">postoperative bleeding</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span>, anaphylactic and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4148381" conceptname="Anaphylactoid reaction">anaphylactoid reactions</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">liver failure</span> (see <a href="#ID_c47ad7da-85db-4cc7-8b25-5d06152247cc">BOXED WARNING</a>, <a href="#i4i_warnings_id_1b02597b-565e-4de4-9021-b437e912d15d">WARNINGS</a>, <a href="#i4i_precautions_id_860b7c9a-c82a-4ed9-b18a-ccd305f2f132">PRECAUTIONS</a>, and <a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_b32a4d0a-1f56-4057-bd33-b0c1094c8ad0">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>). These NSAID-related complications can be serious in certain patients for whom ketorolac tromethamine is indicated, especially when the drug is used inappropriately.</p>
<p>In patients taking ketorolac tromethamine or other NSAIDs in clinical trials, the most frequently reported adverse experiences in approximately 1% to 10% of patients are:</p>
