<h1>TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-10.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Margin of Safety</h2>
<p class="First">The safety of two doses of IMPROVEST was evaluated in intact male swine. Thirty 9-week old intact boars received two subcutaneous doses of IMPROVEST in the same location 14 days apart. The boars received one of three treatments: Saline Control (12-mL), IMPROVEST at the intended dose (2-mL, 1×), or IMPROVEST at 6 times the intended dose (12-mL, 6×). Boars were clinically monitored daily. In addition, observation and measurement of injection sites, body weight, quantitative feed consumption, hematology, and clinical chemistry analyses were also obtained. A complete postmortem examination was conducted on each boar 14 days after the second injection. IMPROVEST, administered subcutaneously at the label dose (2-mL) resulted in mild transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4316202" conceptname="Injection site reaction">injection site reactions</span> at the 1× dose and caused clinical signs of systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> at 6× the intended dose. The signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> included <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4060220" conceptname="Stiff neck">stiffness</span> of the neck lasting up to five days, reduction in feed intake, and lower body weights. Multiple <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154927" conceptname="Joint swelling">swollen joints</span> and associated lameness, which may be signs of systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span>, were observed in one 6× boar. Evaluation of blood work revealed increased white blood cell counts (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302954" conceptname="Disorder characterized by eosinophilia">eosinophilia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4189647" conceptname="Neutrophilia">neutrophilia</span>); slight increases in total serum protein (above normal reference range in 50% of the 6× boars) and globulin (above the normal reference range in 40% of the 6× boars); and slight decreases in serum albumin in 6× boars. Injection sites for the 6× boars showed clinically detectable firmness persisting in all animals for 14 days after the second injection. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">Pain</span> and sensitivity at the injection site persisted for up to five days, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span> and heat were more prominent in the 6× boars than in the 1× boars. Mild to moderate chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> and discoloration in the subcutaneous tissues at the injection site were observed. In all IMPROVEST treated boars, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4028206" conceptname="Atrophy">atrophy</span> of testes, prostate, and bulbourethral glands were observed as expected consequences associated with the intended effect of the drug.

<a name="section-10.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Injection Site Safety</h2>
<p class="First">Injection site safety was evaluated following the injection of IMPROVEST into healthy 17-week old boars. The treated boars received two 2-mL doses of IMPROVEST into the same injection site location 28 days apart, while the control boars received saline. Daily monitoring included clinical evaluation and observation and measurement of injection sites. Two days after the second injection, postmortem observations of injection sites were conducted. All clinical signs of observable <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4319319" conceptname="Injection site edema">injection site swelling</span> were resolved within 24 hours, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> on palpation resolved by 48 hours post-injection. Firmness persisted for up to 11 days after the first injection in 10% of boars. Gross injection site alterations consisted of subcutaneous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span> with tan or red discoloration. Two 2-mL injections of IMPROVEST, administered 28 days apart into the same location resulted in transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4316202" conceptname="Injection site reaction">injection site reactions</span> following each injection and resulted in discoloration of tissue at the injection site which was observable approximately 48 hours after the second injection.</p>

<h2>Field Safety</h2>
<p class="First">During the conduct of the nine location field effectiveness study, IMPROVEST did not cause unusual clinical signs or an unexpected frequency or severity of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4316202" conceptname="Injection site reaction">injection site reactions</span>. The field safety observations from this study were consistent with the observations made during the target animal safety studies of transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> at the injection sites.

<h1>EFFECTIVENESS</h1>
<p class="First">IMPROVEST is an injectable sterile solution containing an incomplete analog of natural gonadotropin releasing factor (GnRF) conjugated to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434568" conceptname="Diphtheria">diphtheria</span> toxoid in an adjuvanted formulation. Immunization with a two dose regimen of IMPROVEST, with a four week interval between doses, stimulates the pig's immune system to produce antibodies which can neutralize its own GnRF. Pigs given an initial dose of IMPROVEST are immunologically primed but do not produce sufficient antibodies to have any physiological effect. Following receipt of the second dose, the pig's immune system responds with a strong antibody response. These antibodies bind to and neutralize circulating GnRF in the bloodstream. Neutralization of GnRF blocks the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal endocrine axis, thereby suppressing testicular function, including both sex hormone production and reproductive capability, thereby providing temporary immunological castration in these injected boars.</p>
<p>Evidence of temporary immunological castration was provided in a series of studies showing that within 1-2 weeks after the second injection of IMPROVEST, anti-GnRF antibody levels increase significantly. With this rise in anti-GnRF antibodies, the levels of gonadal sex hormones were substantially reduced, the size of the testes, and spermatogenesis suppressed, as was the expression of typical male behaviors (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021344" conceptname="Abusive behavior">aggression</span> and sexual, e.g., mounting). Full immunological castration was demonstrated to last from 4 to 8 weeks after the second dose. IMPROVEST injected boars will start to return to full reproductive function at a variable period after this time, as evidenced by increases in male sex hormones, testicle size, and intact male behavior. IMPROVEST should not be used in boars intended for breeding purposes.</p>
<p>Evidence to assess the acceptability of pork from IMPROVEST treated pigs was provided through a series of consumer taste panels using consumers deemed sensitive to the taste of "tainted" meat. The presence of boar taint was evaluated on the basis of pork aroma and flavor and not by chemical analysis. Three consumer taste panel studies were conducted to demonstrate the difference of pork generated from IMPROVEST treated and intact boars. A surgically castrated male group was not evaluated during these studies. In these three studies, 465 sensitive consumers evaluated cooked pork loin samples from IMPROVEST treated and intact boars. These pigs were raised to market weight, injected with IMPROVEST as per product labeling and slaughtered 4 to 8 weeks after receipt of the second IMPROVEST injection. The consumers found the aroma and flavor of pork from the IMPROVEST injected pigs to be more acceptable than from the intact boars in all three studies.</p>
