<h1>DESCRIPTION </h1>
<p class="First">DISALCID (Salsalate) TABLETS contain the active ingredient Salsalate, which is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent for oral administration. Chemically, salsalate (salicylsalicylic acid or 2-hydroxy-benzoic acid, 2-carboxyphenyl ester) is a dimer of salicylic acid; its structural formula is shown below.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Chemical Structure:</span></p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="ChemStruc" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=30371119-beaf-4ade-a9d5-12adc09f7827&amp;name=30371119-beaf-4ade-a9d5-12adc09f7827-01.jpg"></div>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY </h1>
<p class="First">Salsalate is insoluble in acid gastric fluids (&lt;0.1 mg/mL at pH 1.0), but readily soluble in the small intestine where it is partially hydrolyzed to two molecules of salicylic acid. A significant portion of the parent compound is absorbed unchanged and undergoes rapid esterase hydrolysis in the body: its half-life is about one hour. About 13% is excreted through the kidneys as a glucuronide conjugate of the parent compound, the remainder as salicylic acid and its metabolites. Thus, the amount of salicylic acid available from salsalate is about 15% less than from aspirin, when the two drugs are administered on a salicylic acid molar equivalent basis (3.6 g salsalate/5 g aspirin). Salicylic acid biotransformation is saturated at anti-inflammatory doses of salsalate. Such capacity-limited biotransformation results in an increase in the half-life of salicylic acid from 3.5 to 16 or more hours. Thus, dosing with salsalate twice a day will satisfactorily maintain blood levels within the desired therapeutic range (10 to 30 mg/100 mL) throughout the 12-hour intervals. Therapeutic blood levels continue for up to 16 hours after the last dose. The parent compound does not show capacity-limited biotransformation, nor does it accumulate in the plasma on multiple dosing. Food slows the absorption of all salicylates including salsalate.</p>
<p>The mode of anti-inflammatory action of salsalate and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is not fully defined. Although salicylic acid (the primary metabolite of salsalate) is a weak inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">in vitro</span></span>, salsalate appears to selectively inhibit prostaglandin synthesis <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">in vivo</span></span><span class="Sup">1</span>, providing anti-inflammatory activity equivalent to aspirin<span class="Sup">2</span> and indomethacin<span class="Sup">3</span>. Unlike aspirin, salsalate does not inhibit platelet aggregation<span class="Sup">4</span>. The usefulness of salicylic acid, the active <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">in vivo</span></span> product of salsalate, in the treatment of arthritic disorders has been established<span class="Sup">5,6</span>. In contrast to aspirin, salsalate causes no greater fecal gastrointestinal blood loss than placebo<span class="Sup">7</span>.</p>

<h1>CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</span></p>
<p>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious Gastrointestinal (GI) events (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s5.4">Gastrointestinal WARNINGS</a></span>).</p>
<p>Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> in the first 10-14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s4">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span>).</p>

<h1>Gastrointestinal Effects-Risk of Ulceration, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">Bleeding</span>, and Perforation</h1>
<p class="First">NSAIDs, including DISALCID (Salsalate) TABLETS, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcers</span>, gross <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2-4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy.</p>
<p>However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcer</span> disease or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">gastrointestinal bleeding</span>. Patients with a prior history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4027663" conceptname="Peptic ulcer">peptic ulcer disease</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">gastrointestinal bleeding</span> who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">GI bleed</span> compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.</p>

<h1>Renal Effects</h1>

Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly.

<a name="s6.1"></a><a name="section-15.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>General </h2>
<p class="First">Patients on treatment with salsalate should be warned not to take other salicylates so as to avoid potentially toxic concentrations. Great care should be exercised when salsalate is prescribed in the presence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198185" conceptname="Chronic renal failure">chronic renal insufficiency</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4027663" conceptname="Peptic ulcer">peptic ulcer disease</span>.

<p>Although cross reactivity, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256717" conceptname="Bronchospasm">bronchospasm</span>, has been reported occasionally with non-acetylated salicylates, including salsalate, in aspirin-sensitive patients<span class="Sup">8,9</span>, salsalate is less likely than aspirin to induce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> in such patients<span class="Sup">10</span>.</p>
<p>DISALCID (Salsalate) TABLETS cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids.

<h1>Hepatic Effects </h1>
<p class="First">Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including DISALCID (Salsalate) TABLETS. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with continuing therapy. Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately three or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span> and fatal fulminant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4337543" conceptname="Hepatic necrosis">liver necrosis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic failure</span>, some of them with fatal outcomes have been reported.</p>
<p>A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with DISALCID (Salsalate) TABLETS.

<h1>LABORATORY TESTS </h1>
<p class="First">Plasma salicylic acid concentrations should be periodically monitored during long-term treatment with salsalate to aid maintenance of therapeutically effective levels: 10 to 30 mg/100 mL. Toxic manifestations are not usually seen until plasma concentrations exceed 30 mg/100 mL (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s19">OVERDOSAGE</a></span>). Urinary pH should also be regularly monitored: sudden acidification, as from pH 6.5 to 5.5, can double the plasma level, resulting in toxicity.</p>
<p>Because serious GI tract ulcerations and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, should have their CBC and a chemistry profile checked periodically. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span> develop, systemic manifestations occur (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302954" conceptname="Disorder characterized by eosinophilia">eosinophilia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>, etc.) or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, DISALCID (Salsalate) TABLETS should be discontinued.</p>

<h1>DRUG INTERACTIONS </h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">ACE-inhibitors</span></p>
<p>Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Aspirin</span></p>
<p>Salicylates antagonize the uricosuric action of drugs used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440674" conceptname="Gout">gout</span>. ASPIRIN AND OTHER SALICYLATE DRUGS WILL BE ADDITIVE TO SALSALATE AND MAY INCREASE PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS OF SALICYLIC ACID TO TOXIC LEVELS. Drugs and foods that raise urine pH will increase renal clearance and urinary excretion of salicylic acid, thus lowering plasma levels: acidifying drugs or foods will decrease urinary excretion and increase plasma levels. Salicylates given concomitantly with anticoagulant drugs may predispose to systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>. Salicylates may enhance the hypoglycemic effect of oral antidiabetic drugs of the sulfonylurea class. Salicylate competes with a number of drugs for protein binding sites, notably penicillin, thiopental, thyroxine, triiodothyronine, phenytoin, sulfinpyrazone, naproxen, warfarin, methotrexate, and possibly corticosteroids. [When DISALCID (Salsalate) TABLETS is administered with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free DISALCID (Salsalate) TABLETS is not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however,] as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of salsalate and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Furosemide</span></p>
<p>Clinical studies, as well as post marketing observations, have shown that DISALCID (Salsalate) TABLETS can reduce the natriuretic effect-of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s5.5">PRECAUTIONS, Renal Effects</a></span>), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Lithium</span></p>
<p>NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium toxicity</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Methotrexate</span></p>
<p>NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Warfarin</span></p>
<p>The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> higher than users of either drug alone.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: </span>Salicylate competes with thyroid hormone for binding to plasma proteins, which may be reflected in a depressed plasma T<span class="Sub">4</span> value in some patients; thyroid function and basal metabolism are unaffected.</p>

<h1>Nursing Mothers</h1>
<p class="First">It is not known whether salsalate as such is excreted in human milk; salicylic acid, the primary metabolite of salsalate, has been shown to appear in human milk in concentrations approximating the maternal blood level. Thus, the infant of a mother on salsalate therapy might ingest in mother’s milk 30 to 80% as much salicylate per kg body weight as the mother is taking. Accordingly, caution should be exercised when salsalate is administered to a nursing woman.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION </h1>
<p class="First">Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of DISALCID (Salsalate) TABLETS and other treatment options before deciding to use DISALCID (Salsalate) TABLETS. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s5">WARNINGS</a></span>).</p>
<p>After observing the response to initial therapy with DISALCID (Salsalate) TABLETS, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.

<p><span class="Bold">Adults: </span>The usual dosage is 3000 mg daily, given in divided doses as follows:</p>
<p>1) two doses of two 750 mg tablets; 2) two doses of three 500 mg tablets; or 3) three doses of two 500 mg tablets. Some patients, e.g., the elderly, may require a lower dosage to achieve therapeutic blood concentrations and to avoid the more common side effects such as auditory.</p>
<p>Alleviation of symptoms is gradual, and full benefit may not be evident for 3 to 4 days, when plasma salicylate levels have achieved steady state. There is no evidence for development of tissue tolerance (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052861" conceptname="Tachyphylaxis">tachyphylaxis</span>), but salicylate therapy may induce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">increased activity</span> of metabolizing liver enzymes, causing a greater rate of salicyluric acid production and excretion, with a resultant increase in dosage requirement for maintenance of therapeutic serum salicylate levels.</p>
