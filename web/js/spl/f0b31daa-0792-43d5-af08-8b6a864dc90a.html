<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<a href="http://"></a>Mechanism of Action<p class="First">Breast cancer cell growth may be estrogen-dependent. Aromatase is 
the principal enzyme that converts <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4233066" conceptname="Androgen level">androgens</span> to estrogens both in pre- and 
postmenopausal women. While the main source of estrogen (primarily estradiol) is 
the ovary in premenopausal women, the principal source of circulating estrogens 
in postmenopausal women is from conversion of adrenal and ovarian <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4233066" conceptname="Androgen level">androgens</span> 
(androstenedione and testosterone) to estrogens (estrone and estradiol) by the 
aromatase enzyme in peripheral tissues. Estrogen deprivation through aromatase 
inhibition is an effective and selective treatment for some postmenopausal 
patients with hormone-dependent breast cancer.</p>
<p>Exemestane is an irreversible, steroidal aromatase inactivator, structurally 
related to the natural substrate androstenedione. It acts as a false substrate 
for the aromatase enzyme, and is processed to an intermediate that binds 
irreversibly to the active site of the enzyme causing its inactivation, an 
effect also known as "<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span> inhibition." Exemestane significantly lowers 
circulating estrogen concentrations in postmenopausal women, but has no 
detectable effect on adrenal biosynthesis of corticosteroids or aldosterone. 
Exemestane has no effect on other enzymes involved in the steroidogenic pathway 
up to a concentration at least 600 times higher than that inhibiting the 
aromatase enzyme.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pharmacokinetics<p>Following oral administration to healthy postmenopausal women, 
exemestane is rapidly absorbed. After maximum plasma concentration is reached, 
levels decline polyexponentially with a mean terminal half-life of about 24 
hours. Exemestane is extensively distributed and is cleared from the systemic 
circulation primarily by metabolism. The pharmacokinetics of exemestane are dose 
proportional after single (10 to 200 mg) or repeated oral doses (0.5 to 50 mg). 
Following repeated daily doses of exemestane 25 mg, plasma concentrations of 
unchanged drug are similar to levels measured after a single dose.</p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic parameters in postmenopausal women with advanced breast 
cancer following single or repeated doses have been compared with those in 
healthy, postmenopausal women. Exemestane appeared to be more rapidly absorbed 
in the women with breast cancer than in the healthy women, with a mean t<span class="Sub">max</span> of 1.2 hours in the women with breast cancer and 2.9 hours 
in the healthy women. After repeated dosing, the average oral clearance in women 
with advanced breast cancer was 45% lower than the oral clearance in healthy 
postmenopausal women, with corresponding higher systemic exposure. Mean AUC 
values following repeated doses in women with breast cancer (75.4 ng∙h/mL) were 
about twice those in healthy women (41.4 ng∙h/mL). </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Absorption<p>Following oral administration of radiolabeled exemestane, at 
least 42% of radioactivity was absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. 
Exemestane plasma levels increased by approximately 40% after a high-fat 
breakfast. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Distribution<p>Exemestane is distributed extensively into tissues. Exemestane is 
90% bound to plasma proteins and the fraction bound is independent of the total 
concentration. Albumin and α<span class="Sub">1</span>-acid glycoprotein both 
contribute to the binding. The distribution of exemestane and its metabolites 
into blood cells is negligible. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Metabolism and Excretion<p>Following administration of radiolabeled exemestane to healthy 
postmenopausal women, the cumulative amounts of radioactivity excreted in urine 
and feces were similar (42 ± 3% in urine and 42 ± 6% in feces over a 1-week 
collection period). The amount of drug excreted unchanged in urine was less than 
1% of the dose. Exemestane is extensively metabolized, with levels of the 
unchanged drug in plasma accounting for less than 10% of the total 
radioactivity. The initial steps in the metabolism of exemestane are oxidation 
of the methylene group in position 6 and reduction of the 17-keto group with 
subsequent formation of many secondary metabolites. Each metabolite accounts 
only for a limited amount of drug-related material. The metabolites are inactive 
or inhibit aromatase with decreased potency compared with the parent drug. One 
metabolite may have androgenic activity (see <a href="#Other_Endocrine_Effects">Pharmacodynamics, Other Endocrine Effects</a>). 
Studies using human liver preparations indicate that cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP 
3A4) is the principal isoenzyme involved in the oxidation of exemestane. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Special Populations <a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Geriatric<p>Healthy postmenopausal women aged 43 to 68 years were studied in 
the pharmacokinetic trials. Age-related alterations in exemestane 
pharmacokinetics were not seen over this age range.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Gender<p>The pharmacokinetics of exemestane following administration of a 
single, 25-mg tablet to fasted healthy males (mean age 32 years) were similar to 
the pharmacokinetics of exemestane in fasted healthy postmenopausal women (mean 
age 55 years).</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Race<p>The influence of race on exemestane pharmacokinetics has not been 
evaluated.</p>

subjects with moderate or severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic insufficiency</span> (Childs-Pugh B or C). 
Following a single 25-mg oral dose, the AUC of exemestane was approximately 3 
times higher than that observed in healthy volunteers (see <a href="#pre">PRECAUTIONS</a>). </p>

(creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>) compared

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pediatric<p>The pharmacokinetics of exemestane have not been studied in

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Drug-Drug Interactions<p>Exemestane is metabolized by cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) and 
aldoketoreductases. It does not inhibit any of the major CYP isoenzymes, 
including CYP 1A2, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4. In a clinical pharmacokinetic study, 
ketoconazole showed no significant influence on the pharmacokinetics of 
exemestane. Although no other formal drug-drug interaction studies have been 
conducted, significant effects on exemestane clearance by CYP isoenzymes 
inhibitors appear unlikely. In a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interaction</span> study of 10 healthy 
postmenopausal volunteers pretreated with potent CYP 3A4 inducer rifampicin 600 
mg daily for 14 days followed by a single dose of exemestane 25 mg, the mean 
plasma C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC <span class="Sub">0–∞</span> of 
exemestane were decreased by 41% and 54%, respectively (see <a href="#pre">PRECAUTIONS</a> and <a href="#doad">DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pharmacodynamics<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Effect on Estrogens<p>Multiple doses of exemestane ranging from 0.5 to 600 mg/day were 
administered to postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. Plasma 
estrogen (estradiol, estrone, and estrone sulfate) suppression was seen starting 
at a 5-mg daily dose of exemestane, with a maximum suppression of at least 85% 
to 95% achieved at a 25-mg dose. Exemestane 25 mg daily reduced whole body 
aromatization (as measured by injecting radiolabeled androstenedione) by 98% in 
postmenopausal women with breast cancer. After a single dose of exemestane 25 
mg, the maximal suppression of circulating estrogens occurred 2 to 3 days after 
dosing and persisted for 4 to 5 days.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Effect on Corticosteroids<p>In multiple-dose trials of doses up to 200 mg daily, exemestane 
selectivity was assessed by examining its effect on adrenal steroids. Exemestane 
did not affect cortisol or aldosterone secretion at baseline or in response to 
ACTH at any dose. Thus, no glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid replacement 
therapy is necessary with exemestane treatment.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Other Endocrine Effects<p>Exemestane does not bind significantly to steroidal receptors, 
except for a slight affinity for the androgen receptor (0.28% relative to 
dihydrotestosterone). The binding affinity of its 17-dihydrometabolite for the 
androgen receptor, however, is 100-times that of the parent compound. Daily 
doses of exemestane up to 25 mg had no significant effect on circulating levels 
of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, or 17-hydroxyprogesterone, 
and were associated with small decreases in circulating levels of testosterone. 
Increases in testosterone and androstenedione levels have been observed at daily 
doses of 200 mg or more. A dose-dependent decrease in sex hormone binding 
globulin (SHBG) has been observed with daily exemestane doses of 2.5 mg or 
higher. Slight, nondose-dependent increases in serum luteinizing hormone (LH) 
and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels have been observed even at low 
doses as a consequence of feedback at the pituitary level. Exemestane 25 mg 
daily had no significant effect on thyroid function [free triiodothyronine 
(FT3), free thyroxine (FT4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)]. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Coagulation and Lipid Effects<p>In study 027 of postmenopausal women with early breast cancer 
treated with exemestane (N=73) or placebo (N=73), there was no change in the

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<a href="#section-"></a>Adjuvant Treatment in Early Breast Cancer<p class="First">The Intergroup Exemestane Study 031 (IES) was a randomized, 
double-blind, multicenter, multinational study comparing exemestane (25 mg/day) 
versus tamoxifen (20 or 30 mg/day) in postmenopausal women with early breast 
cancer. Patients who remained disease-free after receiving adjuvant tamoxifen 
therapy for 2 to 3 years were randomized to receive 3 to 2 years of AROMASIN or 
tamoxifen to complete a total of 5 years of hormonal therapy.</p>
<p>The primary objective of the study was to determine whether, in terms of 
disease-free survival, it was more effective to switch to AROMASIN rather than 
continuing tamoxifen therapy for the remainder of five years. Disease-free 
survival was defined as the time from randomization to time of local or distant 
recurrence of breast cancer, contralateral invasive breast cancer, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> from 
any cause. </p>
<p>The secondary objectives were to compare the two regimens in terms of overall 
survival and long-term tolerability. Time to contralateral invasive breast 
cancer and distant recurrence-free survival were also evaluated.</p>
<p>A total of 4724 patients in the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis were 
randomized to AROMASIN (exemestane tablets) 25 mg once daily (N = 2352) or to 
continue to receive tamoxifen once daily at the same dose received before 
randomization (N = 2372). Demographics and baseline tumor characteristics are 
presented in Table 1. Prior breast cancer therapy is summarized in Table 2.</p>

randomized double-blind, multicenter, multinational comparative study and in two 
multicenter single-arm studies of postmenopausal women with advanced breast

<p>The primary purpose of the three studies was evaluation of objective response 
rate (complete response [CR] and partial response [PR]). Time to tumor 
progression and overall survival were also assessed in the comparative trial. 
Response rates were assessed based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, 
and in the comparative study, were submitted to an external review committee 
that was blinded to patient treatment. In the comparative study, 769 patients 
were randomized to receive AROMASIN (exemestane tablets) 25 mg once daily (N = 
366) or megestrol acetate 40 mg four times daily (N = 403). Demographics and 
baseline characteristics are presented in Table 5.</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">AROMASIN is indicated for adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal 
women with estrogen-receptor positive early breast cancer who have received two 
to three years of tamoxifen and are switched to AROMASIN for completion of a 
total of five consecutive years of adjuvant hormonal therapy.</p>
<p>AROMASIN is indicated for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in 
postmenopausal women whose disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34070-3">
<a name="section-6"></a><p></p>
<h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h1>
<p class="First">AROMASIN Tablets are contraindicated in patients with a known <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> 
to the drug or to any of the excipients.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34071-1">
<a name="section-7"></a><p></p>
<h1>WARNINGS </h1>
<p class="First">AROMASIN Tablets may cause fetal harm when administered to a 
pregnant woman. Radioactivity related to <span class="Sup">14</span>C-exemestane 
crossed the placenta of rats following oral administration of 1 mg/kg 
exemestane. The concentration of exemestane and its metabolites was 
approximately equivalent in maternal and fetal blood. When rats were 
administered exemestane from 14 days prior to mating until either days 15 or 20 
of gestation, and resuming for the 21 days of lactation, an increase in 
placental weight was seen at 4 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.5 times the 
recommended human daily dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). Prolonged 
gestation and abnormal or difficult labor was observed at doses equal to or 
greater than 20 mg/kg/day. Increased resorption, reduced number of live fetuses, 
decreased fetal weight, and retarded ossification were also observed at these 
doses. No malformations were noted when exemestane was administered to pregnant 
rats during the organogenesis period at doses up to 810 mg/kg/day (approximately 
320 times the recommended human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). 
Daily doses of exemestane, given to rabbits during organogenesis caused a 
decrease in placental weight at 90 mg/kg/day (approximately 70 times the 
recommended human daily dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). 
Abortions, an increase in resorptions, and a reduction in fetal body weight were 
seen at 270 mg/kg/day. There was no increase in the incidence of malformations 
in rabbits at doses up to 270 mg/kg/day (approximately 210 times the recommended 
human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).</p>
<p>There are no studies in pregnant women using AROMASIN. AROMASIN is indicated 
for postmenopausal women. If there is exposure to AROMASIN during pregnancy, the 
patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and potential 
risk for loss of the pregnancy.</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<a href="http://"></a>General<p class="First">AROMASIN Tablets should not be administered to premenopausal 
women. AROMASIN should not be coadministered with estrogen-containing agents as 
these could interfere with its pharmacologic action.</p>

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Laboratory Tests<p>In patients with early breast cancer the incidence of 
hematological abnormalities of Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grade greater than or equal to 1 was lower 
in the exemestane treatment group, compared with tamoxifen. Incidence of CTC 
grade 3 or 4 abnormalities was low (approximately 0.1%) in both treatment 
groups. Approximately 20% of patients receiving exemestane in clinical studies 
in advanced breast cancer, experienced CTC grade 3 or 4 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441541" conceptname="Lymphocytopenia">lymphocytopenia</span>. Of 
these patients, 89% had a pre-existing lower grade <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441541" conceptname="Lymphocytopenia">lymphopenia</span>. Forty percent of 
patients either recovered or improved to a lesser severity while on treatment. 
Patients did not have a significant increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440029" conceptname="Viral disease">viral infections</span>, and no 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4247535" conceptname="Opportunistic infectious disease">opportunistic infections</span> were observed. Elevations of serum levels of AST, ALT, 
alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl transferase less than greater than 5 times the upper value 
of the normal range (i.e., greater than or equal to  CTC grade 3) have been rarely reported in patients 
treated for advanced breast cancer but appear mostly attributable to the 
underlying presence of liver and/or bone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432851" conceptname="Secondary malignant neoplastic disease">metastases</span>. In the comparative study in 
advanced breast cancer patients, CTC grade 3 or 4 elevation of gamma glutamyl 
transferase without documented evidence of liver <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4147162" conceptname="Secondary malignant neoplasm of respiratory and digestive systems">metastasis</span> was reported in 2.7% 
of patients treated with AROMASIN and in 1.8% of patients treated with megestrol 
acetate.</p>
<p>In patients with early breast cancer, elevations in bilirubin, alkaline 
phosphatase, and creatinine were more common in those receiving exemestane than 
either tamoxifen or placebo. Treatment emergent bilirubin elevations (any CTC 
grade) occurred in 5.3% of exemestane patients and 0.8% of tamoxifen patients on 
the IES, and in 6.9% of exemestane treated patients vs. 0% of placebo treated 
patients on the 027 study. CTC grade 3–4 increases in bilirubin occurred in 0.9% 
of exemestane treated patients compared to 0.1% of tamoxifen treated patients. 
Alkaline phosphatase elevations of any CTC grade occurred in 15.0% of exemestane 
treated patients on the IES compared to 2.6% of tamoxifen treated patients, and 
in 13.7% of exemestane treated patients compared to 6.9% of placebo treated 
patients on study 027. Creatinine elevations occurred in 5.8% of exemestane 
treated patients and 4.3% of tamoxifen treated patients on the IES and in 5.5% 
of exemestane treated patients and 0% of placebo treated patients on study 
027.</p>
<p>Reductions in bone mineral density (BMD) over time are seen with exemestane 
use. Table 7 describes changes in BMD from baseline to 24 months in patients 
receiving exemestane compared to patients receiving tamoxifen (IES) or placebo 
(027). Concomitant use of bisphosphonates, Vitamin D supplementation and Calcium 
was not allowed.</p>

</table>*   For patients who had 24-month data.<br><br><a href="http://"></a>Drug Interactions<p>Exemestane is extensively metabolized by CYP 3A4, but 
coadministration of ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP 3A4, has no 
significant effect on exemestane pharmacokinetics. Significant pharmacokinetic 
interactions mediated by inhibition of CYP isoenzymes therefore appear unlikely. 
Co-medications that induce CYP 3A4 (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, 
phenobarbital, or St. John's wort) may significantly decrease exposure to 
exemestane. Dose modification is recommended for patients who are also receiving 
a potent CYP 3A4 inducer (see <a href="#doad">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a> and

386 and 5667 ± 1833 ng.hr/mL in males and females (approx. 34 and 75 fold the 
AUC in postmenopausal patients at the recommended clinical dose). An increased 
incidence of renal tubular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> was observed in male mice at the high dose 
of 450 mg/kg/day. Since the doses tested in mice did not achieve an MTD, 
neoplastic findings in organs other than liver and kidneys remain unknown. </p>
<p>A separate carcinogenicity study was conducted in rats at the doses of 30, 
100 and 315 mg/kg/day exemestane (gavage) for 92 weeks in males and 2 years in 
females. No evidence of carcinogenic activity up to the highest dose tested of 
315 mg/kg/day was observed in females. The male rat study was inconclusive since 
it was terminated prematurely at Week 92. At the highest dose, plasma AUC<span class="Sub">(0–24hr)</span> levels in male (1418 ± 287 ng.hr/mL) and female (2318 
± 1067 ng.hr/mL) rats were 19 and 31 fold higher than those measured in 
postmenopausal cancer patients, receiving the recommended clinical dose.</p>
<p>Exemestane was not mutagenic in vitro in bacteria (Ames test) or mammalian 
cells (V79 Chinese hamster lung cells). Exemestane was clastogenic in human 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span> in vitro without metabolic activation but was not clastogenic in 
vivo (micronucleus assay in mouse bone marrow). Exemestane did not increase 
unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes when tested in vitro.</p>
<p>In a pilot reproductive study in rats, male rats were treated with doses of 
125–1000 mg/kg/day exemestane, beginning 63 days prior to and during 
cohabitation. Untreated female rats showed reduced fertility when mated to males 
treated with greater than or equal to 500 mg/kg/day exemestane (greater than or equal to 200 times the recommended human dose on 
a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). In a separate study, exemestane was given 
to female rats at 4–100 mg/kg/day beginning 14 days prior to mating and through 
day 15 or 20 of gestation. Exemestane increased the placental weights at greater than or equal to 4 
mg/kg/day greater than or equal to 1.5 times the human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). 
Exemestane showed no effects on ovarian function, mating behavior, and 
conception rate in rats given doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 8 times 
the recommended human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis), however, 
decreases in mean litter size and fetal body weight, along with delayed 
ossification were evidenced at greater than or equal to 20 mg/kg/day. In general toxicology studies, 
changes in the ovary, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4296894" conceptname="Hyperplasia">hyperplasia</span>, an increase in the incidence of 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="193530" conceptname="Follicular cyst of ovary">ovarian cysts</span> and a decrease in corpora lutea were observed with variable 
frequency in mice, rats and dogs at doses that ranged from 3–20 times the human

radioactivity related to exemestane appeared in rat milk within 15 minutes of

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<a href="http://"></a>Adjuvant Treatment of Early Breast Cancer<p class="First">AROMASIN tolerability in postmenopausal women with early breast 
cancer was evaluated in two well-controlled trials: the IES study (see <a href="#CLINICAL_STUDIES">CLINICAL STUDIES</a>) and the 027 study (a randomized, 
placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group study specifically designed to 
assess the effects of exemestane on bone metabolism, hormones, lipids and 
coagulation factors over 2 years of treatment).</p>
<p>Certain adverse events, expected based on the known pharmacological 
properties and side effect profiles of test drugs, were actively sought through 
a positive checklist. Signs and symptoms were graded for severity using CTC in 
both studies. Within the IES study, the presence of some illnesses/conditions 
was monitored through a positive checklist without assessment of severity. These 
included <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, other <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134057" conceptname="Disorder of cardiovascular system">cardiovascular disorders</span>, gynecological

hospitalizations.</p>
<p>The median duration of adjuvant treatment was 27.4 months and 27.3 months for 
patients receiving AROMASIN or tamoxifen, respectively, within the IES study and 
23.9 months for patients receiving AROMASIN or placebo within the 027 study. 
Median duration of observation after randomization for AROMASIN was 34.5 months 
and for tamoxifen was 34.6 months. Median duration of observation was 30 months 
for both groups in the 027 study.</p>
<p>AROMASIN was generally well tolerated and adverse events were usually mild to 
moderate. Within the IES study discontinuations due to adverse events occurred 
in 6.3% and 5.1% of patients receiving AROMASIN and tamoxifen, respectively, and 
in 12.3% and 4.1% of patients receiving exemestane or placebo within study 027. 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Deaths</span> due to any cause were reported for 1.3% of the exemestane-treated 
patients and 1.4% of the tamoxifen-treated patients within the IES study. There

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Clinical trials have been conducted with exemestane given as a 
single dose to healthy female volunteers at doses as high as 800 mg and daily 
for 12 weeks to postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer at doses as 
high as 600 mg. These dosages were well tolerated. There is no specific antidote 
to overdosage and treatment must be symptomatic. General supportive care, 
including frequent monitoring of vital signs and close observation of the 
patient, is indicated.</p>
<p>A male child (age unknown) accidentally ingested a 25-mg tablet of 
exemestane. The initial physical examination was normal, but blood tests 
performed 1 hour after ingestion indicated leucocytosis (WBC 25000/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> with 90% <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4148615" conceptname="Neutrophil count">neutrophils</span>). Blood tests were repeated 4 days after 
the incident and were normal. No treatment was given.</p>
<p>In mice, mortality was observed after a single oral dose of exemestane of 
3200 mg/kg, the lowest dose tested (about 640 times the recommended human dose 
on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). In rats and dogs, mortality was 
observed after single oral doses of exemestane of 5000 mg/kg (about 2000 times 
the recommended human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) and of 3000 
mg/kg (about 4000 times the recommended human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis), respectively.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">Convulsions</span> were observed after single doses of exemestane of 400 mg/kg and 
3000 mg/kg in mice and dogs (approximately 80 and 4000 times the recommended 
human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis), respectively.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">The recommended dose of AROMASIN in early and advanced breast 
cancer is one 25 mg tablet once daily after a meal. </p>
<p>In postmenopausal women with early breast cancer who have been treated with 
2–3 years of tamoxifen, treatment with AROMASIN should continue in the absence 
of recurrence or contralateral breast cancer until completion of five years of 
adjuvant endocrine therapy.</p>
<p>For patients with advanced breast cancer, treatment with AROMASIN should 
continue until <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168352" conceptname="Tumor progression">tumor progression</span> is evident. </p>
<p>For patients receiving AROMASIN with a potent CYP 3A4 inducer such as 
rifampicin or phenytoin, the recommended dose of AROMASIN is 50 mg once daily 
after a meal.</p>
<p>The safety of chronic dosing in patients with moderate or severe hepatic or 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> has not been studied. Based on experience with exemestane at 
repeated doses up to 200 mg daily that demonstrated a moderate increase in 
non-life threatening adverse events, dosage adjustment does not appear to be 
necessary (see <a href="#Special_Populations">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Special 
Populations</a> and <a href="#pre">PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>
