<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</h1>
<p class="First">The mode of action of Gold Sodium Thiomalate is unknown. The predominant action appears to be a suppressive effect on the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168183" conceptname="Synovitis">synovitis</span> of active rheumatoid disease.

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE
</h1>
<p class="First">Gold Sodium Thiomalate is indicated in the treatment of selected cases of active rheumatoid arthritisâ€”both adult and juvenile type. The greatest benefit occurs in the early active stage. In late stages of the illness when cartilage and bone damage have occurred, gold can only check the progression of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> and prevent further structural damage to joints. It cannot repair damage caused by previously active disease.
</p>
<p>Gold Sodium Thiomalate should be used only as <span class="Italics">one part</span> of a complete program of therapy; alone it is not a complete treatment.

<h3>Pregnancy Category C.
</h3>
<p class="First">Gold Sodium Thiomalate has been shown to be teratogenic during the organogenetic period in rats and rabbits when given in doses, respectively, of 140 and 175 times the usual human dose. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4043738" conceptname="Hydrocephalus">Hydrocephaly</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="376512" conceptname="Microphthalmos">microphthalmia</span> were the malformations observed in rats when Gold Sodium Thiomalate was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 25 mg/kg/day from day 6 through day 15 of gestation.

<h2>Nursing Mothers
</h2>
<p class="First">The presence of gold has been demonstrated in the milk of lactating mothers. In addition, gold has been found in the serum and red blood cells of a nursing infant. In view of the above findings and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Gold Sodium Thiomalate, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. The slow excretion and persistence of gold in the mother, even after therapy is discontinued, must also be kept in mind.

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS
</h1>
<p class="First">A variety of adverse reactions may develop during the initial phase (weekly injections) of therapy or during maintenance treatment. Adverse reactions are observed most frequently when the cumulative dose of Gold Sodium Thiomalate administered is between 400 and 800 mg. Very uncommonly, complications occur days to months after cessation of treatment.

<h1>MANAGEMENT OF ADVERSE REACTIONS
</h1>
<p class="First">Treatment with Gold Sodium Thiomalate should be discontinued immediately when toxic reactions occur. Minor complications such as localized <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133835" conceptname="Eczema">dermatitis</span>, mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138455" conceptname="Stomatitis">stomatitis</span>, or slight <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75650" conceptname="Proteinuria">proteinuria</span> generally require no other therapy and resolve spontaneously with suspension of Gold Sodium Thiomalate. Moderately severe skin and mucous membrane reactions often benefit from topical corticosteroids, oral antihistaminics, and soothing or anesthetic lotions.
</p>
<p>If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138455" conceptname="Stomatitis">stomatitis</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133835" conceptname="Eczema">dermatitis</span> becomes severe or more generalized, systemic corticosteroids (generally, prednisone 10 to 40 mg daily in divided doses) may provide symptomatic relief.
</p>
<p>For serious renal, hematologic, pulmonary, and enterocolitic complications, high doses of systemic corticosteroids (prednisone 40 to 100 mg daily in divided doses) are recommended. The optimum duration of corticosteroid treatment varies with the response of the individual patient. Therapy may be required for many months when adverse effects are unusually severe or progressive.
</p>
<p>In patients whose complications do not improve with high-dose corticosteroid treatment, or who develop significant steroid-related adverse reactions, a chelating agent may be given to enhance gold excretion. Dimercaprol (BAL) has been used successfully, but patients must be monitored carefully as numerous untoward reactions may attend its use. Corticosteroids and a chelating agent may be used concomitantly.
</p>
<p>Gold Sodium Thiomalate <span class="Bold">should not be reinstituted after severe or idiosyncratic reactions.</span></p>
<p>Gold Sodium Thiomalate may be readministered following resolution of mild reactions, using a reduced dosage schedule. If an initial test dose of 5 mg Gold Sodium Thiomalate is well- tolerated, progressively larger doses (5 to 10 mg increments) may be given at weekly to monthly intervals until a dose of 25 to 50 mg is reached.

<a name="s22"></a><a name="section-10"></a><p></p>
<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</h1>
<p class="First">Gold Sodium Thiomalate should be administered only by intramuscular injection, preferably intragluteally. It should be given with the patient lying down. He should remain recumbent for approximately 10 minutes after the injection.
</p>
<p>Therapeutic effects from Gold Sodium Thiomalate occur slowly. Early improvement, often limited to a reduction in morning <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4060220" conceptname="Stiff neck">stiffness</span>, may begin after six to eight weeks of treatment, but beneficial effects may not be observed until after months of therapy.

<p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use if material has darkened.

<p>For the adult of average size the following dosage schedule is suggested:

</p>
<p>3rd and sub sequent injections, 25 to 50 mg until there is toxicity or major clinical improvement, or, in the absence of either of these, the cumulative dose of Gold Sodium Thiomalate reaches one gram.
</p>
<p>Gold Sodium Thiomalate is continued until the cumulative dose reaches one gram unless toxicity or major clinical improvement occurs. If significant clinical improvement occurs before a cumulative dose of one gram has been administered, the dose may be decreased or the interval between injections increased as with maintenance therapy. Maintenance doses of 25 to 50 mg every other week for two to 20 weeks are recommended. If the clinical course remains stable, injections of 25 to 50 mg may be given every third and subsequently every fourth week indefinitely. Some patients may require maintenance treatment at intervals of one to three weeks. Should the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4291025" conceptname="Arthritis">arthritis</span> exacerbate during maintenance therapy, weekly injections may be resumed temporarily until disease activity is suppressed.
</p>
<p>Should a patient fail to improve during initial therapy (cumulative dose of one gram), several options are available.
</p>
<ol class="Arabic">
<li>the patient may be considered to be unresponsive and Gold Sodium Thiomalate is discontinued.
</li>
<li>the same dose (25 to 50 mg) of Gold Sodium Thiomalate may be continued for approximately ten additional weeks.
</li>
<li>the dose of Gold Sodium Thiomalate may be increased by increments of 10 mg every one to four weeks, not to exceed 100 mg in single injection.
</li>
</ol>
<p>If significant clinical improvement occurs using option 2 or 3, the maintenance schedule described above should be initiated. If there is no significant improvement or if toxicity occurs, therapy with Gold Sodium Thiomalate should be stopped. The higher the individual dose of Gold Sodium Thiomalate, the greater the risk of gold toxicity. Selection of one of these options for chrysotherapy should be based upon a number of factors, including the physician's experience with gold salt therapy, the course of the patient's condition, the choice of alternative treatments, and the availability of the patient for the close supervision required.
