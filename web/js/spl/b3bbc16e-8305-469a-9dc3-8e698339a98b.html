<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Penile erection is a hemodynamic process initiated by the relaxation of smooth muscle in the corpus cavernosum and its associated arterioles. During sexual stimulation, nitric oxide is released from nerve endings and endothelial cells in the corpus cavernosum. Nitric oxide activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase resulting in increased synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the smooth muscle cells of the corpus cavernosum. The cGMP in turn triggers smooth <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">muscle relaxation</span>, allowing increased blood flow into the penis, resulting in erection. The tissue concentration of cGMP is regulated by both the rates of synthesis and degradation via phosphodiesterases (PDEs). The most abundant PDE in the human corpus cavernosum is the cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5); therefore, the inhibition of PDE5 enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP. Because sexual stimulation is required to initiate the local release of nitric oxide, the inhibition of PDE5 has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies have shown that vardenafil is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. The inhibitory effect of vardenafil is more selective on PDE5 than for other known phosphodiesterases (&gt;15-fold relative to PDE6, &gt;130-fold relative to PDE1, &gt;300-fold relative to PDE11, and &gt;1,000-fold relative to PDE2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, and 10).</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of vardenafil are approximately dose proportional over the recommended dose range. Vardenafil is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism, mainly by CYP3A4 and to a minor extent, CYP2C isoforms. Concomitant use with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ritonavir, indinavir, ketoconazole, as well as moderate CYP3A inhibitors such as erythromycin results in significant increases of plasma levels of vardenafil (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_precautions_id_pre">PRECAUTIONS</a>, <a href="#i4i_warnings_id_warnings">WARNINGS</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_dosadmin">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>). Mean vardenafil plasma concentrations measured after the administration of a single oral dose of 20 mg to healthy male volunteers are depicted in Figure 1.</p>

<h3>Absorption:</h3>
<p class="First">Vardenafil is rapidly absorbed with absolute bioavailability of approximately 15%. Maximum observed plasma concentrations after a single 20 mg dose in healthy volunteers are usually reached between 30 minutes and 2 hours (median 60 minutes) after oral dosing in the fasted state. Two food-effect studies were conducted which showed that high-fat meals caused a reduction in C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 18%-50%.</p>

<h3>Distribution:</h3>
<p class="First">The mean steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) for vardenafil is 208 L, indicating extensive tissue distribution. Vardenafil and its major circulating metabolite, M1, are highly bound to plasma proteins (about 95% for parent drug and M1). This protein binding is reversible and independent of total drug concentrations.</p>
<p>Following a single oral dose of 20 mg vardenafil in healthy volunteers, a mean of 0.00018% of the administered dose was obtained in semen 1.5 hours after dosing.</p>

<h3>Metabolism:</h3>
<p class="First">Vardenafil is metabolized predominantly by the hepatic enzyme CYP3A4, with contribution from the CYP3A5 and CYP2C isoforms. The major circulating metabolite, M1, results from desethylation at the piperazine moiety of vardenafil. M1 is subject to further metabolism. The plasma concentration of M1 is approximately 26% that of the parent compound. This metabolite shows a phosphodiesterase selectivity profile similar to that of vardenafil and an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> inhibitory potency for PDE5 28% of that of vardenafil. Therefore, M1 accounts for approximately 7% of total pharmacologic activity.</p>

<h3>Excretion:</h3>
<p class="First">The total body clearance of vardenafil is 56 L/h, and the terminal half-life of vardenafil and its primary metabolite (M1) is approximately 4-5 hours. After oral administration, vardenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (approximately 91-95% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 2-6% of administered oral dose).</p>

<h3>Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations</h3>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pediatrics:</span> Vardenafil trials were not conducted in the pediatric population.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Geriatrics:</span> In a healthy volunteer study of elderly males (â‰¥65 years) and younger males (18â€“45 years), mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC were 34% and 52% higher, respectively, in the elderly males (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>, <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_geriatric_use_id_preger">Geriatric Use</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_dosadmin">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>). Consequently, a lower starting dose of LEVITRA (5 mg) in patients â‰¥65 years of age should be considered.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span>:</span> In volunteers with mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (CL<span class="Sub">cr</span> = 50-80 ml/min), the pharmacokinetics of vardenafil were similar to those observed in a control group with normal renal function. In the moderate (CL<span class="Sub">cr</span> = 30-50 ml/min) or severe (CL<span class="Sub">cr</span>&lt;30 ml/min) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> groups, the AUC of vardenafil was 20â€“30% higher compared to that observed in a control group with normal renal function (CL<span class="Sub">cr</span>&gt;80 ml/min). Vardenafil pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated in patients requiring renal dialysis (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>, <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_section_id_8145cefa-b174-4211-90ad-935fe083828c"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span></a>,</span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_dosadmin">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>

In volunteers with moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> (Child-Pugh B), the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC following a 10 mg vardenafil dose were increased by 130% and 160%, respectively, compared to healthy control subjects. Consequently, a starting dose of 5 mg is recommended for patients with moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>, and the maximum dose should not exceed 10 mg (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_precautions_id_pre">PRECAUTIONS</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_dosadmin">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).

<h3>Effects on Blood Pressure: </h3>
<p class="First">In a clinical pharmacology study of patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">erectile dysfunction</span>, single doses of vardenafil 20 mg caused a mean maximum decrease in supine blood pressure of 7 mmHg systolic and 8 mmHg diastolic (compared to placebo), accompanied by a mean maximum increase of heart rate of 4 beats per minute. The maximum decrease in blood pressure occurred between 1 and 4 hours after dosing. Following multiple dosing for 31 days, similar blood pressure responses were observed on Day 31 as on Day 1. Vardenafil may add to the blood pressure lowering effects of antihypertensive agents (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>, <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_interactions_id_predi">Drug Interactions</a></span>).</p>

<h3>Effects on Blood Pressure and Heart Rate when LEVITRA is Combined with Nitrates: </h3>
<p class="First">A study was conducted in which the blood pressure and heart rate response to 0.4 mg nitroglycerin (NTG) sublingually was evaluated in 18 healthy subjects following pretreatment with LEVITRA 20 mg at various times before NTG administration. LEVITRA 20 mg caused an additional time-related reduction in blood pressure and increase in heart rate in association with NTG administration. The blood pressure effects were observed when LEVITRA 20 mg was dosed 1 or 4 hours before NTG and the heart rate effects were observed when 20 mg was dosed 1, 4, or 8 hours before NTG. Additional blood pressure and heart rate changes were not detected when LEVITRA 20 mg was dosed 24 hours before NTG. (See <a href="#id_88b04fff-a419-44eb-85c2-9cd22ce841f3">Figure 2</a>.)</p>
<div class="Figure">
<img alt="Figure 2" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=b3bbc16e-8305-469a-9dc3-8e698339a98b&amp;name=bfc7a65d-372d-4748-8bb9-c5467a87207c-03.jpg"><p class="MultiMediaCaption">Figure 2: Placebo-subtracted point estimates (with 90% CI) of mean maximal blood pressure and heart rate effects of pre-dosing with LEVITRA 20 mg at 24, 8, 4, and 1 hour before 0.4 mg NTG sublingually. </p>
</div>
<p>Because the disease state of patients requiring nitrate therapy is anticipated to increase the likelihood of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, the use of vardenafil by patients on nitrate therapy or on nitric oxide donors is contraindicated (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_contraindications_id_contra">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span>).</p>

<h3>Electrophysiology:</h3>
<p class="First">The effect of 10 mg and 80 mg vardenafil on QT interval was evaluated in a single-dose, double-blind, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) crossover study in 59 healthy males (81% White, 12% Black, 7% Hispanic) aged 45-60 years. The QT interval was measured at one hour post dose because this time point approximates the average time of peak vardenafil concentration. The 80 mg dose of LEVITRA (four times the highest recommended dose) was chosen because this dose yields plasma concentrations covering those observed upon co-administration of a low-dose of LEVITRA (5 mg) and 600 mg BID of ritonavir. Of the CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been studied, ritonavir causes the most significant drug-drug interaction with vardenafil. Table 1 summarizes the effect on mean uncorrected QT and mean corrected QT interval (QT<span class="Sub">c</span>) with different methods of correction (Fridericia and a linear individual correction method) at one hour post-dose. No single correction method is known to be more valid than the other. In this study, the mean increase in heart rate associated with a 10 mg dose of LEVITRA compared to placebo was 5 beats/minute and with an 80 mg dose of LEVITRA the mean increase was 6 beats/minute.</p>

<p>Therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses of vardenafil and the active control moxifloxacin produced similar increases in QT<span class="Sub">c</span> interval. This study, however, was not designed to make direct statistical comparisons between the drug or the dose levels. The clinical impact of these QT<span class="Sub">c</span> changes is unknown (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_precautions_id_pre">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>).</p>
<p>In a separate postmarketing study of 44 healthy volunteers, single doses of 10 mg LEVITRA resulted in a placebo-subtracted mean change from baseline of QTcF (Fridericia correction) of 5 msec (90% CI: 2,8). Single doses of gatifloxacin 400mg resulted in a placebo-subtracted mean change from baseline QTcF of 4 msec (90% CI: 1,7). When LEVITRA 10mg and gatifloxacin 400 mg were co-administered, the mean QTcF change from baseline was additive when compared to either drug alone and produced a mean QTcF change of 9 msec from baseline (90% CI: 6,11). The clinical impact of these QT changes is unknown (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_precautions_id_pre">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>, <a href="#i4i_precautions_id_pre">Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation</a>).</p>

<h3>Effects on Exercise Treadmill Test in Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317576" conceptname="Coronary arteriosclerosis">Coronary Artery Disease</span> (CAD):</h3>
<p class="First">In two independent trials that assessed 10 mg (n=41) and 20 mg (n=39) vardenafil, respectively, vardenafil did not alter the total treadmill exercise time compared to placebo. The patient population included men aged 40-80 years with stable exercise-induced angina documented by at least one of the following: 1) prior history of MI, CABG, PTCA, or stenting (not within 6 months); 2) positive coronary angiogram showing at least 60% narrowing of the diameter of at least one major coronary artery; or 3) a positive stress echocardiogram or stress nuclear perfusion study.</p>
<p>Results of these studies showed that LEVITRA did not alter the total treadmill exercise time compared to placebo (10 mg LEVITRA vs. placebo: 433Â±109 and 426Â±105 seconds, respectively; 20 mg LEVITRA vs. placebo: 414Â±114 and 411Â±124 seconds, respectively). The total time to angina was not altered by LEVITRA when compared to placebo (10 mg LEVITRA vs. placebo: 291Â±123 and 292Â±110 seconds; 20 mg LEVITRA vs. placebo: 354Â±137 and 347Â±143 seconds, respectively). The total time to 1 mm or greater ST-segment <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> was similar to placebo in both the 10 mg and the 20 mg LEVITRA groups (10 mg LEVITRA vs. placebo: 380Â±108 and 334Â±108 seconds; 20 mg LEVITRA vs. placebo: 364Â±101 and 366Â±105 seconds, respectively).</p>

<h3>Effects on Vision:</h3>
<p class="First">Single oral doses of phosphodiesterase inhibitors have demonstrated transient dose-related impairment of color discrimination (blue/green) using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test and reductions in electroretinogram (ERG) b-wave amplitudes, with peak effects near the time of peak plasma levels. These findings are consistent with the inhibition of PDE6 in rods and cones, which is involved in phototransduction in the retina. The findings were most evident one hour after administration, diminishing but still present 6 hours after administration. In a single dose study in 25 normal males, LEVITRA 40 mg, twice the maximum daily recommended dose, did not alter visual acuity, intraocular pressure, fundoscopic and slit lamp findings.</p>
<p>In another double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial, at least 15 doses of 20 mg vardenafil were administered over 8 weeks versus placebo to 52 males. Thirty-two (32) males (62%) of the patients completed the trial. Retinal function was measured by ERG and FM-100 test 2, 6 and 24 hours after dosing. The trial was designed to detect changes in retinal function that might occur in more than 10% of patients. Vardenafil did not produce clinically significant ERG or FM-100 effects in healthy men compared to placebo. Two patients on vardenafil in the trial reported episodes of transient cyanopsia (objects appear blue).</p>

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First">LEVITRA was evaluated in four major double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose, parallel design, multicenter trials in 2431 men aged 20-83 (mean age 57 years; 78% White, 7% Black, 2% Asian, 3% Hispanic and 10% Other/Unknown). The doses of LEVITRA in these studies were 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg. Two of these trials were conducted in the general ED population and two in special ED populations (one in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus and one in post-prostatectomy patients). LEVITRA was dosed without regard to meals on an as needed basis in men with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">erectile dysfunction</span> (ED), many of whom had multiple other medical conditions. The primary endpoints were assessed at 3 months.</p>
<p>Primary efficacy assessment in all four major trials was by means of the Erectile Function (EF) Domain score of the validated International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Questionnaire and two questions from the Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) dealing with the ability to achieve vaginal penetration (SEP2), and the ability to maintain an erection long enough for successful intercourse (SEP3).</p>
<p>In all four fixed-dose efficacy trials, LEVITRA showed clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in the EF Domain, SEP2, and SEP3 scores compared to placebo. The mean baseline EF Domain score in these trials was 11.8 (scores range from 0-30 where lower scores represent more severe disease).

<h2>Cardiovascular effects</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">General:</span> Physicians should consider the cardiovascular status of their patients, since there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity. In men for whom sexual activity is not recommended because of their underlying cardiovascular status, any treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">erectile dysfunction</span>, including LEVITRA, generally should not be used.</p>

<p><span class="Italics">Blood Pressure Effects:</span> LEVITRA has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 7 mmHg systolic and 8 mmHg diastolic) (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>, <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_pharmacodynamics_id_clinpharmdy">Pharmacodynamics</a></span>). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing LEVITRA, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects.</p>

<h2>Effect of Co-administration of Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors </h2>
<p class="First">Long-term safety information is not available on the concomitant administration of vardenafil with HIV protease inhibitors. Concomitant administration with ritonavir or indinavir substantially increases plasma concentrations of vardenafil. Because ritonavir prolongs LEVITRA elimination half-life (5 to 6-fold), no more than a single 2.5 mg dose of LEVITRA should be taken in a 72-hour period by patients also taking ritonavir. Patients taking indinavir, saquinavir, atazanavir or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as clarithromycin, ketoconazole 400 mg daily, or itraconazole 400 mg daily should not exceed a dose of LEVITRA 2.5 mg once daily. For patients taking ketoconazole 200 mg daily or itraconazole 200 mg daily, a single dose of 5 mg LEVITRA should not be exceeded in a 24-hour period (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>,<span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_interactions_id_predi">Drug Interactions</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_dosadmin">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">The evaluation of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">erectile dysfunction</span> should include a determination of potential underlying causes, a medical assessment, and the identification of appropriate treatment. </p>
<p>Before prescribing LEVITRA, it is important to note the following:</p>

<h2>Alpha-blockers: </h2>
<p class="First">Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, including LEVITRA, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>,<a href="#i4i_interactions_id_predi"></a><span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_interactions_id_predi">Drug Interactions</a></span>) leading to symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">fainting</span>). Consideration should be given to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4311860" conceptname="Hemodynamic instability">hemodynamic instability</span> on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors.</li>
<li>In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest recommended starting dose (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_dosadmin">DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION</a></span>). </li>
<li>In those patients already taking an optimized dose of PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. Stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure in patients taking a PDE5 inhibitor.</li>
<li>Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436375" conceptname="Hypovolemia">volume depletion</span> and other anti-hypertensive drugs.</li>

<p class="First">In volunteers with moderate impairment (Child-Pugh B), the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC following a 10 mg vardenafil dose were increased 130% and 160%, respectively, compared to healthy control subjects. Consequently, a starting dose of 5 mg is recommended for patients with moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> and the maximum dose should not exceed 10 mg (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>,<a href="#i4i_section_id_clinpharmcosp"></a><span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_section_id_clinpharmcosp">Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations</a>,</span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_dosadmin">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>). Vardenafil has not been evaluated in patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> (Child-Pugh C).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation:</span> In a study of the effect of LEVITRA on QT interval in 59 healthy males (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>,<span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_section_id_21f1f75e-dce4-4eaa-a09f-98fa31049fcd">Electrophysiology</a></span>), therapeutic (10 mg) and supratherapeutic (80 mg) doses of LEVITRA and the active control moxifloxacin (400 mg) produced similar increases in QT<span class="Sub">c</span> interval. A postmarketing study evaluating the effect of combining LEVITRA with another drug of comparable QT effect showed an additive QT effect when compared with either drug alone (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>,<span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_section_id_21f1f75e-dce4-4eaa-a09f-98fa31049fcd">Electrophysiology</a></span>). These observations should be considered in clinical decisions when prescribing LEVITRA to patients with known history of QT prolongation or patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval. Patients taking Class 1A (e.g. quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications or those with congenital QT prolongation, should avoid using LEVITRA.</p>

Patients should be advised to contact the prescribing physician if other anti-hypertensive drugs or new medications that may interact with LEVITRA are prescribed by another healthcare provider.</p>
<p>Physicians should discuss with patients the appropriate use of LEVITRA and its anticipated benefits. It should be explained that sexual stimulation is required for an erection to occur after taking LEVITRA. LEVITRA should be taken approximately 60 minutes before sexual activity. Patients should be counseled regarding the dosing of LEVITRA. Patients should be advised to contact their healthcare provider for dose modification if they are not satisfied with the quality of their sexual performance with LEVITRA or in the case of an unwanted effect. Patients should be advised to contact the prescribing physician if new medications that may interact with LEVITRA are prescribed by another healthcare provider.</p>

Therefore, inhibitors of these enzymes are expected to reduce vardenafil clearance (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_warnings_id_warnings">WARNINGS</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_dosadmin">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vivo studies: Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors</span></p>
<p>Cimetidine (400 mg b.i.d.) had no effect on vardenafil bioavailability (AUC) and maximum concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of vardenafil when co-administered with 20 mg LEVITRA in healthy volunteers.</p>
<p>Erythromycin (500 mg t.i.d.) produced a 4-fold increase in vardenafil AUC and a 3-fold increase in C<span class="Sub">max</span> when co-administered with LEVITRA 5 mg in healthy volunteers (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_dosadmin">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>). It is recommended not to exceed a single 5 mg dose of LEVITRA in a 24-hour period when used in combination with erythromycin.</p>
<p>Ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) produced a 10-fold increase in vardenafil AUC and a 4-fold increase in C<span class="Sub">max</span> when co-administered with LEVITRA (5 mg) in healthy volunteers. A 5-mg LEVITRA dose should not be exceeded when used in combination with 200 mg once daily ketoconazole. Since higher doses of ketoconazole (400 mg daily) may result in higher increases in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC, a single 2.5 mg dose of LEVITRA should not be exceeded in a 24-hour period when used in combination with ketoconazole 400 mg daily (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_warnings_id_warnings">WARNINGS</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_dosadmin">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>
<p><span class="Italics">HIV Protease Inhibitors:</span></p>
<p>Indinavir (800 mg t.i.d.) co-administered with LEVITRA 10 mg resulted in a 16-fold increase in vardenafil AUC, a 7-fold increase in vardenafil C<span class="Sub">max</span> and a 2-fold increase in vardenafil half-life. It is recommended not to exceed a single 2.5 mg LEVITRA dose in a 24-hour period when used in combination with indinavir (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_warnings_id_warnings">WARNINGS</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_dosadmin">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>
<p>Ritonavir (600 mg b.i.d.) co-administered with LEVITRA 5 mg resulted in a 49-fold increase in vardenafil AUC and a 13-fold increase in vardenafil C<span class="Sub">max</span>. The interaction is a consequence of blocking hepatic metabolism of vardenafil by ritonavir, a highly potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, which also inhibits CYP2C9. Ritonavir significantly prolonged the half-life of vardenafil to 26 hours. Consequently, it is recommended not to exceed a single 2.5 mg LEVITRA dose in a 72-hour period when used in combination with ritonavir (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_warnings_id_warnings">WARNINGS</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_dosadmin">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Other CYP3A4 inhibitors</span>: Although specific interactions have not been studied, other CYP3A4 inhibitors, including grapefruit juice would likely increase vardenafil exposure.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Other Drug Interactions:</span> No <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interactions</span> were observed between vardenafil and the following drugs: glyburide, warfarin, digoxin, Maalox, and ranitidine. In the warfarin study, vardenafil had no effect on the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time or other pharmacodynamic parameters.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Effects of LEVITRA on other drugs</span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vitro studies:</span></p>
<p>Vardenafil and its metabolites had no effect on CYP1A2, 2A6, and 2E1 (Ki &gt;100 ÂµM). Weak inhibitory effects toward other isoforms (CYP2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4) were found, but Ki values were in excess of plasma concentrations achieved following dosing. The most potent inhibitory activity was observed for vardenafil metabolite M1, which had a Ki of 1.4 ÂµM toward CYP3A4, which is about 20 times higher than the M1 C<span class="Sub">max</span> values after an 80 mg LEVITRA dose.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vivo studies:</span></p>
<p>Nitrates: The blood pressure lowering effects of sublingual nitrates (0.4 mg) taken 1 and 4 hours after vardenafil and increases in heart rate when taken at 1, 4 and 8 hours were potentiated by a 20 mg dose of LEVITRA in healthy middle-aged subjects. These effects were not observed when LEVITRA 20 mg was taken 24 hours before the NTG. Potentiation of the hypotensive effects of nitrates for patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4124683" conceptname="Silent myocardial ischemia">ischemic heart disease</span> has not been evaluated, and concomitant use of LEVITRA and nitrates is contraindicated (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacodynamics,</span><a href="#i4i_section_id_2d3f57c1-8b56-481c-8336-822c1fc31192">Effects on Blood Pressure and Heart Rate when LEVITRA is Combined with Nitrates</a>;<a href="#i4i_contraindications_id_contra">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>).</p>
<p>Nifedipine: Vardenafil 20 mg, when co-administered with slow-release nifedipine 30 mg or 60 mg once daily, did not affect the relative bioavailability (AUC) or maximum concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of nifedipine, a drug that is metabolized via CYP3A4. Nifedipine did not alter the plasma levels of LEVITRA when taken in combination. In these patients whose <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> was controlled with nifedipine, LEVITRA 20 mg produced mean additional supine systolic/diastolic blood pressure reductions of 6/5 mmHg compared to placebo.</p>

<p>Concomitant treatment with vardenafil and alpha-blockers should be initiated only if the patient is stable on his alpha-blocker therapy.

<p><span class="Underline">Blood pressure effects in normotensive men after forced titration with alpha-blockers:</span></p>
<p>Two randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical pharmacology studies with healthy normotensive volunteers (age range, 45-74 years) were performed after forced titration of the alpha-blocker terazosin to 10 mg daily over 14 days (n=29), and after initiation of tamsulosin 0.4 mg daily for five days (n=24). There were no severe adverse events related to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> in either study.

Instances of outlier blood pressure values (defined as standing SBP &lt;85 mmHg and/or a decrease from baseline of standing SBP &gt;30 mmHg) were observed in 9/24 subjects receiving tamsulosin and 19/29 receiving terazosin. The incidence of subjects with standing SBP &lt;85 mmHg given vardenafil and terazosin to achieve simultaneous T<span class="Sub">max</span> led to early termination of that arm of the study.

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Vardenafil was not carcinogenic in rats and mice when administered daily for 24 months. In these studies systemic drug exposures (AUCs) for unbound (free) vardenafil and its major metabolite were approximately 400- and 170-fold for male and female rats, respectively, and 21- and 37-fold for male and female mice, respectively, the exposures observed in human males given the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 20 mg. Vardenafil was not mutagenic as assessed in either the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> bacterial Ames assay or the forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster V<span class="Sub">79</span> cells. Vardenafil was not clastogenic as assessed in either the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> chromosomal aberration test or the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus test. Vardenafil did not impair fertility in male and female rats administered doses up to 100 mg/kg/day for 28 days prior to mating in male, and for 14 days prior to mating and through day 7 of gestation in females. In a corresponding 1-month rat toxicity study, this dose produced an AUC value for unbound vardenafil 200 fold greater than AUC in humans at the MRHD of 20 mg.</p>
<p>There was no effect on sperm motility or morphology after single 20 mg oral doses of vardenafil in healthy volunteers.</p>

<p class="First">LEVITRA is not indicated for use in women, newborns, or children. Vardenafil was secreted into the milk of lactating rats at concentrations approximately 10-fold greater than found in the plasma. Following a single oral dose of 3 mg/kg, 3.3% of the administered dose was excreted into the milk within 24 hours. It is not known if vardenafil is excreted in human breast milk.</p>

<h2>Pregnancy Category B:</h2>
<p class="First"> No evidence of specific potential for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span>, embryotoxicity or fetotoxicity was observed in rats and rabbits that received vardenafil at up to 18 mg/kg/day during organogenesis. This dose is approximately 100 fold (rat) and 29 fold (rabbit) greater than the AUC values for unbound vardenafil and its major metabolite in humans given the MRHD of 20 mg. In the rat pre-and postnatal development study, the NOAEL (no observed adverse effect level) for maternal toxicity was 8 mg/kg/day. Retarded physical development of pups in the absence of maternal effects was observed following maternal exposure to 1 and 8 mg/kg possibly due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4237053" conceptname="Vasodilatation">vasodilatation</span> and/or secretion of the drug into milk. The number of living pups born to rats exposed pre- and postnatally was reduced at 60 mg/kg/day. Based on the results of the pre- and postnatal study, the developmental NOAEL is less than 1 mg/kg/day. Based on plasma exposures in the rat developmental toxicity study, 1 mg/kg/day in the pregnant rat is estimated to produce total AUC values for unbound vardenafil and its major metabolite comparable to the human AUC at the MRHD of 20 mg. There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of vardenafil in pregnant women.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Elderly males age 65 years and older have higher vardenafil plasma concentrations than younger males (18 â€“ 45 years), mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC were 34% and 52% higher, respectively (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>,<a href="#i4i_section_id_clinpharmcosp"></a><span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_section_id_clinpharmcosp">Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations</a>,</span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_dosadmin">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>). Phase 3 clinical trials included more than 834 elderly patients, and no differences in safety or effectiveness of LEVITRA 5, 10, or 20 mg were noted when these elderly patients were compared to younger patients. However, due to increased vardenafil concentrations in the elderly, a starting dose of 5 mg LEVITRA should be considered in patients â‰¥65 years of age.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">LEVITRA was administered to over 4430 men (mean age 56, range 18-89 years; 81% White, 6% Black, 2% Asian, 2% Hispanic and 9% Other) during controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials worldwide. Over 2200 patients were treated for 6 months or longer, and 880 patients were treated for at least 1 year.</p>
<p>In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the discontinuation rate due to adverse events was 3.4% for LEVITRA compared to 1.1% for placebo. </p>
<p>When LEVITRA was taken as recommended in placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse events were reported (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#table5">Table 5</a></span>).</p>

For ketoconazole 200 mg daily, itraconazole 200 mg daily, and erythromycin, a single dose of 5 mg LEVITRA should not be exceeded in a 24-hour period. For alpha-blockers, caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors, including LEVITRA, are used concomitantly with alpha-blockers because of the potential for an additive effect on blood pressure. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>,<span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_section_id_68254578-48a2-41bb-bd69-f49bacd55a1f">Alpha-blockers </a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_interactions_id_predi">Drug Interactions</a></span>) leading to symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">fainting</span>). Concomitant treatment should be initiated only if the patient is stable on his alpha blocker therapy. In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, LEVITRA should be initiated at a dose of 5 mg (2.5 mg when used concomitantly with certain CYP3A4 inhibitors - see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_interactions_id_predi">Drug Interactions</a></span>).</p>

<p>Read the Patient Information about LEVITRA before you start taking it and again each time you get a refill. There may be new information. You may also find it helpful to share this information with your partner. This leaflet does not take the place of talking with your doctor. You and your doctor should talk about LEVITRA when you start taking it and at regular checkups. If you do not understand the information, or have questions, talk with your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">WHAT IMPORTANT INFORMATION SHOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT LEVITRA?</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">LEVITRA can cause your blood pressure to drop suddenly to an unsafe level if it is taken with certain other medicines.</span> With a sudden <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314171" conceptname="Low blood pressure reading">drop in blood pressure</span>, you could get dizzy, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">faint</span>, or have a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Do not take LEVITRA if you:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="Bold">take any medicines called â€œnitrates.â€?</span></li>
<li><span class="Bold">use recreational drugs called â€œpoppersâ€? like amyl nitrate and butyl nitrate.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>(See "<span class="Bold">Who Should Not Take Levitra?</span>")</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Tell all your healthcare providers that you take LEVITRA.</span> If you need emergency medical care for a heart problem, it will be important for your healthcare provider to know when you last took LEVITRA.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">WHAT IS LEVITRA?</span></p>
<p>LEVITRA is a prescription medicine taken by mouth for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">erectile dysfunction</span> (ED) in men. </p>
<p>ED is a condition where the penis does not harden and expand when a man is sexually excited, or when he cannot keep an erection. A man who has trouble getting or keeping an erection should see his doctor for help if the condition bothers him. LEVITRA may help a man with ED get and keep an erection when he is sexually excited.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">LEVITRA does not:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>cure ED</li>
<li>increase a manâ€™s sexual desire</li>
<li>protect a man or his partner from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440647" conceptname="Sexually transmitted infectious disease">sexually transmitted diseases</span>, including HIV. Speak to your doctor about ways to guard against <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440647" conceptname="Sexually transmitted infectious disease">sexually transmitted diseases</span>.</li>
<li>serve as a male form of birth control </li>
</ul>
<p>LEVITRA is only for men with ED. LEVITRA is not for women or children. LEVITRA must be used only under a doctorâ€™s care.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">HOW DOES LEVITRA WORK?</span></p>
<p>When a man is sexually stimulated, his bodyâ€™s normal physical response is to increase blood flow to his penis. This results in an erection. LEVITRA helps increase blood flow to the penis and may help men with ED get and keep an erection satisfactory for sexual activity. Once a man has completed sexual activity, blood flow to his penis decreases, and his erection goes away.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">WHO CAN TAKE LEVITRA?</span></p>
<p>Talk to your doctor to decide if LEVITRA is right for you.</p>
<p>LEVITRA has been shown to be effective in men over the age of 18 years who have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">erectile dysfunction</span>, including men with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> or who have undergone prostatectomy.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE LEVITRA?</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Do not take LEVITRA if you:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="Bold">take any medicines called â€œnitratesâ€?</span> (See â€œ<span class="Bold">What important information should you know about LEVITRA?</span>â€?).

Angina is a symptom of heart disease and can cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> in your chest, jaw, or down your arm.<br>Medicines called nitrates include nitroglycerin that is found in tablets, sprays, ointments, pastes, or patches. Nitrates can also be found in other medicines such as isosorbide dinitrate or isosorbide mononitrate. Some recreational drugs called â€œpoppersâ€? also contain nitrates, such as amyl nitrate and butyl nitrate. Do not use LEVITRA if you are using these drugs. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure if any of your medicines are nitrates.</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">you have been told by your healthcare provider to not have sexual activity because of health problems.</span> Sexual activity can put an extra <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span> on your heart, especially if your heart is already weak from a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</span> or heart disease.</li>

<p><span class="Bold">CAN OTHER MEDICATIONS AFFECT LEVITRA?</span></p>
<p>Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. LEVITRA and other medicines may affect each other. Always check with your doctor before starting or stopping any medicines. Especially tell your doctor if you take any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>medicines called nitrates (See â€œ<span class="Bold">What important information should you know about LEVITRA?</span>â€?)</li>
<li>medicines called alpha-blockers. These include Hytrin<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (terazosin HCl), Flomax<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (tamsulosin HCl), Cardura<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (doxazosin mesylate), Minipress<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (prazosin HCl) or Uroxatral<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (alfuzosin HCl). Alpha-blockers are sometimes prescribed for prostate problems or high blood pressure. In some patients the use of PDE5 inhibitor drugs, including LEVITRA, with alpha-blockers can lower blood pressure significantly leading to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">fainting</span>. You should contact the prescribing physician if alpha-blockers or other drugs that lower blood pressure are prescribed by another healthcare provider. </li>
<li>medicines that treat abnormal heartbeat. These include quinidine, procainamide, amiodarone and sotalol.</li>
<li>ritonavir (Norvir<span class="Sup">Â®</span>) or indinavir sulfate (Crixivan<span class="Sup">Â®</span>) saquinavir (Fortavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> or Invirase<span class="Sup">Â®</span>) or atazanavir (Reyataz<span class="Sup">Â®</span>)</li>
<li>ketoconazole or itraconazole (such as Nizoral<span class="Sup">Â®</span> or Sporanox<span class="Sup">Â®</span>)</li>
<li>erythromycin or clarithromycin</li>
<li>other medicines or treatments for ED</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Bold">HOW SHOULD YOU TAKE LEVITRA? </span></p>
<p>Take LEVITRA exactly as your doctor prescribes. LEVITRA comes in different doses (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg). For most men, the recommended starting dose is 10 mg. <span class="Bold">Take LEVITRA no more than once a day.</span> Doses should be taken at least 24 hours apart. Some men can only take a low dose of LEVITRA because of medical conditions or medicines they take. Your doctor will prescribe the dose that is right for you.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are older than 65 or have liver problems, your doctor may start you on a lower dose of LEVITRA.</li>
<li>If you have prostate problems or high blood pressure, for which you take medicines called alpha-blockers, your doctor may start you on a lower dose of LEVITRA.</li>
<li>If you are taking certain other medicines your doctor may prescribe a lower starting dose and limit you to one dose of LEVITRA in a 72-hour (3 days) period.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take 1 LEVITRA tablet about 1 hour (60 minutes) before sexual activity. Some form of sexual stimulation is needed for an erection to happen with LEVITRA. LEVITRA may be taken with or without meals. </p>
<p>Do not change your dose of LEVITRA without talking to your doctor. Your doctor may lower your dose or raise your dose, depending on how your body reacts to LEVITRA.</p>
<p>If you take too much LEVITRA, call your doctor or emergency room right away.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS OF LEVITRA?</span></p>
<p>The most common side effects with LEVITRA are <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318566" conceptname="Flushing">flushing</span>, stuffy or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4170297" conceptname="Sniffles">runny nose</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="23325" conceptname="Heartburn">indigestion</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012224" conceptname="Upset stomach">upset stomach</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>. These side effects usually go away after a few hours. Call your doctor if you get a side effect that bothers you or one that will not go away.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">LEVITRA may uncommonly cause:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="Bold">an erection that wonâ€™t go away (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315586" conceptname="Priapism">priapism</span>).</span> If you get an erection that lasts more than 4 hours, get medical help right away. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315586" conceptname="Priapism">Priapism</span> must be treated as soon as possible or lasting damage can happen to your penis including the inability to have erections.</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">color vision changes,</span> such as seeing a blue tinge to objects or having difficulty telling the difference between the colors blue and green. </li>
</ul>
<p>In rare instances, men taking PDE5 inhibitors (oral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">erectile dysfunction</span> medicines, including LEVITRA) reported a sudden decrease or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377551" conceptname="Blind hypertensive eye">loss of vision</span> in one or both eyes. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to these medicines, to other factors such as high blood pressure or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, or to a combination of these. If you experience sudden decrease or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377551" conceptname="Blind hypertensive eye">loss of vision</span>, stop taking PDE5 inhibitors, including LEVITRA, and call a doctor right away.</p>
<p>Sudden loss or decrease in hearing, sometimes with ringing in the ears and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, has been rarely reported in people taking PDE5 inhibitors, including LEVITRA. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the PDE5 inhibitors, to other diseases or medications, to other factors, or to a combination of factors. If you experience these symptoms, stop taking LEVITRA and contact a doctor right away.</p>
<p>These are not all the side effects of LEVITRA. For more information, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">HOW SHOULD LEVITRA BE STORED?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Store LEVITRA at room temperature between 59Â° and 86Â° F (15Â° to 30Â° C).</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Keep LEVITRA and all medicines out of the reach of children.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Bold">GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT LEVITRA.</span></p>
<p>Medicines are sometimes prescribed for conditions other than those described in patient information leaflets. Do not use LEVITRA for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give LEVITRA to other people, even if they have the same symptoms that you have. It may harm them.</p>
