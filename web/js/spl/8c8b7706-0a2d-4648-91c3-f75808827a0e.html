<h1>Clinical Pharmacology</h1>
<p class="First">Ampicillin diffuses readily into most body tissues and fluids. However, penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid and brain occurs only when the meninges are inflamed. Ampicillin is excreted largely unchanged in the urine and its excretion can be delayed by concurrent administration of probenecid. The active form appears in the bile in higher concentrations than those found in serum. Ampicillin is the least serum-bound of all the penicillins, averaging about 20% compared to approximately 60 to 90% for other penicillins. Ampicillin is well tolerated by most patients and has been given in doses of 2 grams daily for many weeks without adverse reactions. <br></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Microbiology</span>: While in vitro studies have demonstrated the susceptibility of most <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of the following organisms, clinical efficacy for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> other than those included in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section has not been demonstrated. The following bacteria have been shown in in vitro studies to be susceptible to ampicillin:</p>
<p><span class="Bold">GRAM-POSITIVE ORGANISMS</span>: Hemolytic and nonhemolytic streptococci, D. pneumoniae, non-penicillinase-producing staphylococci, Clostridia spp., B. anthracis, Listeria monocytogenes, and most <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of enterococci.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">GRAM-NEGATIVE ORGANISMS</span>: H. influenzae, N. gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, Proteus mirabilis, and many <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span>, Shigella, and E. coli.<br>Ampicillin does not resist destruction by penicillinase.<br><span class="Bold"></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Susceptibility Tests</span>: Ampicillin Susceptibility Test Discs, 10 mcg., should be used to estimate the in vitro susceptibility of bacteria to ampicillin.</p>

<h1>Indications and Usage</h1>
<p class="First">To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Ampicillin and other antibacterial drugs, Ampicillin should be used only to treat or prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Ampicillin is indicated in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> caused by susceptible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of the designated organisms in the conditions listed below:</p>

<h1>Contraindications</h1>
<p class="First">A history of a previous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reaction</span> to any of the penicillins is a contraindication.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34071-1">

<h1>Warnings</h1>
<p class="First">Serious and occasionally fatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> (anaphylactoid) reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy. Although <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylaxis</span> is more frequent following parenteral therapy, it has occurred in patients on oral penicillins. These reactions are more apt to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens.<br>There have been well-documented reports of individuals with a history of penicillin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span> who have experienced severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span> when treated with a cephalosporin. Before initiating therapy with a penicillin, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span> to penicillins, cephalosporins, and other allergens. If an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergic reaction</span> occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. <br></p>
<p>SERIOUS <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4148381" conceptname="Anaphylactoid reaction">ANAPHYLACTOID REACTIONS</span> REQUIRE IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE, OXYGEN, INTRAVENOUS STEROIDS, AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING INTUBATION, SHOULD ALSO BE ADMINISTERED AS INDICATED.</p>
<p>Clostridium difficile associated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span> (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Ampicillin for Injection, and may range in severity from mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span> to fatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4272488" conceptname="Colitis">colitis</span>. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.</p>
<p>C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD.Â  Hypertoxin producing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patents who present with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span> following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. <br></p>
<p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.<br></p>

<h1>Precautions</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">General</span>: Prescribing Ampicillin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432545" conceptname="Bacterial infectious disease">bacterial infection</span> or a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118659" conceptname="Prophylactic">prophylactic</span> indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. The possibility of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4105019" conceptname="Superimposed infection">superinfections</span> with mycotic organisms or bacterial pathogens should be kept in mind during therapy. In such cases,<br>discontinue the drug and substitute appropriate treatment. A high percentage (43 to 100 percent) of patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437784" conceptname="Infectious mononucleosis">infectious mononucleosis</span> who receive ampicillin develop a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">skin rash</span>.<br>Typically, the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> appears 7 to 10 days after the start of oral ampicillin therapy and remains for a few days to a week after the drug is discontinued. In most cases, the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> is maculopapular; pruritic and generalized. Therefore, the administration of ampicillin is not recommended in patients with mononucleosis. It is not known whether these patients are truly allergic to ampicillin.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Information for Patients</span>: <br></p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">Diarrhea</span> is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443530" conceptname="Hematochezia">bloody stools</span> (with or without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194175" conceptname="Left upper quadrant pain">stomach cramps</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.<br></p>
<p>Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Ampicillin for Injection should only be used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432545" conceptname="Bacterial infectious disease">bacterial infections</span>. They do not treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440029" conceptname="Viral disease">viral infections</span> (e.g., the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">common cold</span>). When Ampicillin for Injection is prescribed to treat a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432545" conceptname="Bacterial infectious disease">bacterial infection</span>, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Ampicillin for Injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Laboratory Tests</span>: As with any potent drug, periodic assessment of organ system function, including renal, hepatic and hematopoietic, should be made during prolonged therapy.<br>Transient elevation of serum transaminase has been observed following administration of ampicillin. The significance of this finding is not known.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions:</span> The concurrent administration of allopurinol and ampicillin increases substantially the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">skin rashes</span> in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving ampicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of ampicillin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rashes</span> is due to allopurinol or the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4147761" conceptname="Hyperuricemia">hyperuricemia</span> present in these patients.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions:</span> With high urine concentrations of ampicillin, false-positive glucose reactions may occur if Clinitest, Benedict's Solution, or Fehling's Solution are used. Therefore, it is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as Clinistix or Tes-Tape) be used.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility:</span> No long-term animal studies have been conducted with this drug.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy category B:</span> Reproduction studies have been performed in laboratory animals at doses several times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of adverse effects due to ampicillin. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Labor and Delivery</span>: Oral ampicillin-class antibiotics are poorly absorbed during labor. Studies in guinea pigs showed that intravenous administration of ampicillin slightly decreased the uterine tone and frequency of contractions, but moderately increased the height and duration of contractions. However, it is not known whether use of these drugs in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood that forceps delivery or other obstetrical intervention of resuscitation of the newborn will be necessary.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers:</span> Ampicillin is excreted in trace amounts in human milk. Therefore, caution should be exercised when ampicillin-class antibiotics are administered to a nursing woman.<br>Pediatric Use: Guidelines for the administration of these drugs to children are presented in DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.</p>

<h1>Adverse Reactions</h1>
<p class="First">As with other penicillins, it may be expected that untoward reactions will be essentially limited to sensitivity phenomena. They are more likely to occur in individuals who have previously demonstrated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> to penicillins and in those with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergy</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256439" conceptname="Allergic rhinitis due to pollen">hay fever</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="139900" conceptname="Urticaria">urticaria</span> The following adverse reactions have been reported as associated with the use of ampicillin:</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal</span>: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436147" conceptname="Glossitis">Glossitis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138455" conceptname="Stomatitis">stomatitis</span>, black â€œhairyâ€? tongue, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184503" conceptname="Enterocolitis">enterocolitis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4265457" conceptname="Pseudomembranous enterocolitis">pseudomembranous colitis</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>. (These reactions are usually associated with oral dosage forms.)</p>

A few cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4270887" conceptname="Erythroderma">exfoliative dermatitis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="132702" conceptname="Erythema multiforme">erythema multiforme</span> have been reported. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">Anaphylaxis</span> is the most serious reaction experienced and has usually been associated with the parenteral dosage form.<br><span class="Bold">Note</span>: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="139900" conceptname="Urticaria">Urticaria</span>, other <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">skin rashes</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432522" conceptname="Transfusion reaction due to serum protein reaction">serum sickness</span>-like reactions may be controlled with antihistamines and, if necessary, systemic corticosteroids. Whenever such reactions occur, ampicillin should be discontinued, unless, in the opinion of the physician, the condition being treated is life-threatening and amenable only to ampicillin therapy. Serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylactic reactions</span> require the immediate use of epinephrine, oxygen, and intravenous steroids.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Liver</span>: A moderate rise in serum glutamic oxaloacetic transminase (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4094657" conceptname="Aspartate aminotransferase">SGOT</span>) has been noted, particularly in infants, but the significance of this finding is unknown. Mild transitory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4094657" conceptname="Aspartate aminotransferase">SGOT</span> elevations have been observed in individuals receiving larger (two to four times) than usual and oft-repeated intramuscular injections. Evidence indicates that glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) is released at the site of intramuscular injection of Ampicillin for Injection and that the presence of increased amounts of this enzyme in the blood does not necessarily indicate liver involvement.</p>
