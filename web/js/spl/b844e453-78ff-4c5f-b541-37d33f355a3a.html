<h2>Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Dipropionate</h2>
<p class="First">Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Dipropionate Cream, USP has been shown to be at least as effective as clotrimazole alone in a different cream vehicle. No comparative studies have been conducted with Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Dipropionate Lotion and clotrimazole alone. Use of corticosteroids in the treatment of a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432248" conceptname="Opportunistic mycosis">fungal infection</span> may lead to suppression of host <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> leading to worsening or decreased cure rate.</p>

<h2>Clotrimazole</h2>
<p class="First">Skin penetration and systemic absorption of clotrimazole following topical application of Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Dipropionate Cream or Lotion have not been studied. The following information was obtained using 1% clotrimazole cream and solution formulations. Six hours after the application of radioactive clotrimazole 1% cream and 1% solution onto intact and acutely inflamed skin, the concentration of clotrimazole varied from 100 mcg/cm<span class="Sup">3</span> in the stratum corneum, to 0.5 to 1 mcg/cm<span class="Sup">3</span> in the reticular dermis, and 0.1 mcg/cm<span class="Sup">3</span> in the subcutis. No measurable amount of radioactivity (&lt;0.001 mcg/mL) was found in the serum within 48 hours after application under occlusive dressing of 0.5 mL of the solution or 0.8 g of the cream. Only 0.5% or less of the applied radioactivity was excreted in the urine.</p>

<h4>Mechanism of Action</h4>
<p class="First">Clotrimazole is an imidazole antifungal agent. Imidazoles inhibit 14-α-demethylation of lanosterol in fungi by binding to one of the cytochrome P-450 enzymes. This leads to the accumulation of 14-α-methylsterols and reduced concentrations of ergosterol, a sterol essential for a normal fungal cytoplasmic membrane. The methylsterols may affect the electron transport system, thereby inhibiting growth of fungi.</p>

<h2>Betamethasone Dipropionate</h2>
<p class="First">Betamethasone dipropionate, a corticosteroid, has been shown to have topical (dermatologic) and systemic pharmacologic and metabolic effects characteristic of this class of drugs.</p>

<h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3>
<p class="First">The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_96f81829-98a1-43e2-a2a0-7f85b96ca8a4">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span> section.) Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">Inflammation</span> and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_96f81829-98a1-43e2-a2a0-7f85b96ca8a4">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span> section.)</p>
<p>Once absorbed through the skin, the pharmacokinetics of topical corticosteroids are similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile.</p>
<p>Studies performed with Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Dipropionate Cream and Lotion indicate that these topical combination antifungal/corticosteroids may have vasoconstrictor potencies in a range that is comparable to high potency topical corticosteroids. Therefore, use is not recommended in patients less than 17 years of age, in diaper <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133835" conceptname="Eczema">dermatitis</span>, and under occlusion.</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span>, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on treatment.</p>
<p>Conditions which augment systemic absorption include use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and use under occlusive dressings. Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase total systemic glucocorticoid exposure. Patients applying Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Dipropionate Cream or Lotion to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA-axis suppression. This may be done by using the ACTH stimulation, morning plasma cortisol, and urinary-free cortisol tests.</p>
<p>If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids.</p>
<p>In a small study, Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Dipropionate Cream, USP was applied using large dosages, 7 g daily for 14 days (BID) to the crural area of normal adult subjects. Three of the eight normal subjects on whom Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Dipropionate Cream, USP was applied exhibited low morning plasma cortisol levels during treatment. One of these subjects had an abnormal Cortrosyn test. The effect on morning plasma cortisol was transient and subjects recovered one week after discontinuing dosing. In addition, two separate studies in pediatric patients demonstrated adrenal suppression as determined by cosyntropin testing (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_pediatric_use_id_b2edeca0-b2f1-40a2-8886-92051c2a3efa">PRECAUTIONS – Pediatric Use</a></span> section).</p>
<p>Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> ratios (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_pediatric_use_id_b2edeca0-b2f1-40a2-8886-92051c2a3efa">PRECAUTIONS – Pediatric Use</a></span> section).</p>
<p>If irritation develops, Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Dipropionate Cream or Lotion should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">There are no adequate laboratory animal studies with either the combination of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate or with either component individually to evaluate carcinogenesis.</p>
<p>Betamethasone was negative in the bacterial mutagenicity assay (<span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span> typhimurium</span> and <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span>), and in the mammalian cell mutagenicity assay (CHO/HGPRT). It was positive in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay, and equivocal in the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay. This pattern of response is similar to that of dexamethasone and hydrocortisone.</p>
<p>Reproductive studies with betamethasone dipropionate carried out in rabbits at doses of 1.0 mg/kg by the intramuscular route and in mice up to 33 mg/kg by the intramuscular route indicated no impairment of fertility except for dose-related increases in fetal resorption rates in both species. These doses are approximately 5- and 38-fold the maximum human dose based on body surface areas, respectively.</p>
<p>In a combined study of the effects of clotrimazole on fertility, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span>, and postnatal development, male and female rats were dosed orally (diet admixture) with levels of 5, 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 1-8 times the maximum dose in a 60 kg adult based on body surface area) from 10 weeks prior to mating until 4 weeks postpartum. No adverse effects on the duration of estrous cycle, fertility, or duration of pregnancy were noted.</p>

<h4>Pregnancy Category C</h4>
<p class="First">There have been no teratogenic studies performed in animals or humans with the combination of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate. Corticosteroids are generally teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered at relatively low dosage levels.</p>
<p>Studies in pregnant rats with intravaginal doses up to 100 mg/kg (15 times the maximum human dose) revealed no evidence of fetotoxicity due to clotrimazole exposure.</p>
<p>No increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079975" conceptname="Congenital malformation">fetal malformations</span> was noted in pregnant rats receiving oral (gastric tube) clotrimazole doses up to 100 mg/kg/day during gestation days 6-15. However, clotrimazole dosed at 100 mg/kg/day was embryotoxic (increased resorptions), fetotoxic (reduced fetal weights) and maternally toxic (reduced body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span>) to rats. Clotrimazole dosed at 200 mg/kg/day (30 times the maximum human dose) was maternally lethal and therefore fetuses were not evaluated in this group. Also in this study, doses up to 50 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human dose) had no adverse effects on dams or fetuses. However, in the combined fertility, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span>, and postnatal development study described above, 50 mg/kg clotrimazole, was associated with reduced maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span> and reduced numbers of offspring reared to 4 weeks.</p>
<p>Oral clotrimazole doses of 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg/day (2-15 times the maximum human dose) were not teratogenic in mice. No evidence of maternal toxicity or embryotoxicity was seen in pregnant rabbits dosed orally with 60, 120, or 180 mg/kg/day (18-55 times the maximum human dose).</p>
<p>Betamethasone dipropionate has been shown to be teratogenic in rabbits when given by the intramuscular route at doses of 0.05 mg/kg. This dose is approximately one-fifth the maximum human dose. The abnormalities observed included <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245842" conceptname="Umbilical hernia">umbilical hernias</span>, cephalocele and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135923" conceptname="Cleft palate">cleft palates</span>.</p>
<p>Betamethasone dipropionate has not been tested for teratogenic potential by the dermal route of administration. Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application to laboratory animals.</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women of the teratogenic effects of topically applied corticosteroids. Therefore, Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Dipropionate Cream or Lotion should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroids production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Dipropionate Cream or Lotion is administered to a nursing woman.</p>

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Adverse events consistent with corticosteroid use have been observed in patients under 12 years of age treated with Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Dipropionate Cream, USP.
