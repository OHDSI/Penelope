<a href="#section-"></a><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION</span><br><p class="First">CIPRO<span class="Sup">Â®</span> HC OTIC (ciprofloxacin 
hydrochloride and hydrocortisone otic suspension) contains the synthetic broad 
spectrum antibacterial agent, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, combined with the 
anti-inflammatory corticosteroid, hydrocortisone, in a preserved, nonsterile 
suspension for otic use. Each mL of CIPRO<span class="Sup">Â®</span> HC OTIC 
contains ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (equivalent to 2 mg ciprofloxacin), 10 mg 
hydrocortisone, and 9 mg benzyl alcohol as a preservative. The inactive 
ingredients are polyvinyl alcohol, sodium chloride, sodium acetate, glacial 
acetic acid, phospholipon 90H (modified lecithin), polysorbate, and purified 
water. Sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid may be added for adjustment of 
pH.</p>
<p>Ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, is available as the monohydrochloride 
monohydrate salt of 
1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-(1-piperazinyl)-3-quinolinecarboxylic 
acid. Its empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">17</span>H<span class="Sub">18</span>FN<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">3</span>â€¢HCIâ€¢H<span class="Sub">2</span>O and its chemical structure is

<a href="#section-"></a><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY<br><br></span><p class="First">The plasma concentrations of ciprofloxacin were not measured 
following three drops of otic suspension administration because the systemic 
exposure to ciprofloxacin is expected to be below the limit of quantitation of 
the assay (0.05 Âµg/mL).</p>
<p>Similarly, the predicted Cmax of hydrocortisone is within the range of 
endogenous hydrocortisone concentration (0-150 ng/mL), and therefore can not be 
differentiated from the endogenous cortisol.</p>
<p>Preclinical studies have shown that CIPRO<span class="Sup">Â®</span> HC OTIC was 
not toxic to the guinea pig cochlea when administered intratympanically twice 
daily for 30 days and was only weakly irritating to rabbit skin upon repeated 
exposure.</p>
<p>Hydrocortisone has been added to aid in the resolution of the inflammatory 
response accompanying <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432545" conceptname="Bacterial infectious disease">bacterial infection</span>.</p>
<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a>Microbiology<p>Ciprofloxacin has in vitro activity against a wide range of 
gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. The bactericidal action of 
ciprofloxacin results from interference with the enzyme, DNA gyrase, which is 
needed for the synthesis of bacterial DNA. Cross-resistance has been observed 
between ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones. There is generally no 
cross-resistance between ciprofloxacin and other classes of antibacterial agents 
such as beta-lactams or aminoglycosides.</p>
<p>Ciprofloxacin has been shown to be active against most <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of the 
following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> of acute

<p><span class="Italics">E. coli</span> DNA Repair Assay (Negative)</p>

<p><span class="Italics">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> Mitotic Crossover and

<p>Rat Hepatocyte DNA Repair Assay</p>
<p>Micronucleus Test (Mice)</p>
<p>Dominant Lethal Test (Mice)</p>
<p>Long-term carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats have been completed for 
ciprofloxacin. After daily oral doses of 750 mg/kg (mice) and 250 mg/kg (rats) 
were administered for up to 2 years, there was no evidence that ciprofloxacin 
had any carcinogenic or tumorigenic effects in these species. No long term 
studies of CIPRO<span class="Sup">Â®</span> HC OTIC suspension have been performed 
to evaluate carcinogenic potential.</p>
<p>Fertility studies performed in rats at oral doses of ciprofloxacin up to 100 
mg/kg/day revealed no evidence of impairment. This would be over 1000 times the 
maximum recommended clinical dose of ototopical ciprofloxacin based upon body 
surface area, assuming total absorption of ciprofloxacin from the ear of a 
patient treated with CIPRO<span class="Sup">Â®</span> HC OTIC twice per day.</p>
<p>Long term studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic 
potential or the effect on fertility of topical hydrocortisone. Mutagenicity 
studies with hydrocortisone were negative.</p>

oral doses of up to 100 mg/kg and IV doses up to 30 mg/kg and have revealed no

<p>Corticosteroids are generally teratogenic in laboratory animals when

corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in 
laboratory animals.</p>
<p>Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with CIPRO<span class="Sup">Â®</span> HC OTIC. No adequate and well controlled studies have been

not known whether ciprofloxacin is excreted in human milk following topical otic

nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to 
discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the

<p>For children (age 1 year and older) and adults, 3 drops of the suspension 
should be instilled into the affected ear twice daily for seven days. The 
suspension should be warmed by holding the bottle in the hand for 1-2 minutes to 
avoid the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span> which may result from the instillation of a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">cold</span> solution 
into the ear canal. The patient should lie with the affected ear upward and then 
the drops should be instilled. This position should be maintained for 30-60 
seconds to facilitate penetration of the drops into the ear. Repeat, if 
necessary, for the opposite ear. Discard unused portion after therapy is 
completed.</p>
