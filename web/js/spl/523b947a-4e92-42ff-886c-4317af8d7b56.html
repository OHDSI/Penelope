<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">RELPAX<span class="Sup">®</span>  (eletriptan) Tablets contain eletriptan hydrobromide, which is a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B/1D (5-HT1B/1D) receptor agonist.  Eletriptan is chemically designated as (R)-3-[(1-Methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl]-5-[2-(phenylsulfonyl)ethyl]-1H-indole monohydrobromide, and it has the following chemical structure:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="Chemical Structure" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=523b947a-4e92-42ff-886c-4317af8d7b56&amp;name=relpax-01.jpg"></div>
<p>The empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">22</span>H<span class="Sub">26</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span>S . HBr, representing a molecular weight of 463.40.  Eletriptan hydrobromide is a white to light <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260836" conceptname="Blanching of skin">pale</span> colored powder that is readily soluble in water.</p>
<p>Each RELPAX Tablet for oral administration contains 24.2 or 48.5 mg of eletriptan hydrobromide equivalent to 20 mg or 40 mg of eletriptan, respectively.  Each tablet also contains the inactive ingredients microcrystalline cellulose NF, lactose NF, croscarmellose sodium NF, magnesium stearate NF, titanium dioxide USP, hypromellose, triacetin USP and FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6 aluminum lake.</p>

<a name="section-2.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Eletriptan binds with high affinity to 5-HT<span class="Sub">1B</span>, 5-HT<span class="Sub">1D</span> and 5-HT<span class="Sub">1F</span> receptors, has modest affinity for 5-HT<span class="Sub">1A</span>, 5-HT<span class="Sub">1E</span>, 5-HT<span class="Sub">2B</span> and 5-HT<span class="Sub">7</span> receptors, and little or no affinity for 5-HT<span class="Sub">2A</span>, 5-HT<span class="Sub">2C</span>, 5-HT<span class="Sub">3</span>, 5-HT<span class="Sub">4</span>, 5-HT<span class="Sub">5A</span> and 5-HT<span class="Sub">6</span> receptors.  Eletriptan has no significant affinity or pharmacological activity at adrenergic alpha<span class="Sub">1</span>, alpha<span class="Sub">2</span>, or beta; dopaminergic D<span class="Sub">1</span> or D<span class="Sub">2</span>; muscarinic; or opioid receptors.</p>
<p>Two theories have been proposed to explain the efficacy of 5-HT receptor agonists in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">migraine</span>.  One theory suggests that activation of 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> receptors located on intracranial blood vessels, including those on the arteriovenous anastomoses, leads to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137788" conceptname="Vascular constriction">vasoconstriction</span>, which is correlated with the relief of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">migraine headache</span>.  The other hypothesis suggests that activation of 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> receptors on sensory nerve endings in the trigeminal system results in the inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release.</p>
<p>In the anesthetized dog, eletriptan has been shown to reduce carotid arterial blood flow, with only a small increase in arterial blood pressure at high doses.  While the effect on blood flow was selective for the carotid arterial bed, decreases in coronary artery diameter were observed.  Eletriptan has also been shown to inhibit trigeminal nerve activity in the rat.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-2.2.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Absorption</h3>
<p class="First">Eletriptan is well absorbed after oral administration with peak plasma levels occurring approximately 1.5 hours after dosing to healthy subjects.  In patients with moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">migraine</span> the median T<span class="Sub">max</span> is 2.0 hours.  The mean absolute bioavailability of eletriptan is approximately 50%.  The oral pharmacokinetics are slightly more than dose-proportional over the clinical dose range.  The AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of eletriptan are increased by approximately 20 to 30% following oral administration with a high fat meal. </p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-2.2.2"></a><p></p>
<h3>Distribution</h3>
<p class="First">The volume of distribution of eletriptan following IV administration is 138L.  Plasma protein binding is moderate and approximately 85%. </p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-2.2.3"></a><p></p>
<h3>Metabolism</h3>
<p class="First">The N-demethylated metabolite of eletriptan is the only known active metabolite.  This metabolite causes <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137788" conceptname="Vascular constriction">vasoconstriction</span> similar to eletriptan in animal models.  Though the half-life of the metabolite is estimated to be about 13 hours, the plasma concentration of the N-demethylated metabolite is 10–20% of parent drug and is unlikely to contribute significantly to the overall effect of the parent compound.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies indicate that eletriptan is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P-450 enzyme CYP3A4 (see <a href="#Warnings">WARNINGS</a>, <a href="#Dosage_And_Administration">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a> and <a href="#Drug_Interactions">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interactions</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-2.2.4"></a><p></p>
<h3>Elimination</h3>
<p class="First">The terminal elimination half-life of eletriptan is approximately 4 hours.  Mean renal clearance (CL<span class="Sub">R</span>) following oral administration is approximately 3.9 L/h.  Non-renal clearance accounts for about 90% of the total clearance.</p>

<h2>Special Populations</h2>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-2.3.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Age</h3>
<p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of eletriptan are generally unaffected by age.</p>
<p>Eletriptan has been given to only 50 patients over the age of 65.  Blood pressure was increased to a greater extent in elderly subjects than in young subjects.  The pharmacokinetic disposition of eletriptan in the elderly is similar to that seen in younger adults (see <a href="#Precautions">PRECAUTIONS</a>). </p>
<p>There is a statistically significant increased half-life (from about 4.4 hours to 5.7 hours) between elderly (65 to 93 years of age) and younger adult subjects (18 to 45 years of age) (see <a href="#Precautions">PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>

<a name="section-2.3.3"></a><p></p>
<h3>Race</h3>
<p class="First">A comparison of pharmacokinetic studies run in western countries with those run in Japan has indicated an approximate 35% reduction in the exposure of eletriptan in Japanese male volunteers compared to western males.  Population pharmacokinetic analysis of two clinical studies indicates no evidence of pharmacokinetic differences between Caucasians and non-Caucasian patients<span class="Bold">.</span></p>

<p class="First">The effects of severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> on eletriptan metabolism have not been evaluated.  Subjects with mild or moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> demonstrated an increase in both AUC (34%) and half-life.

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-2.4.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>CYP3A4 inhibitors</h3>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies have shown that eletriptan is metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme.  A clinical study demonstrated about a 3-fold increase in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and about a 6-fold increase in the AUC of eletriptan when combined with ketoconazole.  The half-life increased from 5 hours to 8 hours and the T<span class="Sub">max</span> increased from 2.8 hours to 5.4 hours.  Another clinical study demonstrated about a 2-fold increase in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and about a 4-fold increase in AUC when erythromycin was co-administered with eletriptan.  It has also been shown that co-administration of verapamil and eletriptan yields about a 2-fold increase in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and about a 3-fold increase in AUC of eletriptan, and that co-administration of fluconazole and eletriptan yields about a 1.4-fold increase in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and about a 2-fold increase in AUC of eletriptan. </p>
<p>Eletriptan should not be used within at least 72 hours of treatment with the following potent CYP3A4 inhibitors: ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir and nelfinavir.  Eletriptan should not be used within 72 hours with drugs that have demonstrated potent CYP3A4 inhibition and have this potent effect described in the <a href="#Contraindications">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>, <a href="#Warnings">WARNINGS</a> or <a href="#Precautions">PRECAUTIONS</a> sections of their labeling (see <a href="#Warnings">WARNINGS</a> and <a href="#Dosage_And_Administration">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>). </p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-2.4.2"></a><p></p>
<h3>Propranolol</h3>
<p class="First">The C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of eletriptan were increased by 10 and 33%, respectively, in the presence of propranolol.  No interactive increases in blood pressure were observed.  No dosage adjustment appears to be needed for patients taking propranolol (see <a href="#Precautions">PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-2.4.3"></a><p></p>
<h3>The effect of eletriptan on other drugs</h3>
<p class="First">The effect of eletriptan on enzymes other than cytochrome P-450 has not been investigated.  <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> human liver microsome studies suggest that eletriptan has little potential to inhibit CYP1A2, 2C9, 2E1 and 3A4 at concentrations up to 100µM.  While eletriptan has an effect on CYP2D6 at high concentration, this effect should not interfere with metabolism of other drugs when eletriptan is used at recommended doses.  There is no <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> or <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> evidence that clinical doses of eletriptan will induce drug metabolizing enzymes.  Therefore, eletriptan is unlikely to cause clinically important drug interactions mediated by these enzymes.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First">The efficacy of RELPAX in the acute treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">migraines</span> was evaluated in eight randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled studies.  All eight studies used 40 mg. Seven studies evaluated an 80 mg dose and two studies included a 20 mg dose.</p>
<p>In all eight studies, randomized patients treated their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headaches</span> as outpatients.  Seven studies enrolled adults and one study enrolled adolescents (age 11 to 17).  Patients treated in the seven adult studies were predominantly female (85%) and Caucasian (94%) with a mean age of 40 years (range 18 to 78).  In all studies, patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">Headache</span> response, defined as a reduction in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> severity from moderate or severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> to mild or no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, was assessed up to 2 hours after dosing.  Associated symptoms such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260194" conceptname="Photophobia">photophobia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4209114" conceptname="Phonophobia">phonophobia</span> were also assessed.</p>
<p>Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours post dose.  In the adult studies, a second dose of RELPAX Tablets or other medication was allowed 2 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for both persistent and recurrent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headaches</span>.  The incidence and time to use of these additional treatments were also recorded. </p>
<p>In the seven adult studies, the percentage of patients achieving <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> response 2 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients receiving RELPAX Tablets at all doses compared to those who received placebo.  The two-hour response rates from these controlled clinical studies are summarized in Table 1. </p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Because of the potential of 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span>  agonists to cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4127089" conceptname="Coronary artery spasm">coronary vasospasm</span>, eletriptan should not be given to patients with documented ischemic or vasospastic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317576" conceptname="Coronary arteriosclerosis">coronary artery disease</span> (CAD) (see <a href="#Contraindications">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>).  It is strongly recommended that eletriptan not be given to patients in whom unrecognized CAD is predicted by the presence of risk factors (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437827" conceptname="Pure hypercholesterolemia">hypercholesterolemia</span>, smoker, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433736" conceptname="Obesity">obesity</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, strong family history of CAD, female with surgical or physiological <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span>, or male over 40 years of age) unless a cardiovascular evaluation provides satisfactory clinical evidence that the patient is reasonably free of coronary artery and ischemic myocardial disease or other significant underlying cardiovascular disease.  The sensitivity of cardiac diagnostic procedures to detect cardiovascular disease or predisposition to coronary artery <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4215494" conceptname="Vasospasm">vasospasm</span> is modest, at best.

<h2>Binding to Melanin-Containing Tissues</h2>
<p class="First">In rats treated with a single intravenous (3 mg/kg) dose of radio-labeled eletriptan, elimination of radioactivity from the retina was prolonged, suggesting that eletriptan and/or its metabolites may bind to the melanin of the eye.  Because there could be accumulation in melanin-rich tissues over time, this raises the possibility that eletriptan could cause toxicity in these tissues after extended use. Although no systematic monitoring of ophthalmologic function was undertaken in clinical trials, and no specific recommendations for ophthalmologic monitoring are offered, prescribers should be aware of the possibility of long-term ophthalmologic effects.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis</h2>
<p class="First">Lifetime carcinogenicity studies, 104 weeks in duration, were carried out in mice and rats by administering eletriptan in the diet.  In rats, the incidence of testicular interstitial cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> was increased at the high dose of 75 mg/kg/day.  The estimated exposure (AUC) to parent drug at that dose was approximately 6 times that achieved in humans receiving the maximum recommended daily dose (MRDD) of 80 mg, and at the no-effect dose of 15 mg/kg/day it was approximately 2 times the human exposure at the MRDD.  In mice, the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4301500" conceptname="Liver cell adenoma">hepatocellular adenomas</span> was increased at the high dose of 400 mg/kg/day.  The exposure to parent drug (AUC) at that dose was approximately 18 times that achieved in humans receiving the MRDD, and the AUC at the no-effect dose of 90 mg/kg/day was approximately 7 times the human exposure at the MRDD.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34083-6">
<a name="section-7.11"></a><p></p>
<h2>Mutagenesis</h2>
<p class="First">Eletriptan was not mutagenic in bacterial or mammalian cell assays <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>, testing negative in the Ames reverse mutation test and the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT) mutation test in Chinese hamster ovary cells.  It was not clastogenic in two <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus assays.  Results were equivocal in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> human lymphocyte clastogenicity tests, in which the incidence of polyploidy was increased in the absence of metabolic activation (-S9 conditions), but not in the presence of metabolic activation.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34083-6">
<a name="section-7.12"></a><p></p>
<h2>Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">In a rat fertility and early embryonic development study, doses tested were 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day, resulting in systemic exposures to parent drug in rats, based on AUC, that were 4, 8 and 16 times MRDD, respectively, in males and 7, 14 and 28 times MRDD, respectively, in females.  There was a prolongation of the estrous cycle at the 200 mg/kg/day dose due to an increase in duration of estrus, based on vaginal smears.  There were also dose-related, statistically significant decreases in mean numbers of corpora lutea per dam at all 3 doses, resulting in decreases in mean numbers of implants and viable fetuses per dam.  This suggests a partial inhibition of ovulation by eletriptan.  There was no effect on fertility of males and no other effect on fertility of females.</p>

<h2>Pregnancy</h2>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-7.13.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Pregnancy Category C</h3>
<p class="First">In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of eletriptan was associated with developmental toxicity (decreased fetal and pup weights and an increased incidence of fetal structural abnormalities).  Effects on fetal and pup weights were observed at doses that were, on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, 6 to 12 times greater than the clinical maximum recommended daily dose (MRDD) of 80 mg.  The increase in structural alterations occurred in the rat and rabbit at doses that, on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, were 12 times greater than (rat) and approximately equal to (rabbit) the MRDD. </p>
<p>When pregnant rats were administered eletriptan during the period of organogenesis at doses of 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg/day, fetal weights were decreased and the incidences of vertebral and sternebral variations were increased at 100 mg/kg/day (approximately 12 times the MRDD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).  The 100 mg/kg dose was also maternally toxic, as evidenced by decreased maternal body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span> during gestation.  The no-effect dose for developmental toxicity in rats exposed during organogenesis was 30 mg/kg, which is approximately 4 times the MRDD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.  </p>
<p>When doses of 5, 10 or 50 mg/kg/day were given to New Zealand White rabbits throughout organogenesis, fetal weights were decreased at 50 mg/kg, which is approximately 12 times the MRDD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.  The incidences of fused sternebrae and vena cava deviations were increased in all treated groups.  Maternal toxicity was not produced at any dose.  A no-effect dose for developmental toxicity in rabbits exposed during organogenesis was not established, and the 5 mg/kg dose is approximately equal to the MRDD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; therefore, eletriptan should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Eletriptan is excreted in human breast milk.  In one study of 8 women given a single dose of 80 mg, the mean total amount of eletriptan in breast milk over 24 hours in this group was approximately 0.02% of the administered dose.  The ratio of eletriptan mean concentration in breast milk to plasma was 1:4, but there was great variability.  The resulting eletriptan concentration-time profile was similar to that seen in the plasma over 24 hours, with very low concentrations of drug (mean 1.7 ng/mL) still present in the milk 18–24 hours post dose.  The N-desmethyl active metabolite was not measured in the breast milk.  Caution should be exercised when RELPAX is administered to nursing women.</p>

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of RELPAX Tablets in pediatric patients have not been established; therefore, RELPAX is not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. </p>
<p>The efficacy of RELPAX Tablets (40 mg) in patients 11–17 was not established in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 274 adolescent migraineurs (see <a href="#Clinical_Studies">CLINICAL STUDIES</a>).  Adverse events observed were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. Postmarketing experience with other triptans includes a limited number of reports that describe pediatric patients who have experienced clinically serious adverse events that are similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults.  Long-term safety of eletriptan was studied in 76 adolescent patients who received treatment for up to one year.  A similar profile of adverse events to that of adults was observed.  The long-term safety of eletriptan in pediatric patients has not been established.</p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34082-8">
<a name="section-7.16"></a><p></p>
<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Eletriptan has been given to only 50 patients over the age of 65.  Blood pressure was increased to a greater extent in elderly subjects than in young subjects.  The pharmacokinetic disposition of eletriptan in the elderly is similar to that seen in younger adults (see <a href="#Clinical_Pharmacology">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>).  In clinical trials, there were no apparent differences in efficacy or the incidence of adverse events between patients under 65 years of age and those 65 and above (n=50).</p>
<p>There is a statistically significantly increased half-life (from about 4.4 hours to 5.7 hours) between elderly (65 to 93 years of age) and younger adult subjects (18 to 45 years of age) (see <a href="#Clinical_Pharmacology">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>). </p>

<h2>Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials</h2>
<p class="First">Among 4,597 patients who treated the first <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">migraine headache</span> with RELPAX in short-term placebo-controlled trials, the most common adverse events reported with treatment with RELPAX were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">asthenia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>.  These events appear to be dose-related.</p>
<p>In long-term open-label studies where patients were allowed to treat multiple <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">migraine</span> attacks for up to 1 year, 128 (8.3%) out of 1,544 patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events.</p>
<p>Table 2 lists adverse events that occurred in the subset of 5,125 migraineurs who received eletriptan doses of 20 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg or placebo in worldwide placebo-controlled clinical trials.  The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population.  In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, those frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ.</p>
<p>Only adverse events that were more frequent in a RELPAX treatment group compared to the placebo group with an incidence greater than or equal to 2% are included in Table 2.</p>

<p>RELPAX is generally well tolerated.  Across all doses, most adverse reactions were mild and transient. The frequency of adverse events in clinical trials did not increase when up to 2 doses of RELPAX were taken within 24 hours. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender, age, or race of the patients. Adverse event frequencies were also unchanged by concomitant use of drugs commonly taken for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">migraine</span> prophylaxis (e.g., SSRIs, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants), estrogen replacement therapy and oral contraceptives. </p>

<h2>Other Events Observed in Association With the Administration of RELPAX Tablets</h2>
<p class="First">In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented.  Because the reports include events observed in open studies, the role of RELPAX Tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined.  Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided.  Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients reporting an event divided by the total number of patients (N=4,719) exposed to RELPAX.  All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 2, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug.  Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients. </p>

<h2>Other Events Observed During Post-Marketing Use</h2>
<p class="First">The following adverse reaction(s) have been identified during postapproval use of RELPAX.

<p class="First">Although the abuse potential of RELPAX has not been assessed, no abuse of, tolerance to, withdrawal from, or drug-seeking behavior was observed in patients who received RELPAX in clinical trials or their extensions.  The 5-HT<span class="Sub">1B/1D</span> agonists, as a class, have not been associated with drug abuse.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">No significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> in premarketing clinical trials have been reported. Volunteers (N=21) have received single doses of 120 mg without significant adverse effects.  Daily doses of 160 mg were commonly employed in Phase III trials. Based on the pharmacology of  the  5-HT<span class="Sub">1B/1D</span> agonists, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> or other more serious cardiovascular symptoms could occur on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>.</p>
<p>The elimination half-life of eletriptan is about 4 hours (see <a href="#Clinical_Pharmacology">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>) and therefore monitoring of patients after <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> with eletriptan should continue for at least 20 hours, or longer should symptoms or signs persist.</p>
<p>There is no specific antidote to eletriptan.  In cases of severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>, intensive care procedures are recommended, including establishing and maintaining a patent airway, ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and monitoring and support of the cardiovascular system.</p>
<p>It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the serum concentration of eletriptan.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">In controlled clinical trials, single doses of 20 mg and 40 mg were effective for the acute treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">migraine</span> in adults.  A greater proportion of patients had a response following a 40 mg dose than following a 20 mg dose (see <a href="#Clinical_Studies">CLINICAL STUDIES</a>). Individuals may vary in response to doses of RELPAX Tablets.  The choice of dose should therefore be made on an individual basis. An 80 mg dose, although also effective, was associated with an increased incidence of adverse events. Therefore, the maximum recommended single dose is 40 mg.</p>
<p>If after the initial dose, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> improves but then returns, a repeat dose may be beneficial.  If a second dose is required, it should be taken at least 2 hours after the initial dose.  If the initial dose is ineffective, controlled clinical trials have not shown a benefit of a second dose to treat the same attack. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 80 mg.</p>
<p>The safety of treating an average of more than 3 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headaches</span> in a 30-day period has not been established.</p>

<h2>CYP3A4 Inhibitors</h2>
<p class="First">Eletriptan is metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme.  Eletriptan should not be used within at least 72 hours of treatment with the following potent CYP3A4 inhibitors: ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir and nelfinavir.  Eletriptan should not be used within 72 hours with drugs that have demonstrated potent CYP3A4 inhibition and have this potent effect described in the <a href="#Contraindications">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>, <a href="#Warnings">WARNINGS</a> or <a href="#Precautions">PRECAUTIONS</a> sections of their labeling (see <a href="#Warnings">WARNINGS</a> and <a href="#Drug_Interactions">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interactions</a>).</p>

<h1>PATIENT SUMMARY OF INFORMATION<br>RELPAX<span class="Sup">®</span><br>(eletriptan hydrobromide)</h1>
<p class="First">Please read this information before you start taking RELPAX and each time you renew your prescription. Remember, this summary does not take the place of discussions with your doctor. You and your doctor should discuss RELPAX when you start taking your medication and at regular checkups.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What is RELPAX?</span></p>
<p>RELPAX is a prescription medicine used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">migraine headaches</span> in adults. RELPAX is not for other types of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headaches</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What is a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">Migraine Headache</span>?</span></p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">Migraine</span> is an intense, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">throbbing headache</span>. You may have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> on one or both sides of your head.  You may have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, and be sensitive to light and noise. The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> and symptoms of a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">migraine headache</span> can be worse than a common <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>. Some women get <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">migraines</span> around the time of their menstrual period. Some people have visual symptoms before the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4206763" conceptname="Photopsia">flashing lights</span> or wavy lines, called an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4091160" conceptname="Aura">aura</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">How Does RELPAX Work?</span></p>
<p>Treatment with RELPAX reduces <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span> of blood vessels surrounding the brain. This <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span> is associated with the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> of a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">migraine</span> attack. RELPAX blocks the release of substances from nerve endings that cause more <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> and other symptoms like <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, and sensitivity to light and sound.</p>
<p>It is thought that these actions contribute to relief of your symptoms by RELPAX.</p>
