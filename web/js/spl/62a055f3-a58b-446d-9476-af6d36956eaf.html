<h1><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</span></h1>
<p class="First">Pentazocine is a Schedule IV opioid analgesic with agonist/antagonist action which when administered orally is approximately equivalent on a mg for mg basis in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span> to codeine.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen is an analgesic and antipyretic.</p>
<p>Pentazocine weakly antagonizes the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effects</span> of morphine, meperidine, and phenazocine; in addition, it produces incomplete reversal of cardiovascular, respiratory, and behavioral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> induced by morphine and meperidine.  Pentazocine has about 1/50 the antagonistic activity of nalorphine.  It also has sedative activity.</p>
<p>Onset of significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> with pentazocine usually occurs between 15 and 30 minutes after oral administration, and duration of action is usually three hours or longer.</p>
<p>Pentazocine is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.  Plasma levels closely correspond to the onset, duration, and intensity of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>.  The time to mean peak concentration in 24 normal volunteers was 1.7 hours (range 0.5 to 4 hours) after oral administration and the mean plasma elimination half-life was 3.6 hours (range 1.5 to 10 hours).</p>
<p>The action of pentazocine is terminated for the most part by biotransformation in the liver with some free pentazocine excreted in the urine.  The products of the oxidation of the terminal methyl groups and glucuronide conjugates are excreted by the kidney. Elimination of approximately 60% of the total dose occurs within 24 hours.  Pentazocine passes into fetal circulation.</p>
<p>Onset of significant analgesic and antipyretic activity of acetaminophen when administered orally occurs within 30 minutes and is maximal at approximately 2 1/2 hours.  The pharmacological mode of action of acetaminophen is unknown at this time.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.  In 24 normal volunteers the time to mean peak plasma concentration was 1 hour (range 0.25 to 3 hours) after oral administration and the mean plasma elimination half-life was 2.8 hours (range 2 to 4 hours).</p>
<p>The effect of pentazocine on acetaminophen plasma protein binding or vice versa has not been established.  For acetaminophen there is little or no plasma protein binding at normal therapeutic doses.  When toxic doses of acetaminophen are ingested and drug plasma levels exceed 90 mcg/mL, plasma binding may vary from 8% to 43%.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen is conjugated in the liver with glucuronic acid and to a lesser extent with sulfuric acid.  Approximately 80% of acetaminophen is excreted in the urine after conjugation and about 3% is excreted unchanged.  The drug is also conjugated to a lesser extent with cysteine and additionally metabolized by hydroxylation.</p>
<p>If pentazocine hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets are taken every 4 hours over an extended period of time, accumulation of pentazocine and to a lesser extent, acetaminophen, may occur.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">WARNINGS
</span></h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hepatotoxicity</span></p>
<p>Pentazocine hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets contain acetaminophen and pentazocine hydrochloride. Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4026032" conceptname="Acute hepatic failure">acute liver failure</span>, at times resulting in liver transplant and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. Most of the cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver injury</span> are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4000 milligrams per day, often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product. The excessive intake of acetaminophen may be intentional to cause self-harm or unintentional as patients attempt to obtain more <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relief or unknowingly take other acetaminophen-containing products.</p>
<p>The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4026032" conceptname="Acute hepatic failure">acute liver failure</span> is higher in individuals with underlying liver disease and in individuals who ingest alcohol while taking acetaminophen.</p>
<p>Instruct patients to look for acetaminophen or APAP on package labels and not to use more than one product that contains acetaminophen. Instruct patients to seek medical attention immediately upon ingestion of more than 4000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day, even if they feel well.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">Hypersensitivity</span>/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylaxis</span></span></p>
<p>There have been post-marketing reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylaxis</span> associated with use of acetaminophen.  Clinical signs included <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span> of the face, mouth, and throat, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4158346" conceptname="Respiratory distress">respiratory distress</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="139900" conceptname="Urticaria">urticaria</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>.  There were infrequent reports of life-threatening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylaxis</span> requiring emergent medical attention.  Instruct patients to discontinue pentazocine hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets immediately and seek medical care if they experience these symptoms.  Do not prescribe pentazocine hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets for patients with acetaminophen <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergy</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug Dependence</span></span></p>
<p>Pentazocine can cause a physical and psychological <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>. (See <a href="#b85e7bec-9860-48b4-a359-5e89492c4905">DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></a>.)</p>

<p>In the presence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375415" conceptname="Injury of head">head injury</span>, intracranial lesions or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure, the possible respiratory depressant effects of pentazocine and its potential to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure (resulting from vasodilation following CO2 retention) may be markedly increased. Furthermore, pentazocine can produce effects on pupillary response and consciousness, which may obscure neurologic signs of further increases in intracranial pressure in patients with head injuries.  In such patients, pentazocine hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets must be used with extreme caution and only if its use is deemed essential.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Interactions with Alcohol and Drugs of Abuse</span></p>
<p>Pentazocine may be expected to have additive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> because <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, profound sedation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> may result.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Patients Receiving Narcotics</span></p>
<p>Pentazocine is a mild narcotic antagonist. Some patients previously given narcotics, including methadone for the daily treatment of narcotic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>, have experienced withdrawal symptoms after receiving pentazocine.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">Respiratory Depression</span></span></p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">Respiratory depression</span> occurs more frequently in elderly or debilitated patients and in those suffering from conditions accompanied by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4105765" conceptname="Hypercapnia">hypercapnia</span>, or upper airway obstruction, in whom even moderate therapeutic doses may significantly decrease pulmonary ventilation.

<p><span class="Bold">Acute CNS Manifestations</span></p>
<p>Patients receiving therapeutic doses of pentazocine hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets have experienced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span> (usually visual), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4011527" conceptname="Spatial disorientation">disorientation</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> which have cleared spontaneously within a period of hours.  The mechanism of this reaction is not known.  Such patients should be closely observed and vital signs checked.  If the drug is reinstituted, it should be done with caution since these acute CNS manifestations may recur.</p>

</span></h2>
<p class="First">Pentazocine hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets are a Schedule IV controlled substance.</p>
<p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> and tolerance. Abuse is characterized by misuse of a drug for non-medical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. Addiction is a disease of repeated drug abuse. Addiction is a primary, chronic, neurobiologic disease, with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations. Addiction is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following: impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug addiction</span> is a treatable disease, utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common. Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> is a state of adaptation that is manifested by a specific withdrawal syndrome that can be produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, decreasing blood level of the drug, and/or administration of an antagonist. Tolerance is a state of adaptation in which exposure to a drug induces changes that result in a diminution of one or more of the drug’s effects over time. Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects.</p>
<p>Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> in all addicts.  In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction and is characterized by misuse of the drug for non-medical purposes, and often in combination with other psychoactive substances.</p>
<p>There have been some reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> and of withdrawal symptoms with pentazocine hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets. Patients with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">drug dependence</span> should be under close supervision while receiving pentazocine orally. There have been rare reports of possible abstinence syndromes in newborns after prolonged use of pentazocine during pregnancy.</p>
<p>There have been reports of development of addiction and physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> in patients receiving parenteral pentazocine. People with a history of drug abuse or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433753" conceptname="Alcohol abuse">alcohol abuse</span> may have a higher chance of becoming addicted to opioid medicines.</p>
<p>Abrupt dose cessation or rapid dose reduction following the extended use of parenteral pentazocine has resulted in withdrawal symptoms such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal cramps</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, elevated temperature, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4190045" conceptname="Rigor">chills</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4170297" conceptname="Sniffles">rhinorrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">restlessness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435553" conceptname="Epiphora">lacrimation</span>.  In general opioid therapy should not be abruptly discontinued. When the patient no longer requires treatment with pentazocine hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets, the drug should be tapered gradually to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in patients who have been receiving opioids for an extended period of time and might have become physically dependent.</p>
<p>In prescribing pentazocine hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets for chronic use, the physician should take under consideration that proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to identify and decrease misuse and abuse of opioid drugs.</p>
<p>Severe, even lethal, consequences may result from misuse of tablets by injection either alone or in combination with other substances, such as pulmonary emboli, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4093906" conceptname="Obstruction">vascular occlusion</span>, ulceration and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="444202" conceptname="Abscess">abscesses</span>, and withdrawal symptoms in narcotic dependent individuals.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">CNS Effect</span></p>
<p>Caution should be used when pentazocine hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets are administered to patients prone to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> have occurred in a few such patients in association with the use of pentazocine although no cause and effect relationship has been established.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4305376" conceptname="Porphyria">Porphyria</span></span></p>
<p>Particular caution should be exercised in administering pentazocine to patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4305376" conceptname="Porphyria">porphyria</span> since it may provoke an acute attack in susceptible individuals.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Cardiovascular Disease</span></p>
<p>Pentazocine can elevate blood pressure, possibly through the release of endogenous catecholamines. Particular caution should be exercised in conditions where alterations in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span> and blood pressure might be particularly undesirable, such as in the acute phase of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">Impaired Renal or Hepatic Function</span></p>
<p>Decreased metabolism of the drug by the liver in extensive liver disease may predispose to accentuation of side effects. Although laboratory tests have not indicated that pentazocine causes or increases renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>, the drug should be administered with caution to patients with such impairment.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen is metabolized by the liver, and has been associated with cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4026032" conceptname="Acute hepatic failure">acute liver failure</span>, at times resulting in liver transplant and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. Therefore, pentazocine hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets should be administered with caution to patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> and in individuals who ingest alcohol (See <a href="#b751f9d7-1c6a-4639-800b-a1233b40ad5c">BOXED WARNING</a> and <a href="#bd512acb-5205-4a0d-97fa-caac107f0bc1">WARNINGS</a>, <a href="#b697c1d9-cd55-403c-9cb8-6e8b7af18fe8">Hepatotoxicity</a>).</p>

<p><span class="Bold">Biliary Surgery</span></p>
<p>Narcotic drug products are generally considered to elevate biliary tract pressure for varying periods following their administration.  Some evidence suggests that pentazocine may differ from other marketed narcotics in this respect (i.e., it causes little or no elevation in biliary tract pressures). The clinical significance of these findings, however, is not yet known.</p>

Serum acetaminophen levels should be obtained immediately if the patient presents 4 hours or more after ingestion to assess potential risk of hepatotoxicity; acetaminophen levels drawn less then 4 hours post-ingestion may be misleading.  To obtain the best possible outcome, NAC should be administered as soon as possible where impending or evolving <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver injury</span> is suspected.  Intravenous NAC may be administered when circumstances preclude oral administration.</p>
<p>Vigorous supportive therapy is required in severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>.  Procedures to limit the continuing absorption of the drug must be readily performed since the hepatic injury is dose dependent and occurs early in the course of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>.</p>
