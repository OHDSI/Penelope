<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">IBU tablets contain the active ingredient ibuprofen, which is (Â±) -2 - (<span class="Italics">p</span> - isobutylphenyl) propionic acid. Ibuprofen is a white powde rwith a melting point of 74-77Â° C and is very slightly soluble in water(&lt;1 mg/mL) and readily soluble in organic solvents such as ethanol and acetone. The structural formula is represented below:</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">IBU tablets contain ibuprofen which possesses analgesic andantipyretic activities. Its mode of action, like that of other NSAIDs, isnot completely understood, but may be related to prostaglandin synthetaseinhibition.</p>
<p>In clinical studies in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> andosteoarthritis, Ibuprofen tablets have been shown to be comparableto aspirin in controlling <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> and to be associatedwith a statistically significant reduction in the milder gastrointestinalside effects (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_adverse_effects_id_945938cf-69b8-46fd-b80f-ab98e34d0790">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span>). Ibuprofen may be well toleratedin some patients who have had gastrointestinal side effectswith aspirin, but these patients when treated with IBU tablets shouldbe carefully followed for signs and symptoms of gastrointestinalulceration and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>. Although it is not definitely known whetheribuprofen causes less <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4027663" conceptname="Peptic ulcer">peptic ulceration</span> than aspirin, in one studyinvolving 885 patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> treated for up to oneyear, there were no reports of gastric ulceration with ibuprofenwhereas frank ulceration was reported in 13 patients in the aspiringroup (statistically significant p&lt;.001).</p>
<p>Gastroscopic studies at varying doses show an increased tendencytoward <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002232" conceptname="Epigastric discomfort">gastric irritation</span> at higher doses. However, at comparabledoses, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002232" conceptname="Epigastric discomfort">gastric irritation</span> is approximately half that seen with aspirin.Studies using 51Cr-tagged red cells indicate that fecal blood lossassociated with Ibuprofen tablets in doses up to 2400 mg daily didnot exceed the normal range, and was significantly less than thatseen in aspirin-treated patients.</p>
<p>In clinical studies in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span>, Ibuprofenhas been shown to be comparable to indomethacin in controlling thesigns and symptoms of disease activity and to be associated with astatistically significant reduction of the milder gastrointestinal (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_adverse_effects_id_945938cf-69b8-46fd-b80f-ab98e34d0790">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span>) and CNS side effects.</p>
<p>Ibuprofen may be used in combination with gold salts and/or corticosteroids.</p>
<p>Controlled studies have demonstrated that Ibuprofen is a more effective analgesic than propoxyphene for the relief of episiotomy <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> following dental extraction procedures, and for the relief ofthe symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194696" conceptname="Dysmenorrhea">primary dysmenorrhea</span>.</p>
<p>In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194696" conceptname="Dysmenorrhea">primary dysmenorrhea</span>, Ibuprofen has been shown to reduce elevated levels of prostaglandin activity in the menstrualfluid and to reduce resting and active intrauterine pressure, as well asthe frequency of uterine contractions. The probable mechanism ofaction is to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis rather than simply to provide <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>.</p>
<p>The ibuprofen in IBU tablets is rapidly absorbed. Peak serum ibuprofen levels are generally attained one to two hours after administration.With single doses up to 800 mg, a linear relationship exists between amount of drug administered and the integrated area underthe serum drug concentration vs time curve. Above 800 mg, however,the area under the curve increases less than proportional to increases in dose. There is no evidence of drug accumulation or enzyme induction.</p>
<p>The administration of Ibuprofen tablets either under fasting conditions or immediately before meals yields quite similar serum ibuprofen concentration-time profiles. When Ibuprofen is administered immediately after a meal, there is a reduction in the rate of absorption but no appreciable decrease in the extent of absorption.The bioavailability of the drug is minimally altered by the presence of food.</p>
<p>A bioavailability study has shown that there was no interference with the absorption of ibuprofen when given in conjunction with anantacid containing both aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide.</p>
<p>Ibuprofen is rapidly metabolized and eliminated in the urine. The excretion of ibuprofen is virtually complete 24 hours after the last dose. The serum half-life is 1.8 to 2.0 hours.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that following ingestion of the drug, 45% to79% of the dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours as metabolite A (25%), (+)-2-[<span class="Italics">p</span>-(2hydroxymethyl-propyl) phenyl] propionic acid and metabolite B (37%), (+)-2-[<span class="Italics">p</span>-(2carboxypropyl)phenyl]propionic acid; the percentages of free and conjugated ibuprofen were approximately 1% and 14%, respectively.</p>

<h3>Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</h3>
<p class="First">Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDsof up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of seriouscardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, andstroke, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective,may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease orrisk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize thepotential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with anNSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortestduration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for thedevelopment of such events, even in the absence of previous CVsymptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/orsymptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</p>
<p>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigatesthe increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associatedwith NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID doesincrease the risk of serious GI events (see <span class="Bold">GI <a href="#i4i_table_id_2a2589f5-4e9f-4349-8d01-46ee80859b54">WARNINGS)</a></span>.</p>

Patients takingthiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapieswhen taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including IBU tablets, should beused with caution in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>. Blood pressure (BP)should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID treatmentand throughout the course of therapy.</p>

<h3>Gastrointestinal Effects - Risk of Ulceration, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">Bleeding</span>, and Perforation</h3>
<p class="First">NSAIDs, including IBU tablets, can cause serious gastrointestinal(GI) adverse events including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcers</span>, gross <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patientstreated for 3-6 months, and in about 2-4% of patients treated for oneyear. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in thosewith a prior history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcer</span> disease or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">gastrointestinal bleeding</span>.Patients with a prior history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4027663" conceptname="Peptic ulcer">peptic ulcer disease</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">gastrointestinal bleeding</span> who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">GI bleed</span> compared to patients treatedwith neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the riskof GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GIulcerations and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI event is suspected.This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high-risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.</p>

<h3>Renal Effects</h3>
<p class="First">Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4152839" conceptname="Acute papillary necrosis">renal papillary necrosis</span> and other <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4220631" conceptname="Injury of kidney">renal injury</span>. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a NSAID may cause a dose dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest riskof this reaction are those with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>,liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">IBU tablets cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids orto treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroidsmay lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolongedcorticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if adecision is made to discontinue corticosteroids.</p>
<p>The pharmacological activity of IBU tablets in reducing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span> andinflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs indetecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.</p>

<h2>Hepatic effects</h2>
<p class="First">Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in upto 15% of patients taking NSAIDs, including IBU tablets. These laboratoryabnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or maybe transient with continuing therapy. Notable elevations of ALT orAST (approximately three or more times the upper limit of normal)have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trialswith NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic reactions,including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span>, fulminant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4337543" conceptname="Hepatic necrosis">liver necrosis</span>, and hepaticfailure, some of them with fatal outcomes have been reported. Apatient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, orwith abnormal liver test values, should be evaluated for evidence ofthe development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapywith IBU tablets. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liverdisease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g.,<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302954" conceptname="Disorder characterized by eosinophilia">eosinophilia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>, etc.), IBU tablets should be discontinued.</p>

<h2>Hematological effects</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">Anemia</span> is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs, includingIBU tablets. This may be due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4125002" conceptname="Idiopathic fluid retention">fluid retention</span>, occult or gross GIblood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis.Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including IBU tablets,should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibitany signs or symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span>.</p>
<p>In two postmarketing clinical studies the incidence of a decreasedhemoglobin level was greater than previously reported. Decrease inhemoglobin of 1 gram or more was observed in 17.1% of 193patients on 1600 mg ibuprofen daily (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80180" conceptname="Osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</span>), and in 22.8% of189 patients taking 2400 mg of ibuprofen daily (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span>).Positive stool occult blood tests and elevated serum creatinine levelswere also observed in these studies.</p>
<p>NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolongbleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect onplatelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible.</p>
<p>Patients receiving IBU tablets who may be adversely affected byalterations in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disordersor patients receiving anticoagulants should be carefully monitored.</p>

<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">Because serious GI tract ulcerations and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> can occur withoutwarning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs orsymptoms of GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>.

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">ACE-inhibitors:</span>Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensiveeffect of ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given considerationin patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Aspirin</span>When IBU tablets are administered with aspirin, its protein bindingis reduced, although the clearance of free IBU tablets is notaltered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however,as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of ibuprofenand aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential forincreased adverse effects.</p>

<h2>Diuretics</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies, as well as post marketing observations, haveshown that Ibuprofen tablets can reduce the natriuretic effect-offurosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has beenattributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitanttherapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closelyfor signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> (see PRECAUTIONS, Renal Effects), aswell as to assure diuretic efficacy.</p>

<h2>Lithium</h2>
<p class="First">Ibuprofen produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and areduction in renal lithium clearance in a study of eleven normal volunteers.The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%and the renal clearance of lithium was decreased by 19% during thisperiod of concomitant drug administration.This effect has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandinsynthesis by ibuprofen. Thus, when ibuprofen and lithium are administeredconcurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signsof <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium toxicity</span>. (Read circulars for lithium preparation before useof such concurrent therapy.)</p>

<h2>Methotrexate</h2>
<p class="First">NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexateaccumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they couldenhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used whenNSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.</p>

However, because <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> has been reported whenIBU tablets and other NSAIDs have been administered to patients oncoumarin-type anticoagulants, the physician should be cautiouswhen administering IBU tablets to patients on anticoagulants. Theeffects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> are synergistic, suchthat the users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleedinghigher than users of either drug alone.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">The most frequent type of adverse reaction occurring withIbuprofen tablets is gastrointestinal. In controlled clinical trials thepercentage of patients reporting one or more gastrointestinal complaintsranged from 4% to 16%.</p>
<p>In controlled studies when Ibuprofen tablets were compared toaspirin and indomethacin in equally effective doses, the overall incidenceof gastrointestinal complaints was about half that seen in eitherthe aspirin- or indomethacin-treated patients.</p>
<p>Adverse reactions observed during controlled clinical trials at anincidence greater than 1% are listed in the table. Those reactions listedin Column one encompass observations in approximately 3,000patients. More than 500 of these patients were treated for periods ofat least 54 weeks.</p>
<p>Still other reactions occurring less frequently than 1 in 100 werereported in controlled clinical trials and from marketing experience.These reactions have been divided into two categories: Column twoof the table lists reactions with therapy with Ibuprofen tablets wherethe probability of a causal relationship exists: for the reactions inColumn three, a causal relationship with Ibuprofen tablets has notbeen established.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Approximately 11â?„2 hours after the reported ingestion of from 7 to10 Ibuprofen tablets (400 mg), a 19-month old child weighing 12 kgwas seen in the hospital emergency room, apneic and cyanotic,responding only to painful stimuli. This type of stimulus, however,was sufficient to induce respiration. Oxygen and parenteral fluidswere given; a greenish-yellow fluid was aspirated from the stomachwith no evidence to indicate the presence of ibuprofen. Two hoursafter ingestion the childâ€™s condition seemed stable; she still respondedonly to painful stimuli and continued to have periods of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span> lastingfrom 5 to 10 seconds. She was admitted to intensive care andsodium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span> was administered as well as infusions of dextroseand normal saline.

At 12 hours she appeared to be completelyrecovered.</p>
<p>In two other reported cases where children (each weighingapproximately 10 kg) accidentally, acutely ingested approximately120 mg/kg, there were no signs of acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> or late sequelae.Blood level in one child 90 minutes after ingestion was 700 Î¼g/mL â€”about 10 times the peak levels seen in absorption-excretion studies.A 19-year old male who had taken 8,000 mg of ibuprofen over aperiod of a few hours complained of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378165" conceptname="Nystagmus">nystagmus</span> wasnoted.

<p>In cases of acute overdosage, the stomach should be emptied byvomiting or lavage, though little drug will likely be recovered if morethan an hour has elapsed since ingestion. Because the drug is acidicand is excreted in the urine, it is theoretically beneficial to administeralkali and induce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span>. In addition to supportive measures, the useof oral activated charcoal may help to reduce the absorption andreabsorption of Ibuprofen tablets.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of IBU tabletsand other treatment options before deciding to use IBU tablets. Usethe lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent withindividual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).</p>
<p>After observing the response to initial therapy with IBU tablets, thedose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patientâ€™sneeds.Do not exceed 3200 mg total daily dose. If gastrointestinal complaintsoccur, administer IBU tablets with meals or milk.</p>

<p class="First">Suggested Dosage: 1200 mg-3200 mg daily (400 mg, 600 mg or800 mg tid or qid). Individual patients may show a better responseto 3200 mg daily, as compared with 2400 mg, although in well-controlledclinical trials patients on 3200 mg did not show a better meanresponse in terms of efficacy. Therefore, when treating patients with3200 mg/day, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinicalbenefits to offset potential increased risk.The dose should be tailored to each patient, and may be loweredor raised depending on the severity of symptoms either at time of initiatingdrug therapy or as the patient responds or fails to respond.In general, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> seem to require higherdoses of IBU tablets than do patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80180" conceptname="Osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</span>.</p>
<p>The smallest dose of IBU tablets that yields acceptable controlshould be employed. A linear blood level dose-response relationshipexists with single doses up to 800 mg (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGYfor effects of food on rate of absorption).</p>
<p>The availability of three tablet strengths facilitates dosage adjustment.In chronic conditions, a therapeutic response to therapy with IBU tablets is sometimes seen in a few days to a week but most often isobserved by two weeks. After a satisfactory response has beenachieved, the patientâ€™s dose should be reviewed and adjusted asrequired.</p>
