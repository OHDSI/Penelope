<ul>
<li>Pregnancy. Finasteride use is contraindicated in women when they are or may potentially be pregnant. Because of the ability of Type II 5α-reductase inhibitors to inhibit the conversion of testosterone to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), finasteride may cause abnormalities of the external genitalia of a male fetus of a pregnant woman who receives finasteride. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if pregnancy occurs while taking this drug, the pregnant woman should be apprised of the potential hazard to the male fetus. <span class="Italics">[See<a href="#S5.1"> Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</a>,<a href="#S8.1"> Use in Specific Populations (8.1)</a>,</span><span class="Italics"><a href="#S16"> How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) </a>and<a href="#S17.1"> Patient Counseling Information (17.1)</a>.]</span> In female rats, low doses of finasteride administered during pregnancy have produced abnormalities of the external genitalia in male offspring.</li>

<a name="S5.1"></a><a name="section-5.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>5.1 Exposure of Women — Risk to Male Fetus</h2>
<p class="First">PROPECIA is not indicated for use in women. Women should not handle crushed or broken PROPECIA tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. PROPECIA tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. <span class="Italics">[See<a href="#S1"> Indications and Usage (1)</a>,<a href="#S4"> Contraindications (4)</a>,<a href="#S8.1"> Use in Specific Populations (8.1)</a>,<a href="#S16"> How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) </a>and<a href="#S17.1"> Patient Counseling Information (17.1)</a>.]</span></p>

<h2>5.2	Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)</h2>
<p class="First">In clinical studies with PROPECIA (finasteride, 1 mg) in men 18-41 years of age, the mean value of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) decreased from 0.7 ng/mL at baseline to 0.5 ng/mL at Month 12. Further, in clinical studies with PROSCAR (finasteride, 5 mg) when used in older men who have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198803" conceptname="Benign prostatic hyperplasia">benign prostatic hyperplasia</span> (BPH), PSA levels are decreased by approximately 50%. Other studies with PROSCAR showed it may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. These findings should be taken into account for proper interpretation of serum PSA when evaluating men treated with finasteride. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on PROPECIA may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance to therapy with PROPECIA may also affect PSA test results.</p>

<h2>5.3	Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer with 5α-Reductase Inhibitors</h2>
<p class="First" style="border-left:1px solid;"><span class="XmChange">Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA ≤3.0 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day (5 times the dose of PROPECIA) in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). <span class="Italics">[See<a href="#S6.1"> Adverse Reactions (6.1)</a></span>.<span class="Italics">]</span> Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established.</span></p>

<p>Integrated analysis of clinical adverse experiences showed that during treatment with PROPECIA, 36 (3.8%) of 945 men had reported one or more of these adverse experiences as compared to 20 (2.1%) of 934 men treated with placebo (p=0.04). Resolution occurred in men who discontinued therapy with PROPECIA due to these side effects and in most of those who continued therapy. The incidence of each of the above adverse experiences decreased to ≤0.3% by the fifth year of treatment with PROPECIA.</p>
<p>In a study of finasteride 1 mg daily in healthy men, a median decrease in ejaculate volume of 0.3 mL (-11%) compared with 0.2 mL (-8%) for placebo was observed after 48 weeks of treatment. Two other studies showed that finasteride at 5 times the dosage of PROPECIA (5 mg daily) produced significant median decreases of approximately 0.5 mL (-25%) compared to placebo in ejaculate volume, but this was reversible after discontinuation of treatment.</p>

<p>The adverse experience profiles in the 1-year, placebo-controlled, Phase III BPH studies and the 5-year open extensions with PROSCAR 5 mg and PLESS were similar.</p>
<p>There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with PROSCAR 5 mg. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy.</p>
<p>During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with PROSCAR but no cases in men not treated with PROSCAR. During the 4-year placebo-controlled PLESS study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men, but no cases were reported in men treated with PROSCAR.</p>
<p>During the 7-year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with PROSCAR, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown.</p>
<p>The PCPT trial was a 7-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 healthy men ≥55 years of age with a normal digital rectal examination and a PSA ≤3.0 ng/mL. Men received either PROSCAR (finasteride 5 mg) or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%). In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor [AVODART (dutasteride)], similar results for Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). The clinical significance of these findings with respect to use of PROPECIA by men is unknown.</p>
<p>No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with PROSCAR. PROSCAR is not approved to reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer.</p>

<p class="First">Pregnancy Category X <span class="Italics">[see</span><span class="Italics"><a href="#S4"> Contraindications (4)</a>].</span> PROPECIA is contraindicated for use in women who are or may become pregnant. PROPECIA is a Type II 5α-reductase inhibitor that prevents conversion of testosterone to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone necessary for normal development of male genitalia. In animal studies, finasteride caused abnormal development of external genitalia in male fetuses. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the male fetus.</p>
<p>Abnormal male genital development is an expected consequence when conversion of testosterone to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is inhibited by 5α-reductase inhibitors. These outcomes are similar to those reported in male infants with genetic 5α-reductase deficiency. Women could be exposed to finasteride through contact with crushed or broken PROPECIA tablets or semen from a male partner taking PROPECIA. With regard to finasteride exposure through the skin, PROPECIA tablets are coated and will prevent skin contact with finasteride during normal handling if the tablets have not been crushed or broken. Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant should not handle crushed or broken PROPECIA tablets because of possible exposure of a male fetus. If a pregnant woman comes in contact with crushed or broken PROPECIA tablets, the contact area should be washed immediately with soap and water. With regard to potential finasteride exposure through semen, a study has been conducted in men receiving PROPECIA 1 mg/day that measured finasteride concentrations in semen <span class="Italics">[see<a href="#S12.3"> Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</a>].</span></p>
<p>In an embryo-fetal development study, pregnant rats received finasteride during the period of major organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 17). At maternal doses of oral finasteride approximately 1 to 684 times the recommended human dose (RHD) of 1 mg/day (based on AUC at animal doses of 0.1 to 100 mg/kg/day) there was a dose-dependent increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196528" conceptname="Hypospadias">hypospadias</span> that occurred in 3.6 to 100% of male offspring. Exposure multiples were estimated using data from nonpregnant rats. Days 16 to 17 of gestation is a critical period in male fetal rats for differentiation of the external genitalia. At oral maternal doses approximately 0.2 times the RHD (based on AUC at animal dose of 0.03 mg/kg/day), male offspring had decreased prostatic and seminal vesicular weights, delayed preputial separation and transient nipple development. Decreased anogenital distance occurred in male offspring of pregnant rats that received approximately 0.02 times the RHD (based on AUC at animal dose of 0.003 mg/kg/day). No abnormalities were observed in female offspring exposed to any dose of finasteride <span class="Italics">in utero</span>.</p>
<p>No developmental abnormalities were observed in the offspring of untreated females mated with finasteride-treated male rats that received approximately 488 times the RHD (based on AUC at animal dose of 80 mg/kg/day). Slightly decreased fertility was observed in male offspring after administration of about 20 times the RHD (based on AUC at animal dose of 3 mg/kg/day) to female rats during late gestation and lactation. No effects on fertility were seen in female offspring under these conditions.</p>
<p>No evidence of male external <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4291794" conceptname="Congenital absence of cervix">genital malformations</span> or other abnormalities were observed in rabbit fetuses exposed to finasteride during the period of major organogenesis (gestation days 6-18) at maternal doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (finasteride exposure levels were not measured in rabbits). However, this study may not have included the critical period for finasteride effects on development of male external genitalia in the rabbit.</p>
<p>The fetal effects of maternal finasteride exposure during the period of embryonic and fetal development were evaluated in the rhesus monkey (gestation days 20-100), in a species and development period more predictive of specific effects in humans than the studies in rats and rabbits. Intravenous administration of finasteride to pregnant monkeys at doses as high as 800 ng/day (estimated maximal blood concentration of 1.86 ng/mL or about 930 times the highest estimated exposure of pregnant women to finasteride from semen of men taking 1 mg/day) resulted in no abnormalities in male fetuses. In confirmation of the relevance of the rhesus model for human fetal development, oral administration of a dose of finasteride (2  mg/kg/day or approximately 120,000 times the highest estimated blood levels of finasteride from semen of men taking 1 mg/day) to pregnant monkeys resulted in external genital abnormalities in male fetuses. No other abnormalities were observed in male fetuses and no finasteride-related abnormalities were observed in female fetuses at any dose.</p>

<a name="S12.1"></a><a name="section-11.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>12.1	Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Finasteride is a competitive and specific inhibitor of Type II 5α-reductase, an intracellular enzyme that converts the androgen testosterone into DHT. Two distinct isozymes are found in mice, rats, monkeys, and humans: Type I and II. Each of these isozymes is differentially expressed in tissues and developmental stages. In humans, Type I 5α-reductase is predominant in the sebaceous glands of most regions of skin, including scalp, and liver. Type I 5α-reductase is responsible for approximately one-third of circulating DHT. The Type II 5α-reductase isozyme is primarily found in prostate, seminal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443720" conceptname="Blister">vesicles</span>, epididymides, and hair follicles as well as liver, and is responsible for two-thirds of circulating DHT.</p>
<p>In humans, the mechanism of action of finasteride is based on its preferential inhibition of the Type II isozyme. Using native tissues (scalp and prostate), <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> binding studies examining the potential of finasteride to inhibit either isozyme revealed a 100-fold selectivity for the human Type II 5α-reductase over Type I isozyme (IC<span class="Sub">50</span>=500 and 4.2 nM for Type I and II, respectively). For both isozymes, the inhibition by finasteride is accompanied by reduction of the inhibitor to dihydrofinasteride and adduct formation with NADP+. The turnover for the enzyme complex is slow (t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> approximately 30 days for the Type II enzyme complex and 14 days for the Type I complex). Inhibition of Type II 5α-reductase blocks the peripheral conversion of testosterone to DHT, resulting in significant decreases in serum and tissue DHT concentrations.</p>
<p>In men with male pattern <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133280" conceptname="Alopecia">hair loss</span> (androgenetic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133280" conceptname="Alopecia">alopecia</span>), the balding scalp contains miniaturized hair follicles and increased amounts of DHT compared with hairy scalp. Administration of finasteride decreases scalp and serum DHT concentrations in these men. The relative contributions of these reductions to the treatment effect of finasteride have not been defined. By this mechanism, finasteride appears to interrupt a key factor in the development of androgenetic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133280" conceptname="Alopecia">alopecia</span> in those patients genetically predisposed.</p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="43681-6">

<h2>12.2	Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">Finasteride produces a rapid reduction in serum DHT concentration, reaching 65% suppression within 24 hours of oral dosing with a 1-mg tablet. Mean circulating levels of testosterone and estradiol were increased by approximately 15% as compared to baseline, but these remained within the physiologic range.</p>
<p>Finasteride has no affinity for the androgen receptor and has no androgenic, antiandrogenic, estrogenic, antiestrogenic, or progestational effects. In studies with finasteride, no clinically meaningful changes in luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) or prolactin were detected. In healthy volunteers, treatment with finasteride did not alter the response of LH and FSH to gonadotropin-releasing hormone indicating that the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis was not affected. Finasteride had no effect on circulating levels of cortisol, thyroid-stimulating hormone, or thyroxine, nor did it affect the plasma lipid profile (e.g., total <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>, low-density lipoproteins, high-density lipoproteins and triglycerides) or bone mineral density.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></p>
<p>In a study in 15 healthy young male subjects, the mean bioavailability of finasteride 1-mg tablets was 65% (range 26-170%), based on the ratio of area under the curve (AUC) relative to an intravenous (IV) reference dose. At steady state following dosing with 1 mg/day (n=12), maximum finasteride plasma concentration averaged 9.2 ng/mL (range, 4.9-13.7 ng/mL) and was reached 1 to 2 hours postdose; AUC<span class="Sub">(0-24 hr)</span> was 53 ng∙hr/mL (range, 20-154 ng∙hr/mL). Bioavailability of finasteride was not affected by food.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></p>
<p>Mean steady-state volume of distribution was 76 liters (range, 44-96 liters; n=15). Approximately 90% of circulating finasteride is bound to plasma proteins. There is a slow accumulation phase for finasteride after multiple dosing.</p>
<p>Finasteride has been found to cross the blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p>Semen levels have been measured in 35 men taking finasteride 1 mg/day for 6 weeks. In 60% (21 of 35) of the samples, finasteride levels were undetectable (&lt;0.2 ng/mL). The mean finasteride level was 0.26 ng/mL and the highest level measured was 1.52 ng/mL. Using the highest semen level measured and assuming 100% absorption from a 5-mL ejaculate per day, human exposure through vaginal absorption would be up to 7.6 ng per day, which is 650-fold less than the dose of finasteride (5 µg) that had no effect on circulating DHT levels in men. <span class="Italics">[See<a href="#S8.1"> Use in Specific Populations (8.1)</a></span>.<span class="Italics">]</span></p>

<h2>13.1	Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">No evidence of a tumorigenic effect was observed in a 24-month study in Sprague-Dawley rats receiving doses of finasteride up to 160 mg/kg/day in males and 320 mg/kg/day in females. These doses produced respective systemic exposure in rats of 888 and 2192 times those observed in man receiving the recommended human dose of 1 mg/day. All exposure calculations were based on calculated AUC<span class="Sub">(0-24 hr)</span> for animals and mean AUC<span class="Sub">(0-24 hr)</span> for man (0.05 µg∙hr/mL).</p>
<p>In a 19-month carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, a statistically significant (p≤0.05) increase in the incidence of testicular Leydig cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> was observed at 1824 times the human exposure (250 mg/kg/day). In mice at 184 times the human exposure, estimated (25 mg/kg/day) and in rats at 312 times the human exposure (≥40 mg/kg/day) an increase in the incidence of Leydig cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4296894" conceptname="Hyperplasia">hyperplasia</span> was observed. A positive correlation between the proliferative changes in the Leydig cells and an increase in serum LH levels (2- to 3-fold above control) has been demonstrated in both rodent species treated with high doses of finasteride. No drug-related Leydig cell changes were seen in either rats or dogs treated with finasteride for 1 year at 240 and 2800 times (20 mg/kg/day and 45 mg/kg/day, respectively), or in mice treated for 19 months at 18.4 times the human exposure, estimated (2.5 mg/kg/day).</p>
<p>No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in an <span class="Italics">in </span><span class="Italics">vitro</span> bacterial mutagenesis assay, a mammalian cell mutagenesis assay, or in an <span class="Italics">in </span><span class="Italics">vitro</span> alkaline elution assay. In an <span class="Italics">in </span><span class="Italics">vitro</span> chromosome aberration assay, using Chinese hamster ovary cells, there was a slight increase in chromosome aberrations. In an <span class="Italics">in </span><span class="Italics">vivo</span> chromosome aberration assay in mice, no treatment-related increase in chromosome aberration was observed with finasteride at the maximum tolerated dose of 250 mg/kg/day (1824 times the human exposure) as determined in the carcinogenicity studies.</p>
<p>In sexually mature male rabbits treated with finasteride at 4344 times the human exposure (80 mg/kg/day) for up to 12 weeks, no effect on fertility, sperm count, or ejaculate volume was seen. In sexually mature male rats treated with 488 times the human exposure (80 mg/kg/day), there were no significant effects on fertility after 6 or 12 weeks of treatment; however, when treatment was continued for up to 24 or 30 weeks, there was an apparent decrease in fertility, fecundity, and an associated significant decrease in the weights of the seminal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443720" conceptname="Blister">vesicles</span> and prostate. All these effects were reversible within 6 weeks of discontinuation of treatment. No drug-related effect on testes or on mating performance has been seen in rats or rabbits. This decrease in fertility in finasteride-treated rats is secondary to its effect on accessory sex organs (prostate and seminal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443720" conceptname="Blister">vesicles</span>) resulting in failure to form a seminal plug. The seminal plug is essential for normal fertility in rats but is not relevant in man.</p>

<h2>14.1	Studies in Men</h2>
<p class="First">The efficacy of PROPECIA was demonstrated in men (88% Caucasian) with mild to moderate androgenetic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133280" conceptname="Alopecia">alopecia</span> (male pattern <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133280" conceptname="Alopecia">hair loss</span>) between 18 and 41 years of age. In order to prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137053" conceptname="Seborrheic dermatitis">seborrheic dermatitis</span> which might confound the assessment of hair growth in these studies, all men, whether treated with finasteride or placebo, were instructed to use a specified, medicated, tar-based shampoo (Neutrogena T/Gel®<a name="footnote-reference-3" href="#footnote-3" class="Sup">1</a> Shampoo) during the first 2 years of the studies.</p>
<p>There were three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies of 12-month duration. The two primary endpoints were hair count and patient self-assessment; the two secondary endpoints were investigator assessment and ratings of photographs. In addition, information was collected regarding sexual function (based on a self-administered questionnaire) and non-scalp body hair growth. The three studies were conducted in 1879 men with mild to moderate, but not complete, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133280" conceptname="Alopecia">hair loss</span>. Two of the studies enrolled men with predominantly mild to moderate vertex <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133280" conceptname="Alopecia">hair loss</span> (n=1553). The third enrolled men having mild to moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133280" conceptname="Alopecia">hair loss</span> in the anterior mid-scalp area with or without vertex balding (n=326).</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Studies in Men with Vertex <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133280" conceptname="Alopecia">Baldness</span></span></p>
<p>Of the men who completed the first 12 months of the two vertex <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133280" conceptname="Alopecia">baldness</span> trials, 1215 elected to continue in double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-month extension studies. There were 547 men receiving PROPECIA for both the initial study and first extension periods (up to 2 years of treatment) and 60 men receiving placebo for the same periods. The extension studies were continued for 3 additional years, with 323 men on PROPECIA and 23 on placebo entering the fifth year of the study.</p>
<p>In order to evaluate the effect of discontinuation of therapy, there were 65 men who received PROPECIA for the initial 12 months followed by placebo in the first 12-month extension period. Some of these men continued in additional extension studies and were switched back to treatment with PROPECIA, with 32 men entering the fifth year of the study. Lastly, there were 543 men who received placebo for the initial 12 months followed by PROPECIA in the first 12-month extension period. Some of these men continued in additional extension studies receiving PROPECIA, with 290 men entering the fifth year of the study (see<a href="#fig1"> Figure 1 </a>below).</p>
<p>Hair counts were assessed by photographic enlargements of a representative area of active <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133280" conceptname="Alopecia">hair loss</span>. In these two studies in men with vertex <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133280" conceptname="Alopecia">baldness</span>, significant increases in hair count were demonstrated at 6 and 12 months in men treated with PROPECIA, while significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133280" conceptname="Alopecia">hair loss</span> from baseline was demonstrated in those treated with placebo. At 12 months there was a 107-hair difference from placebo (p&lt;0.001, PROPECIA [n=679] vs placebo [n=672]) within a 1-inch diameter circle (5.1 cm<span class="Sup">2</span>). Hair count was maintained in those men taking PROPECIA for up to 2 years, resulting in a 138-hair difference between treatment groups (p&lt;0.001, PROPECIA [n=433] vs placebo [n=47]) within the same area. In men treated with PROPECIA, the maximum improvement in hair count compared to baseline was achieved during the first 2 years. Although the initial improvement was followed by a slow decline, hair count was maintained above baseline throughout the 5 years of the studies. Furthermore, because the decline in the placebo group was more rapid, the difference between treatment groups also continued to increase throughout the studies, resulting in a 277-hair difference (p&lt;0.001, PROPECIA [n=219] vs placebo [n=15]) at 5 years (see<a href="#fig1"> Figure 1 </a>below).</p>
<p>Patients who switched from placebo to PROPECIA (n=425) had a decrease in hair count at the end of the initial 12-month placebo period, followed by an increase in hair count after 1 year of treatment with PROPECIA. This increase in hair count was less (56 hairs above original baseline) than the increase (91 hairs above original baseline) observed after 1 year of treatment in men initially randomized to PROPECIA. Although the increase in hair count, relative to when therapy was initiated, was comparable between these two groups, a higher absolute hair count was achieved in patients who were started on treatment with PROPECIA in the initial study. This advantage was maintained through the remaining 3 years of the studies. A change of treatment from PROPECIA to placebo (n=48) at the end of the initial 12 months resulted in reversal of the increase in hair count 12 months later, at 24 months (see<a href="#fig1"> Figure 1 </a>below).</p>
<p>At 12 months, 58% of men in the placebo group had further <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133280" conceptname="Alopecia">hair loss</span> (defined as any decrease in hair count from baseline), compared with 14% of men treated with PROPECIA. In men treated for up to 2 years, 72% of men in the placebo group demonstrated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133280" conceptname="Alopecia">hair loss</span>, compared with 17% of men treated with PROPECIA. At 5 years, 100% of men in the placebo group demonstrated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133280" conceptname="Alopecia">hair loss</span>, compared with 35% of men treated with PROPECIA.</p>

<p>Patient self-assessment was obtained at each clinic visit from a self-administered questionnaire, which included questions on their perception of hair growth, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133280" conceptname="Alopecia">hair loss</span>, and appearance. This self-assessment demonstrated an increase in amount of hair, a decrease in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133280" conceptname="Alopecia">hair loss</span>, and improvement in appearance in men treated with PROPECIA. Overall improvement compared with placebo was seen as early as 3 months (p&lt;0.05), with improvement maintained over 5 years.</p>
<p>Investigator assessment was based on a 7-point scale evaluating increases or decreases in scalp hair at each patient visit. This assessment showed significantly greater increases in hair growth in men treated with PROPECIA compared with placebo as early as 3 months (p&lt;0.001). At 12 months, the investigators rated 65% of men treated with PROPECIA as having increased hair growth compared with 37% in the placebo group. At 2 years, the investigators rated 80% of men treated with PROPECIA as having increased hair growth compared with 47% of men treated with placebo. At 5 years, the investigators rated 77% of men treated with PROPECIA as having increased hair growth, compared with 15% of men treated with placebo.</p>
<p>An independent panel rated standardized photographs of the head in a blinded fashion based on increases or decreases in scalp hair using the same 7-point scale as the investigator assessment. At 12 months, 48% of men treated with PROPECIA had an increase as compared with 7% of men treated with placebo. At 2 years, an increase in hair growth was demonstrated in 66% of men treated with PROPECIA, compared with 7% of men treated with placebo. At 5 years, 48% of men treated with PROPECIA demonstrated an increase in hair growth, 42% were rated as having no change (no further visible progression of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133280" conceptname="Alopecia">hair loss</span> from baseline) and 10% were rated as having lost hair when compared to baseline. In comparison, 6% of men treated with placebo demonstrated an increase in hair growth, 19% were rated as having no change and 75% were rated as having lost hair when compared to baseline.</p>
<p>A 48-week, placebo-controlled study designed to assess by phototrichogram the effect of PROPECIA on total and actively growing (anagen) scalp hairs in vertex <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133280" conceptname="Alopecia">baldness</span> enrolled 212 men with androgenetic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133280" conceptname="Alopecia">alopecia</span>. At baseline and 48 weeks, total and anagen hair counts were obtained in a 1-cm<span class="Sup">2 </span>target area of the scalp. Men treated with PROPECIA showed increases from baseline in total and anagen hair counts of 7 hairs and 18 hairs, respectively, whereas men treated with placebo had decreases of 10 hairs and 9 hairs, respectively. These changes in hair counts resulted in a between-group difference of 17 hairs in total hair count (p&lt;0.001) and 27 hairs in anagen hair count (p&lt;0.001), and an improvement in the proportion of anagen hairs from 62% at baseline to 68% for men treated with PROPECIA.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">What are the possible side effects of PROPECIA?</span></p>
<ul class="Disc">
<li>
<span class="Bold">decrease in your blood Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) levels. </span>PROPECIA can affect a blood test called PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen) for the screening of prostate cancer. If you have a PSA test done you should tell your healthcare provider that you are taking PROPECIA because PROPECIA decreases PSA levels. Changes in PSA levels will need to be evaluated by your healthcare provider. Any increase in follow-up PSA levels from their lowest point may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if the test results are still within the normal range for men not taking PROPECIA. You should also tell your healthcare provider if you have not been taking PROPECIA as prescribed because this may affect the PSA test results. For more information, talk to your healthcare provider.</li>
<li>There may be an increased risk of a more serious form of prostate cancer in men taking finasteride at 5 times the dose of PROPECIA.</li>
</ul>
