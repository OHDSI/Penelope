<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Calcitonin is a polypeptide hormone secreted by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland in mammals and by the ultimobranchial gland of birds and fish.</p>
<p>The active ingredient in FORTICAL<span class="Sup">®</span> calcitonin-salmon (rDNA origin) Nasal Spray is a polypeptide of 32 amino acids manufactured by recombinant DNA technology and is identical to calcitonin-salmon produced by chemical synthesis.</p>
<p>This is shown by the following graphic formula:</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Calcitonin acts primarily on bone, but direct renal effects and actions on the gastrointestinal tract are also recognized. Calcitonin-salmon appears to have actions essentially identical to calcitonins of mammalian origin, but its potency per mg is greater and it has a longer duration of action.</p>
<p>The information below, describing the clinical pharmacology of calcitonin, has been derived from studies with <span class="Italics">injectable</span> calcitonin. The mean bioavailability of calcitonin-salmon nasal spray is approximately 3% of the injectable calcitonin in normal subjects and, therefore, the conclusions concerning the <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span> of this preparation may be different.</p>
<p>The actions of calcitonin on bone and its role in normal human bone physiology are still not completely elucidated, although calcitonin receptors have been discovered in osteoclasts and osteoblasts.</p>
<p>Single injections of calcitonin cause a marked transient inhibition of the ongoing bone resorptive process. With prolonged use, there is a persistent, smaller decrease in the rate of bone resorption. Histologically, this is associated with a decreased number of osteoclasts and an apparent decrease in their resorptive activity. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies have shown that calcitonin-salmon causes inhibition of osteoclast function with loss of the ruffled osteoclast border responsible for resorption of bone. This activity resumes following removal of calcitonin-salmon from the test system. There is some evidence from <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies that bone formation may be augmented by calcitonin through increased osteoblastic activity.</p>
<p>Animal studies indicate that endogenous calcitonin, primarily through its action on bone, participates with parathyroid hormone in the homeostatic regulation of blood calcium. Thus, high blood calcium levels cause increased secretion of calcitonin which, in turn, inhibits bone resorption. This reduces the transfer of calcium from bone to blood and tends to return blood calcium towards the normal level. The importance of this process in humans has not been determined. In normal adults, who have a relatively low rate of bone resorption, the administration of exogenous calcitonin results in only a slight decrease in serum calcium in the limits of the normal range. In normal children and in patients with Paget's disease in whom bone resorption is more rapid, decreases in serum calcium are more pronounced in response to calcitonin.</p>
<p>Bone biopsy and radial bone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> studies at baseline and after 26 months of daily injectable calcitonin indicate that calcitonin therapy results in the formation of normal bone.</p>

<h2>Calcium Homeostasis</h2>
<p class="First">In two clinical studies designed to evaluate the pharmacodynamic response to calcitonin-salmon nasal spray, administration of 100-1600 International Units to healthy volunteers resulted in rapid and sustained small decreases (but still within the normal range) in both total serum calcium and serum <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4125860" conceptname="Calcium electrolyte">ionized calcium</span>. Single doses greater than 400 International Units did not produce any further biological response to the drug.

<h2>Kidney</h2>
<p class="First">Studies with injectable calcitonin show increases in the excretion of filtered phosphate, calcium, and sodium by decreasing their tubular reabsorption. Comparable studies have not been conducted with FORTICAL<span class="Sup">®</span> calcitonin-salmon (rDNA origin) Nasal Spray.</p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-3.4"></a><p></p>
<h2>Gastrointestinal Tract</h2>
<p class="First">Some evidence from studies with injectable preparations suggests that calcitonin may have significant actions on the gastrointestinal tract. Short-term administration of injectable calcitonin results in marked transient decreases in the volume and acidity of gastric juice and in the volume and the trypsin and amylase content of pancreatic juice. Whether these effects continue to be elicited after each injection of calcitonin during chronic therapy has not been investigated. These studies have not been conducted with FORTICAL<span class="Sup">®</span> calcitonin-salmon (rDNA origin) Nasal Spray.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism</h2>
<p class="First">The pharmacokinetic properties of FORTICAL<span class="Sup">®</span> calcitonin-salmon (rDNA origin) Nasal Spray after multiple dose administration were shown to be similar to that of a commercially available calcitonin-salmon product in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of calcitonin-salmon nasal spray relative to intramuscular administration is between 3 and 5%. Calcitonin-salmon nasal spray is absorbed by the nasal mucosa with a mean Tmax of about 13 minutes. The terminal half-life of calcitonin-salmon has been calculated to be around 18 minutes and no evidence of accumulation was observed with multiple dosing. Plasma exposure was higher following administration of 400 IU nasal spray compared to that after 200 IU dose. As is the case with other polypeptide hormones, there is very little value in monitoring plasma levels of salmon calcitonin since these are not directly predictive of the therapeutic response. Hence, Fortical<span class="Sup">®</span> activity should be evaluated by using clinical parameters of efficacy.</p>

<h2>Postmenopausal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">Osteoporosis</span></h2>
<p class="First">FORTICAL<span class="Sup">®</span> calcitonin-salmon (rDNA origin) Nasal Spray is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> in women greater than 5 years postmenopause with low bone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> relative to healthy premenopausal women. Use of FORTICAL<span class="Sup">®</span> calcitonin-salmon (rDNA origin) Nasal Spray is recommended in conjunction with an adequate calcium (at least 1000 mg elemental calcium per day) and Vitamin D (400 International Units per day) intake to retard the progressive loss of bone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span>. The evidence of efficacy for calcitonin-salmon is based on increases in spinal bone mineral density (BMD) observed in clinical trials.</p>
<p>Two randomized, placebo-controlled trials were conducted in 325 postmenopausal women (227 treated with calcitonin-salmon nasal spray and 98 treated with placebo) with spinal, forearm or femoral BMD at least one standard deviation below the normal value for healthy premenopausal women. These studies conducted over two years demonstrated that 200 International Units daily of calcitonin-salmon nasal spray increases lumbar vertebral BMD relative to baseline and relative to placebo in osteoporotic women who were greater than 5 years postmenopause. Calcitonin-salmon nasal spray produced statistically significant increases in lumbar vertebral BMD compared to placebo as early as 6 months after initiation of therapy with persistence of this level for up to 2 years of observation.</p>
<p>No effects of calcitonin-salmon nasal spray on cortical bone of the forearm or hip were demonstrated. However, in one study, BMD of the hip showed a statistically significant increase compared with placebo in a region composed of predominantly trabecular bone after 1 year of treatment changing to a trend at 2 years that was no longer statistically significant.</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34073-7">
<a name="section-7.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>1. Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Formal studies designed to evaluate drug interactions with calcitonin-salmon have not been done.</p>
<p>Concomitant use of calcitonin and lithium may lead to a reduction in plasma lithium concentrations due to increased urinary clearance of lithium. The dose of lithium may need to be adjusted.</p>
<p>The effects of prior use of diphosphonates in postmenopausal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> patients have not been assessed; however, in patients with Paget's disease prior diphosphonate use appears to reduce the anti-resorptive response to calcitonin-salmon nasal spray.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-7.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>2. Periodic Nasal Examinations</h2>
<p class="First">Periodic nasal examinations with visualization of the nasal mucosa, turbinates, septum and mucosal blood vessel status are recommended.</p>
<p>The development of mucosal alterations or transient nasal conditions have been reported in up to 9% of patients who received a calcitonin-salmon nasal spray and in up to 12% of patients who received placebo nasal spray in studies in postmenopausal women. The majority of patients (approximately 90%) in whom nasal abnormalities were noted also reported nasally related complaints/symptoms as adverse events. Therefore, a nasal examination should be performed prior to start of treatment with nasal calcitonin and at any time nasal complaints occur.</p>
<p>In all postmenopausal patients treated with a calcitonin-salmon nasal spray, the most commonly reported nasal adverse events included <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4320791" conceptname="Rhinitis">rhinitis</span> (12%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318556" conceptname="Epistaxis">epistaxis</span> (3.5%), and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4283893" conceptname="Sinusitis">sinusitis</span> (2.3%). Smoking was shown not to have any contributory effect on the occurrence of nasal adverse events. One patient (0.3%) treated with a calcitonin-salmon nasal spray who was receiving 400 International Units daily developed a small nasal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029919" conceptname="Wound">wound</span>. In clinical trials in another disorder (Paget's disease), 2.8% of patients developed nasal ulcerations.</p>
<p>If severe ulceration of the nasal mucosa occurs, as indicated by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcers</span> greater than 1.5 mm in diameter or penetrating below the mucosa, or those associated with heavy <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, calcitonin-salmon nasal spray should be discontinued. Although smaller <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcers</span> often heal without withdrawal of calcitonin-salmon nasal spray, medication should be discontinued temporarily until healing occurs.</p>

<h2>4. Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">An increased incidence of non-functioning <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437251" conceptname="Benign neoplasm of pituitary gland and craniopharyngeal duct">pituitary adenomas</span> has been observed in 1-year toxicity studies in Sprague-Dawley and Fischer 344 Rats administered (subcutaneously) calcitonin-salmon at dosages of 80 International Units per kilogram per day (16-19 times the recommended human parenteral dose and about 130-160 times the human intranasal dose based on body surface area).</p>
<p>The findings suggest that calcitonin-salmon reduced the latency period for development of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437251" conceptname="Benign neoplasm of pituitary gland and craniopharyngeal duct">pituitary adenomas</span> that do not produce hormones, probably through the perturbation of physiologic processes involved in the evolution of this commonly occurring endocrine lesion in the rat. Although administration of calcitonin-salmon reduces the latency period of the development of nonfunctional proliferative lesions in rats, it did not induce the hyperplastic/neoplastic process.</p>
<p>Calcitonin-salmon was tested for mutagenicity using four <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of <span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span> typhimurium</span> and two <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span>, with and without rat liver metabolic activation, and found to be non-mutagenic.

<p>Common adverse reactions associated with the use of injectable calcitonin-salmon occurred less frequently in patients treated with calcitonin-salmon nasal spray than in those patients treated with injectable calcitonin. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">Nausea</span>, with or without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, which occurred in 1.8% of patients treated with the nasal spray (and 1.5% of those receiving placebo nasal spray) occurs in about 10% of patients who take injectable calcitonin-salmon. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318566" conceptname="Flushing">Flushing</span>, which occurred in less than 1% of patients treated with the nasal spray, occurs in 2-5% of patients treated with injectable calcitonin-salmon. Although the administered dosages of injectable and nasal spray calcitonin-salmon are comparable (50-100 units daily of injectable versus 200 units daily of nasal spray), the nasal dosage form has a mean bioavailability of about 3% (range 0.3%-30.6%) and therefore provides less drug to the systemic circulation, possibly accounting for the decrease in frequency of adverse reactions.</p>
<p>The collective foreign marketing experience with calcitonin-salmon nasal spray does not show evidence of any notable difference in the incidence profile of reported adverse reactions when compared with that seen in the clinical trials.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">No instances of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> with calcitonin-salmon nasal spray have been reported and no serious adverse reactions have been associated with high doses. There is no known potential for drug abuse for calcitonin-salmon.</p>
<p>Single doses of calcitonin-salmon nasal spray up to 1600 International Units, doses up to 800 International Units per day for 3 days and chronic administration of doses up to 600 International Units per day have been studied without serious adverse effects. A 1000 International Units dose of calcitonin-salmon injectable product given subcutaneously may produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>. A 32 International Units per kg per day dose of calcitonin-salmon injectable product for 1or 2 days demonstrated no additional adverse effects.</p>
<p>There have been no reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380534" conceptname="Tetany">hypocalcemic tetany</span>. However, the pharmacologic actions of FORTICAL<span class="Sup">®</span> calcitonin-salmon (rDNA origin) Nasal Spray suggest that this could occur in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. Therefore, provisions for parenteral administration of calcium should be available for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">The recommended dose of FORTICAL<span class="Sup">®</span> calcitonin-salmon (rDNA origin) Nasal Spray in postmenopausal osteoporotic patients is 1 spray (200 International Units) per day administered intranasally, alternating nostrils daily. Each bottle, filled with 3.7 mL of solution, contains enough medication for 30 doses. Drug effect may be monitored by periodic measurements of lumbar vertebral bone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> to document stabilization of bone loss or increases in bone density. Effects of calcitonin-salmon nasal spray on biochemical markers of bone turnover have not been consistently demonstrated in studies in postmenopausal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span>. Therefore, these parameters should not be solely utilized to determine clinical response to calcitonin-salmon nasal spray therapy in these patients.</p>

<p><span class="Bold Italics">Fortical<span class="Sup">®</span> [f?r-t?-kǎl]<br>calcitonin-salmon (rDNA origin)<br>Nasal Spray</span></p>
<p>Read the Patient Information that comes with Fortical<span class="Sup">®</span> Nasal Spray before you start using it and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What is Fortical<span class="Sup">®</span> Nasal Spray?</span></p>
<p>Fortical<span class="Sup">®</span> Nasal Spray is a prescription medicine used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> in women, who went through <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span> (postmenopausal women) at least 5 years ago.</p>
<p>Fortical<span class="Sup">®</span> Nasal Spray contains calcitonin salmon, a man-made protein that is similar to a protein occurring in the human body. When you spray Fortical<span class="Sup">®</span> Nasal Spray into your nostril, it is rapidly absorbed by the blood vessels lining your nasal passages. It then travels into your bloodstream and on to your bones where it has been shown to slow down bone loss at the spine. Slowing down bone loss, while new bone building continues, helps to increase bone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> at the spine.</p>
<p>Fortical<span class="Sup">®</span> Nasal Spray is taken with calcium and vitamin D supplements recommended by your doctor, to help slow down further bone loss. If you are not getting enough calcium and vitamin D in your daily diet, your doctor may recommend a calcium or vitamin D supplement. The amount of calcium and vitamin D needed each day can vary from person to person. Most people generally require at least 1000 mg of calcium and 400 International Units of vitamin D each day. Vitamin D is necessary for your body to use calcium to build bone material. That is why your doctor may have recommended that you add a vitamin D supplement to your diet. It is important to take all the calcium and vitamin D supplements your doctor directs each day.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Who should not use Fortical<span class="Sup">®</span> Nasal Spray?</span></p>
<p>Do not use Fortical<span class="Sup">®</span> Nasal Spray if you are allergic to the calcitonin salmon protein.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What should I tell my doctor before using Fortical<span class="Sup">®</span> Nasal Spray?</span></p>

<li>are breast-feeding. It is not known if Fortical<span class="Sup">®</span> Nasal Spray passes into your breast milk.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Bold">Tell your doctor and pharmacist about all the medicines you take,</span> including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins and herbal supplements.</p>
