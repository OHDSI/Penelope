<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Dihydrocodeine is a semisynthetic narcotic analgesic, related to codeine, with multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of codeine; the most prominent of these involve the central nervous system and organs with smooth-muscle components. The principal action of therapeutic value is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>.</p>
<p>Synalgos-DC also contains the nonnarcotic antipyretic-analgesic, aspirin.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Death</span> Related to Ultra-Rapid Metabolism of Codeine to Morphine</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">Respiratory depression</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> have occurred in children who received codeine in the post-operative period following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy and had evidence of being ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine (i.e., multiple copies of the gene for cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2D6 or high morphine concentrations). <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Deaths</span> have also occurred in nursing infants who were exposed to high levels of morphine in breast milk because their mothers were ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine.</p>
<p>Some individuals may be ultra-rapid metabolizers because of a specific CYP2D6 genotype (gene duplications denoted as *1/*1xN or *1/*2xN). The prevalence of this CYP2D6 phenotype varies widely and has been estimated at 0.5 to 1% in Chinese and Japanese, 0.5 to 1% in Hispanics, 1 to 10% in Caucasians, 3% in African Americans, and 16 to 28% in North Africans, Ethiopians, and Arabs. Data are not available for other ethnic groups. These individuals convert dihydrocodeine into its active metabolite, dihydromorphine, more rapidly and completely than other people. This rapid conversion results in higher than expected serum dihydromorphine levels. Even at labeled dosage regimens, individuals who are ultra-rapid metabolizers may have life-threatening or fatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> or experience signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> (such as extreme <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302536" conceptname="Shallow breathing">shallow breathing</span>). </p>

<p>When prescribing dihydrocodeine-containing drugs, healthcare providers should choose the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time and inform patients and caregivers about these risks and the signs of dihydromorphine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug Dependence</span></h2>
<p class="First">Dihydrocodeine can produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">drug dependence</span> of the codeine type and therefore has the potential of being abused. Psychic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>, physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>, and tolerance may develop upon repeated administration of dihydrocodeine, and it should be prescribed and administered with the same degree of caution appropriate to the use of other oral narcotic-containing medications. Like other narcotic-containing medications, dihydrocodeine is subject to the provisions of the Federal Controlled Substances Act.</p>

<h2>Usage in Ambulatory Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Dihydrocodeine may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. The patient using Synalgos-DC should be cautioned accordingly.</p>
</div>

<h2>Interactions with other Central Nervous System Depressants</h2>
<p class="First">Patients receiving other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with Synalgos-DC may exhibit an additive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span>.

<h2>Usage in Pregnancy</h2>
<p class="First">Reproduction studies have not been performed in animals. There is no adequate information on whether this drug may affect fertility in human males and females or has a teratogenic potential or other adverse effect on the fetus.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34080-2">
<a name="Section_5.7"></a><a name="section-5.6"></a><p></p>
<h2>Usage in Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Dihydrocodeine bitartrate is secreted into human milk. In women with normal dihydrocodeine metabolism (normal CYP2D6 activity), the amount of dihydrocodeine secreted into human milk is low and dosedependent. However, some women are ultra-rapid metabolizers of dihydrocodeine. These women achieve higher-than-expected serum levels of dihydrocodeineâ€™s active metabolite, dihydromorphine, leading to higher-than-expected levels of dihydromorphine in breast milk and potentially dangerously high serum dihydromorphine levels in their breastfed infants. Therefore, maternal use of dihydrocodeine can potentially lead to serious adverse reactions, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>, in nursing infants.</p>
<p>The risk of infant exposure to dihydrocodeine and dihydromorphine through breast milk should be weighed against the benefits of breastfeeding for both the mother and the baby. Caution should be exercised when dihydrocodeine is administered to a nursing woman. If a dihydrocodeine containing product is selected, the lowest dose should be prescribed for the shortest period of time to achieve the desired clinical effect. Mothers using dihydrocodeine should be informed about when to seek immediate medical care and how to identify the signs and symptoms of neonatal toxicity, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> or sedation, difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, and decreased tone, in their baby. Nursing mothers who are ultra-rapid metabolizers may also experience <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> symptoms such as extreme <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302536" conceptname="Shallow breathing">shallow breathing</span>. Prescribers should closely monitor mother-infant pairs and notify treating pediatricians about the use of dihydrocodeine during breast-feeding [see Warnings].</p>
<p>Aspirin and caffeine are also excreted in breast milk in small amounts. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from this combination product, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<h2>Usage in Children</h2>
<p class="First">Preparations containing aspirin should be kept out of the reach of children. Synalgos-DC is not recommended for patients 12 years of age and under. Since there is no experience in chilÂ­dren who have received this drug, safety and efficacy in children have not been established.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">Respiratory depression</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> have occurred in children with obstructive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313459" conceptname="Sleep apnea">sleep apnea</span> who received codeine in the post-operative period following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy and had evidence of being ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine (i.e., multiple copies of the gene for cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2D6 or high morphine concentrations). These children may be particularly sensitive to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine that has been rapidly metabolized to morphine. Synalgos-DC is contraindicated for post-operative <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> management in all pediatric patients undergoing tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy [see Contraindications].</p>

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Advise patients that some people have a genetic variation that results in dihydrocodeine changing into dihydromorphine more rapidly and completely than other people. Most people are unaware of whether they are an ultra-rapid dihydrocodeine metabolizer or not. These higher-than-normal levels of dihydromorphine in the blood may lead to life-threatening or fatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> or signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> such as extreme <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302536" conceptname="Shallow breathing">shallow breathing</span>. Children with this genetic variation who were prescribed codeine after tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy for obstructive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313459" conceptname="Sleep apnea">sleep apnea</span> may be at greatest risk based on reports of several <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> in this population due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>. Synalgos- DC is contraindicated in all children who undergo tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. Advise caregivers of children receiving Synalgos-DC for other reasons to monitor for signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>.</p>
<p>Advise patients that nursing mothers taking dihydrocodeine can have higher dihydromorphine levels in their breast milk if they are ultra-rapid metabolizers. These higher levels of dihydromorphine in breast milk may lead to life-threatening or fatal side effects in nursing babies. Advise nursing mothers to watch for signs of dihydromorphine toxicity in their infants which includes increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, or limpness. Instruct nursing mothers to talk to the babyâ€™s doctor immediately if they notice these signs and, if they cannot reach the doctor right away, to take the baby to an emergency room or call 911 (or local emergency services).</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of Synalgos-DC did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects.</p>
<p>In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>
