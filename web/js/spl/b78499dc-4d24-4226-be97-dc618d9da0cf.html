<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<a href="http://"></a>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY<p class="First">Metoclopramide stimulates motility of the upper gastrointestinal 
tract without stimulating gastric, biliary, or pancreatic secretions. Its mode 
of action is unclear. It seems to sensitize tissues to the action of 
acetylcholine. The effect of metoclopramide on motility is not dependent on 
intact vagal innervation, but it can be abolished by anticholinergic drugs.</p>
<p>Metoclopramide increases the tone and amplitude of gastric (especially 
antral) contractions, relaxes the pyloric sphincter and the duodenal bulb, and 
increases peristalsis of the duodenum and jejunum resulting in accelerated 
gastric emptying and intestinal transit. It increases the resting tone of the 
lower esophageal sphincter. It has little, if any, effect on the motility of the 
colon or gallbladder.</p>
<p>In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318800" conceptname="Gastroesophageal reflux disease">gastroesophageal reflux</span> and low LESP (lower esophageal 
sphincter pressure), single oral doses of metoclopramide produce dose-related 
increases in LESP. Effects begin at about 5 mg and increase through 20 mg (the 
largest dose tested). The increase in LESP from a 5 mg dose lasts about 45 
minutes and that of 20 mg lasts between 2 and 3 hours. Increased rate of stomach 
emptying has been observed with single oral doses of 10 mg.</p>
<p>The antiemetic properties of metoclopramide appear to be a result of its 
antagonism of central and peripheral dopamine receptors. Dopamine produces 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> by stimulation of the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone 
(CTZ), and metoclopramide blocks stimulation of the CTZ by agents like l-dopa or 
apomorphine which are known to increase dopamine levels or to possess 
dopamine-like effects. Metoclopramide also abolishes the slowing of gastric 
emptying caused by apomorphine.</p>
<p>Like the phenothiazines and related drugs, which are also dopamine 
antagonists, metoclopramide produces sedation and may produce extrapyramidal 
reactions, although these are comparatively rare (see <span>WARNINGS</span>). Metoclopramide inhibits the central and 
peripheral effects of apomorphine, induces release of prolactin and causes a 
transient increase in circulating aldosterone levels, which may be associated 
with transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4125002" conceptname="Idiopathic fluid retention">fluid retention</span>.</p>
<p>The onset of pharmacological action of metoclopramide is 1 to 3 minutes 
following an intravenous dose, 10 to 15 minutes following intramuscular 
administration, and 30 to 60 minutes following an oral dose, pharmacological 
effects persist for 1 to 2 hours.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics: </span>Metoclopramide is rapidly and well 
absorbed. Relative to an intravenous dose of 20 mg, the absolute oral 
bioavailability of metoclopramide is 80%±15.5% as demonstrated in a crossover 
study of 18 subjects. Peak plasma concentrations occur at about 1-2 hrs after a 
single oral dose. Similar time to peak is observed after individual doses at 
steady state.</p>
<p>In a single dose study of 12 subjects, the area under the drug 
concentration-time curve increases linearly with doses from 20 to 100 mg. Peak 
concentrations increase linearly with dose; time to peak concentrations remains 
the same; whole body clearance is unchanged; and the elimination rate remains 
the same. The average elimination half-life in individuals with normal renal 
function is 5-6 hrs. Linear kinetic processes adequately describe the absorption 
and elimination of metoclopramide.</p>
<p>Approximately 85% of the radioactivity of an orally administered dose appears 
in the urine within 72 hrs. Of the 85% eliminated in the urine, about half is 
present as free or conjugated metoclopramide.</p>
<p>The drug is not extensively bound to plasma proteins (about 30%). The whole 
body volume of distribution is high (about 3.5 L/kg) which suggests extensive 
distribution of drug to the tissues.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal impairment</span> affects the clearance of metoclopramide. In a study with 
patients with varying degrees of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, a reduction in creatinine 
clearance was correlated with a reduction in plasma clearance, renal clearance, 
non-renal clearance, and increase in elimination half-life. The kinetics of 
metoclopramide in the presence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> remained linear however. The 
reduction in clearance as a result of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> suggests that adjustment 
downward of maintenance dosage should be done to avoid drug accumulation.</p>

<p>In pediatric patients, the pharmacodynamics of metoclopramide following oral 
and intravenous administration are highly variable and a concentration-effect 
relationship has not been established.</p>
<p>There are insufficient reliable data to conclude whether the pharmacokinetics 
of metoclopramide in adults and the pediatric population are similar. Although 
there are insufficient data to support the efficacy of metoclopramide in 
pediatric patients with symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318800" conceptname="Gastroesophageal reflux disease">gastroesophageal reflux</span> (GER) or cancer 
chemotherapy-related <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, its pharmacokinetics have been studied 
in these patient populations.</p>
<p>In an open-label study, six pediatric patients (age range, 3.5 weeks to 5.4 
months) with GER received metoclopramide 0.15 mg/kg oral solution every 6 hours 
for 10 doses. The mean peak plasma concentration of metoclopramide after the 
tenth dose was 2-fold (56.8 mcg/L) higher compared to that observed after the 
first dose (29 mcg/L) indicating drug accumulation with repeated dosing. After 
the tenth dose, the mean time to reach peak concentrations (2.2 hrs), half-life 
(4.1 hrs), clearance (0.67 L/h/kg), and volume of distribution (4.4 L/kg) of 
metoclopramide were similar to those observed after the first dose. In the 
youngest patient (age, 3.5 weeks), metoclopramide half-life after the first and 
the tenth dose (23.1 and 10.3 hrs, respectively) was significantly longer 
compared to other infants due to reduced clearance. This may be attributed to 
immature hepatic and renal systems at birth.</p>
<p>Single intravenous doses of metoclopramide 0.22 to 0.46 mg/kg (mean, 0.35 
mg/kg) were administered over 5 minutes to nine pediatric cancer patients 
receiving chemotherapy (mean age, 11.7 years; range, 7 to 14 yrs) for 
prophylaxis of cytotoxic-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>. The metoclopramide plasma 
concentrations extrapolated to time zero ranged from 65 to 395 mcg/L (mean, 152 
mcg/L). The mean elimination half-life, clearance, and volume of distribution of 
metoclopramide were 4.4 hrs (range, 1.7 to 8.3 hrs), 0.56 L/h/kg (range, 0.12 to 
1.20 L/h/kg), and 3.0 L/kg (range, 1.0 to 4.8 L/kg), respectively.</p>
<p>In another study, nine pediatric cancer patients (age range, 1 to 9 yrs) 
received 4 to 5 intravenous infusions (over 30 minutes) of metoclopramide at a 
dose of 2 mg/kg to control <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span>. After the last dose, the peak serum 
concentrations of metoclopramide ranged from 1060 to 5680 mcg/L. The mean 
elimination half-life, clearance, and volume of distribution of metoclopramide 
were 4.5 hrs (range, 2.0 to 12.5 hrs), 0.37 L/h/kg (range, 0.10 to 1.24 L/h/kg), 
and 1.93 L/kg (range, 0.95 to 5.50 L/kg), respectively.</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<a href="http://"></a>General. <p class="First">In one study in hypertensive patients, intravenously administered 
metoclopramide was shown to release catecholamines, hence, caution should be 
exercised when metoclopramide is used in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>.</p>
<p>Intravenous injections of undiluted metoclopramide should be made slowly 
allowing 1 to 2 minutes for 10 mg since a transient but intense feeling of 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">restlessness</span>, followed by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, may occur with rapid 
administration.</p>
<p>Because metoclopramide produces a transient increase in plasma aldosterone, 
certain patients, especially those with cirrhosis or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>, 
may be at risk of developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4125002" conceptname="Idiopathic fluid retention">fluid retention</span> and volume overload. If these side 
effects occur at any time during metoclopramide therapy,the drug should be 
discontinued.</p>
<p>Intravenous administration of Metoclopramide Injection, USP, diluted in a 
parenteral solution should be made slowly over a period of not less than 15 
minutes.</p>
<p>Giving a promotility drug such as metoclopramide theoretically could put 
increased pressure on suture lines following a gut anastomosis or closure. This 
possibility should be considered and weighed when deciding whether to use 
metoclopramide or nasogastric suction in the prevention of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4274029" conceptname="Postoperative nausea">postoperative nausea</span> 
and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Information for Patients.<p>Metoclopramide may impair the mental and/or physical abilities 
required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as operating machinery or 
driving a motor vehicle. The ambulatory patient should be cautioned 
accordingly.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Drug Interactions.<p>The effects of metoclopramide on gastrointestinal motility are 
antagonized by anticholinergic drugs and narcotic analgesics. Additive sedative 
effects can occur when metoclopramide is given with alcohol, sedatives, 
hypnotics, narcotics or tranquilizers.</p>
<p>The finding that metoclopramide releases catecholamines in patients with 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320128" conceptname="Essential hypertension">essential hypertension</span> suggests that it should be used cautiously, if at all, in 
patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors.</p>
<p>Absorption of drugs from the stomach may be diminished (e.g., digoxin) by 
metoclopramide, whereas the rate and/or extent of absorption of drugs from the 
small bowel may be increased (e.g., acetaminophen, tetracycline, levodopa, 
ethanol, cyclosporine).</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="195847" conceptname="Gastroparesis syndrome">Gastroparesis</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="195847" conceptname="Gastroparesis syndrome">gastric stasis</span>) may be responsible for poor diabetic control 
in some patients. Exogenously administered insulin may begin to act before food 
has left the stomach and lead to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. Because the action of 
metoclopramide will influence the delivery of food to the intestines and thus 
the rate of absorption, insulin dosage or timing of dosage may require 
adjustment.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: 
<p>A 77-week study was conducted in rats with oral doses up to about 
40 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Metoclopramide elevates 
prolactin levels and the elevation persists during chronic administration. 
Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast 
cancers are prolactin-dependent <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>, a factor of 
potential importance if the prescription of metoclopramide is contemplated in a 
patient with previously detected breast cancer. Although disturbances such as 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79884" conceptname="Galactorrhea not associated with childbirth">galactorrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443800" conceptname="Amenorrhea">amenorrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168447" conceptname="Gynecomastia">gynecomastia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">impotence</span> have been reported with 
prolactin-elevating drugs, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin 
levels is unknown for most patients. An increase in mammary neoplasms has been 
found in rodents after chronic administration of prolactin-stimulating 
neuroleptic drugs and metoclopramide. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic 
studies conducted to date, however, have shown an association between chronic 
administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis; the available evidence 
is too limited to be conclusive at this time.</p>
<p>An Ames mutagenicity test performed on metoclopramide was negative.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pregnancy, Teratogenic Effects, Pregnancy Category 
B:<p>Reproduction studies performed in rats, mice, and rabbits by the 
IV, IM, subcutaneous (SC), and oral routes at maximum levels ranging from 12 to 
250 times the human dose have demonstrated no impairment of fertility or 
significant harm to the fetus due to metoclopramide. There are, however, no 
adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal 
reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug 
should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Nursing Mothers: <p>Metoclopramide is excreted in human milk. Caution should be 
exercised when metoclopramide is administered to a nursing mother.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pediatric Use:<p>Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been 
established except as stated to facilitate small bowel intubation (see <span>OVERDOSAGE </span>and <span>DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION </span>).</p>
<p>Care should be exercised in administering metoclopramide to neonates since 
prolonged clearance may produce excessive serum concentrations (see <span>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY </span><span class="Bold">− 
Pharmacokinetics</span>).</p>
<p>In addition, neonates have reduced levels of NADH-cytochrome b<span class="Sub">5</span> reductase which, in combination with the aforementioned 
pharmacokinetic factors, make neonates more susceptible to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">methemoglobinemia</span> 
(see <span>OVERDOSAGE</span>).</p>
<p>The safety profile of metoclopramide in adults cannot be extrapolated to 
pediatric patients. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375800" conceptname="Dystonia">Dystonias</span> and other extrapyramidal reactions associated with 
metoclopramide are more common in the pediatric population than in adults. (See 
<span>WARNINGS </span>and <span>ADVERSE REACTIONS</span><span class="Bold">−Extrapyramidal 
Reactions.</span>)</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Geriatric Use:<p>Clinical studies of metoclopramide did not include sufficient 
numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects 
respond differently from younger subjects.</p>
<p>The risk of developing parkinsonian-like side effects increases with 
ascending dose. Geriatric patients should receive the lowest dose of 
metoclopramide that is effective. If parkinsonian-like symptoms develop in a 
geriatric patient receiving metoclopramide, metoclopramide should generally be 
discontinued before initiating any specific anti-parkinsonian agents (see <span>WARNINGS</span>).</p>
<p>The elderly may be at greater risk for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> (see <span>WARNINGS</span><span class="Bold">−Tardive 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047115" conceptname="Oral dyskinesia">Dyskinesia</span></span>).</p>
<p>Sedation has been reported in metoclopramide users. Sedation may cause 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> and manifest as over-sedation in elderly (see <span>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, PRECAUTIONS</span><span class="Bold">−Information for Patients </span>and <span>ADVERSE REACTIONS</span><span class="Bold">−CNS 
Effects</span>).</p>
<p>Metoclopramide is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the 
risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired 
renal function (see <span>DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION</span><span class="Bold">−Use in Patients with Renal or Hepatic 
Impairment</span>).</p>
<p>For these reasons, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, 
usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater 
frequency of decreased renal function, concomitant disease, or other drug 
therapy in the elderly (see <span>USE IN PATIENTS WITH 
RENAL OR <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">HEPATIC IMPAIRMENT</span></span>).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Other Special Populations: </span>Patients with 
NADH-cytochrome b<span class="Sub">5 </span>reductase deficiency are at an 
increased risk of developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">methemoglobinemia</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137763" conceptname="Sulfhemoglobinemia">sulfhemoglobinemia</span> when

<p>The preferred parenteral solution is Sodium Chloride Injection (normal 
saline), which when combined with Metoclopramide Injection, USP, can be stored 
frozen for up to 4 weeks. Metoclopramide Injection, USP is degraded when admixed 
and frozen with Dextrose-5% in Water. Metoclopramide Injection, USP diluted in 
Sodium Chloride Injection, Dextrose-5% in Water, Dextrose-5% in 0.45% Sodium 
Chloride, Ringer's Injection, or Lactated Ringer's Injection may be stored up to 
48 hours (without freezing) after preparation if protected from light. All 
dilutions may be stored unprotected from light under normal light conditions up

<p>The recommended single dose is: Pediatric patients above 14 years of age and 
adults − 10 mg metoclopramide base. Pediatric patients (6 − 14 years of age) − 
2.5 to 5 mg metoclopramide base; (under 6 years of age) − 0.1 mg/kg

initiated at approximately one-half the recommended dosage. Depending upon 
clinical efficacy and safety considerations, the dosage may be increased or 
decreased as appropriate.</p>
<p>See <span>OVERDOSAGE </span>section for information 
regarding dialysis.</p>
<p>Metoclopramide undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism, except for simple 
conjugation. Its safe use has been described in patients with advanced liver 
disease whose renal function was normal.</p>
