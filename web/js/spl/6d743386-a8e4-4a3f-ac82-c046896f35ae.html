<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Triazolam tablets contain triazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine hypnotic agent.</p>
<p>Triazolam is a white crystalline powder, soluble in alcohol and poorly soluble in water. It has a molecular weight of 343.21.</p>
<p>The chemical name for triazolam is 8-chloro-6-(<span class="Italics">o</span>-chlorophenyl)-1-methyl-4<span class="Italics">H</span>-<span class="Italics">s</span>-triazolo-[4,3-Î±] [1,4]benzodiazepine.</p>
<p>The structural formula is represented below:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="Image from Drug Label Content" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=6D743386-A8E4-4A3F-AC82-C046896F35AE&amp;name=triazolam-tablets-02.jpg"></div>
<p>Each triazolam tablet, for oral administration, contains 0.125 mg or 0.25 mg of triazolam. Inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, D&amp;C Yellow No. 10 (0.25 mg only), lactose, magnesium stearate, maize (corn) starch, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, sodium benzoate, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium starch glycollate.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Triazolam is a hypnotic with a short mean plasma half-life reported to be in the range of 1.5 to 5.5 hours. In normal subjects treated for 7 days with four times the recommended dosage, there was no evidence of altered systemic bioavailability, rate of elimination, or accumulation. Peak plasma levels are reached within 2 hours following oral administration. Following recommended doses of triazolam, triazolam peak plasma levels in the range of 1 to 6 ng/mL are seen. The plasma levels achieved are proportional to the dose given.</p>
<p>Triazolam and its metabolites, principally as conjugated glucuronides, which are presumably inactive, are excreted primarily in the urine. Only small amounts of unmetabolized triazolam appear in the urine. The two primary metabolites accounted for 79.9% of urinary excretion. Urinary excretion appeared to be biphasic in its time course.</p>
<p>Triazolam tablets 0.5 mg, in two separate studies, did not affect the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> times or plasma warfarin levels in male volunteers administered sodium warfarin orally.</p>
<p>Extremely high concentrations of triazolam do not displace bilirubin bound to human serum albumin <span class="Italics">in vitro.</span></p>
<p>Triazolam <span class="Sup">14</span>C was administered orally to pregnant mice. Drug-related material appeared uniformly distributed in the fetus with <span class="Sup">14</span>C concentrations approximately the same as in the brain of the mother.</p>
<p>In sleep laboratory studies, triazolam tablets significantly decreased sleep latency, increased the duration of sleep, and decreased the number of nocturnal awakenings. After 2 weeks of consecutive nightly administration, the drugâ€™s effect on total wake time is decreased, and the values recorded in the last third of the night approach baseline levels. On the first and/or second night after drug discontinuance (first or second post-drug night), total time asleep, percentage of time spent sleeping, and rapidity of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falling</span> asleep frequently were significantly less than on baseline (predrug) nights. This effect is often called â€œreboundâ€? <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>.</p>
<p>The type and duration of hypnotic effects and the profile of unwanted effects during administration of benzodiazepine drugs may be influenced by the biologic half-life of administered drug and any active metabolites formed. When half-lives are long, the drug or metabolites may accumulate during periods of nightly administration and be associated with impairments of cognitive and motor performance during waking hours; the possibility of interaction with other psychoactive drugs or alcohol will be enhanced. In contrast, if half-lives are short, the drug and metabolites will be cleared before the next dose is ingested, and carry-over effects related to excessive sedation or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span> should be minimal or absent. However, during nightly use for an extended period, pharmacodynamic tolerance or adaptation to some effects of benzodiazepine hypnotics may develop. If the drug has a short half-life of elimination, it is possible that a relative deficiency of the drug or its active metabolites (i.e., in relationship to the receptor site) may occur at some point in the interval between each nightâ€™s use. This sequence of events may account for two clinical findings reported to occur after several weeks of nightly use of rapidly eliminated benzodiazepine hypnotics: 1) increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4100068" conceptname="Wakefulness">wakefulness</span> during the last third of the night, and 2) the appearance of increased daytime <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> after 10 days of continuous treatment.</p>
<p>In a study of elderly (62 to 83 years old) versus younger subjects (21 to 41 years old) who received triazolam at the same dose levels (0.125 mg and 0.25 mg), the elderly experienced both greater sedation and impairment of psychomotor performance. These effects resulted largely from higher plasma concentrations of triazolam in the elderly.</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Triazolam is indicated for the short-term treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> (generally 7 to 10 days). Use for more than 2 to 3 weeks requires complete reevaluation of the patient (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p>
<p>Prescriptions for triazolam should be written for short-term use (7 to 10 days) and it should not be prescribed in quantities exceeding a 1-month supply.</p>

<a name="i4i_contraindications_ID_E0028F62-C6E4-4393-A716-DD4CDE8CDBDF"></a><a name="section-5"></a><p></p>
<h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Triazolam tablets are contraindicated in patients with known <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> to this drug or other benzodiazepines.</p>
<p>Benzodiazepines may cause fetal damage when administered during pregnancy. An increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of diazepam and chlordiazepoxide during the first trimester of pregnancy has been suggested in several studies. Transplacental distribution has resulted in neonatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span> following the ingestion of therapeutic doses of a benzodiazepine hypnotic during the last weeks of pregnancy.</p>
<p>Triazolam is contraindicated in pregnant women. If there is a likelihood of the patient becoming pregnant while receiving triazolam, she should be warned of the potential risk to the fetus. Patients should be instructed to discontinue the drug prior to becoming pregnant. The possibility that a woman of childbearing potential may be pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered.</p>
<p>Triazolam is contraindicated with ketoconazole, itraconazole, and nefazodone, medications that significantly impair the oxidative metabolism mediated by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP 3A) (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS </span>and <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions</span>).</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435524" conceptname="Sleep disorder">Sleep disturbances</span> may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and/or psychiatric disorder, symptomatic treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> should be initiated only after a careful evaluation of the patient. <span class="Bold">The failure of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated. </span>Worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> or the emergence of new thinking or behavior abnormalities may be the consequence of an unrecognized psychiatric or physical disorder. Such findings have emerged during the course of treatment with sedative-hypnotic drugs. Because some of the important adverse effects of sedative-hypnotics appear to be dose related (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS </span>and <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>), it is important to use the smallest possible effective dose, especially in the elderly.</p>
<p>Complex behaviors such as â€œsleep-drivingâ€? (i.e., driving while not fully awake after ingestion of a sedative-hypnotic, with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439147" conceptname="Amnesia">amnesia</span> for the event) have been reported. These events can occur in sedative-hypnotic-naÃ¯ve as well as in sedative-hypnotic-experienced persons. Although behaviors such as sleep-driving may occur with sedative-hypnotics alone at therapeutic doses, the use of alcohol and other CNS depressants with sedative-hypnotics appears to increase the risk of such behaviors, as does the use of sedative-hypnotics at doses exceeding the maximum recommended dose. Due to the risk to the patient and the community, discontinuation of sedative-hypnotics should be strongly considered for patients who report a â€œsleep-drivingâ€? episode.</p>
<p>Other complex behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have been reported in patients who are not fully awake after taking a sedative-hypnotic. As with sleep-driving, patients usually do not remember these events.</p>

<h2>Severe anaphylatic and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4148381" conceptname="Anaphylactoid reaction">anaphylactoid reactions</span></h2>
<p class="First">Rare cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432791" conceptname="Angioedema">angioedema</span> involving the tongue, glottis or larynx have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of sedative-hypnotics, including triazolam. Some patients have had additional symptoms such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">dyspnea</span>, throat closing, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> that suggest <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylaxis</span>. Some patients have required medical therapy in the emergency department. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432791" conceptname="Angioedema">angioedema</span> involves the tongue, glottis or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Patients who develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432791" conceptname="Angioedema">angioedema</span> after treatment with triazolam should not be rechallenged with the drug.</p>

<h2>Central nervous system manifestations</h2>
<p class="First">An increase in daytime <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> has been reported for triazolam after as few as 10 days of continuous use. In some patients this may be a manifestation of interdose withdrawal (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>). If increased daytime <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> is observed during treatment, discontinuation of treatment may be advisable.</p>
<p>A variety of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4131797" conceptname="Disturbance in thinking">abnormal thinking</span> and behavior changes have been reported to occur in association with the use of benzodiazepine hypnotics including triazolam. Some of these changes may be characterized by decreased inhibition, e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021344" conceptname="Abusive behavior">aggressiveness</span> and extroversion that seem excessive, similar to that seen with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., sedative/hypnotics). Other kinds of behavioral changes have also been reported, for example, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4092397" conceptname="Bizarre behavior">bizarre behavior</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4085688" conceptname="Loss of identity">depersonalization</span>. In primarily depressed patients, the worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, including suicidal thinking, has been reported in association with the use of benzodiazepines.</p>
<p>It can rarely be determined with certainty whether a particular instance of the abnormal behaviors listed above is drug induced, spontaneous in origin, or a result of an underlying psychiatric or physical disorder. Nonetheless, the emergence of any new behavioral sign or symptom of concern requires careful and immediate evaluation.</p>
<p>Because of its depressant CNS effects, patients receiving triazolam should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. For the same reason, patients should be cautioned about the concomitant ingestion of alcohol and other CNS depressant drugs during treatment with triazolam tablets.</p>
<p>As with some, but not all benzodiazepines, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4229448" conceptname="Anterograde amnesia">anterograde amnesia</span> of varying severity and paradoxical reactions have been reported following therapeutic doses of triazolam. Data from several sources suggest that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4229448" conceptname="Anterograde amnesia">anterograde amnesia</span> may occur at a higher rate with triazolam than with other benzodiazepine hypnotics.</p>

<h2>Triazolam interaction with drugs that inhibit metabolism via cytochrome P450 3A</h2>
<p class="First">The initial step in triazolam metabolism is hydroxylation catalyzed by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP 3A). Drugs that inhibit this metabolic pathway may have a profound effect on the clearance of triazolam. Consequently, triazolam should be avoided in patients receiving very potent inhibitors of CYP 3A. With drugs inhibiting CYP 3A to a lesser but still significant degree, triazolam should be used only with caution and consideration of appropriate dosage reduction. For some drugs, an interaction with triazolam has been quantified with clinical data; for other drugs, interactions are predicted from <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>data and/or experience with similar drugs in the same pharmacologic class.</p>
<p>The following are examples of drugs known to inhibit the metabolism of triazolam and/or related benzodiazepines, presumably through inhibition of CYP 3A.</p>

<h2>Potent CYP 3A Inhibitors</h2>
<p class="First">Potent inhibitors of CYP 3A that should not be used concomitantly with triazolam include ketoconazole, itraconazole, and nefazodone. Although data concerning the effects of azole-type antifungal agents other than ketoconazole and itraconazole on triazolam metabolism are not available, they should be considered potent CYP 3A inhibitors, and their coadministration with triazolam is not recommended (see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>).</p>

<h2>Drugs demonstrated to be CYP 3A inhibitors on the basis of clinical studies involving triazolam (caution and consideration of dose reduction are recommended during coadministration with triazolam)</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Macrolide Antibiotics </span>- Coadministration of erythromycin increased the maximum plasma concentration of triazolam by 46%, decreased clearance by 53%, and increased half-life by 35%; caution and consideraton of appropriate triazolam dose reduction are recommended. Similar caution should be observed during coadministration with clarithromycin and other macrolide antibiotics.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Cimetidine </span>- Coadministration of cimetidine increased the maximum plasma concentration of triazolam by 51%, decreased clearance by 55%, and increased half-life by 68%, caution and consideration of appropriate triazolam dose reduction are recommended.</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">In elderly and/or debilitated patients, it is recommended that treatment with triazolam tablets be initiated at 0.125 mg to decrease the possibility of development of oversedation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, or impaired coordination.</p>
<p>Some side effects reported in association with the use of triazolam appear to be dose related. These include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, light-headedness, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439147" conceptname="Amnesia">amnesia</span>.</p>
<p>The relationship between dose and what may be more serious behavioral phenomena is less certain. Specifically, some evidence, based on spontaneous marketing reports, suggests that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, bizarre or abnormal behavior, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span> may also be dose related, but this evidence is inconclusive. In accordance with good medical practice it is recommended that therapy be initiated at the lowest effective dose (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p>
<p>Cases of â€œtravelerâ€™s amnesiaâ€? have been reported by individuals who have taken triazolam to induce sleep while traveling, such as during an airplane flight. In some of these cases, insufficient time was allowed for the sleep period prior to awakening and before beginning activity. Also, the concomitant use of alcohol may have been a factor in some cases.</p>
<p>Caution should be exercised if triazolam is prescribed to patients with signs or symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> that could be intensified by hypnotic drugs. Suicidal tendencies may be present in such patients and protective measures may be required. Intentional over-dosage is more common in these patients, and the least amount of drug that is feasible should be available to the patient at any one time.</p>
<p>The usual precautions should be observed in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, chronic pulmonary insufficiency, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313459" conceptname="Sleep apnea">sleep apnea</span>. In patients with compromised respiratory function, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span> have been reported infrequently.</p>

<h2>"Sleep-driving" and other complex behaviours</h2>
<p class="First">There have been reports of people getting out of bed after taking a sedative-hypnotic and driving their cars while not fully awake, often with no memory of the event. If a patient experiences such an episode, it should be reported to his or her doctor immediately, since â€œsleep-drivingâ€? can be dangerous. This behavior is more likely to occur when sedative-hypnotics are taken with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>). Other complex behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have been reported in patients who are not fully awake after taking a sedative hypnotic. As with sleep-driving, patients usually do not remember these events.</p>

<h2>Drugs demonstrated to be CYP 3A inhibitors on the basis of clinical studies involving benzodiazepines metabolized similarly to triazolam or on the basis of in vitro studies with triazolam or other benzodiazepines (caution is recommended during coadministration with triazolam):</h2>
<p class="First">Available data from clinical studies of benzodiazepines other than triazolam suggest a possible drug interaction with triazolam for the following: fluvoxamine, diltiazem, and verapamil. Data from <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>studies of triazolam suggest a possible drug interaction with triazolam for the following: sertraline and paroxetine. Data from <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>studies of benzodiazepines other than triazolam suggest a possible drug interaction with triazolam for the following: ergotamine, cyclosporine, amiodarone, nicardipine, and nifedipine. Caution is recommended during coadministration of any of these drugs with triazolam (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p>

<h2>Drugs that affect triazolam pharmacokinetics by other mechanisms:</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Ranitidine </span>- Coadministration of ranitidine increased the maximum plasma concentration of triazolam by 30%, increased the area under the concentration curve by 27%, and increased half-life by 3.3%.

<h2>Pregnancy:</h2>
<p class="First">1. Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy category X (see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>).</p>
<p>2. Non-teratogenic effects: It is to be considered that the child born of a mother who is on benzodiazepines may be at some risk for withdrawal symptoms from the drug, during the postnatal period. Also, neonatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">flaccidity</span> has been reported in an infant born of a mother who had been receiving benzodiazepines.</p>

<h2>Nursing mothers:</h2>
<p class="First">Human studies have not been performed; however, studies in rats have indicated that triazolam and its metabolites are secreted in milk. Therefore, administration of triazolam to nursing mothers is not recommended.</p>

<h2>Geriatric use:</h2>
<p class="First">The elderly are especially susceptible to the dose related adverse effects of triazolam. They exhibit higher plasma triazolam concentrations due to reduced clearance of the drug as compared with younger subjects at the same dose. To minimize the possibility of development of oversedation, the smallest effective dose should be used (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS </span>and <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>.)</p>

<h2>Tolerance/Withdrawal Phenomena</h2>
<p class="First">Some loss of effectiveness or adaptation to the sleep inducing effects of these medications may develop after nightly use for more than a few weeks and there may be a degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> that develops. For the benzodiazepine sleeping pills that are eliminated quickly from the body, a relative deficiency of the drug may occur at some point in the interval between each nightâ€™s use. This can lead to (1) increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4100068" conceptname="Wakefulness">wakefulness</span> during the last third of the night, and (2) the appearance of increased signs of daytime <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436817" conceptname="Feeling nervous">nervousness</span>.These two events have been reported in particular for triazolam.</p>
<p>There can be more severe â€˜withdrawalâ€™ effects when a benzodiazepine sleeping pill is stopped. Such effects can occur after discontinuing these drugs following use for only a week or two, but may be more common and more severe after longer periods of continuous use. One type of withdrawal phenomenon is the occurrence of what is known as â€˜rebound insomniaâ€™. That is, on the first few nights after the drug is stopped, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> is actually worse than before the sleeping pill was given. Other withdrawal phenomena following abrupt stopping of benzodiazepine sleeping pills range from mild unpleasant feelings to a major withdrawal syndrome which may include abdominal and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75635" conceptname="Cramp">muscle cramps</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span>, and rarely, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">During placebo-controlled clinical studies in which 1,003 patients received triazolam tablets, the most troublesome side effects were extensions of the pharmacologic activity of triazolam, e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, or light-headedness.</p>
<p>The figures cited below are estimates of untoward clinical event incidence among subjects who participated in the relatively short duration (i.e., 1 to 42 days) placebo-controlled clinical trials of triazolam. The figures cannot be used to predict precisely the incidence of untoward events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors often differ from those in clinical trials. These figures cannot be compared with those obtained from other clinical studies involving related drug products and placebo, as each group of drug trials is conducted under a different set of conditions.</p>
<p>Comparison of the cited figures, however, can provide the prescriber with some basis for estimating the relative contributions of drug and nondrug factors to the untoward event incidence rate in the population studied. Even this use must be approached cautiously, as a drug may relieve a symptom in one patient while inducing it in others. (For example, an anticholinergic, anxiolytic drug may relieve <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226991" conceptname="Aptyalism">dry mouth</span> [a sign of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>] in some subjects but induce it [an untoward event] in others).</p>

Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> is a state of adaptation that is manifested by a specific withdrawal syndrome that can be produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, decreasing blood level of the drug and/or administration of an antagonist. Tolerance is a state of adaptation in which exposure to a drug induces changes that result in a diminution of one or more of the drugâ€™s effects over time. Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs and may develop at different rates for different effects.</p>
<p>Addiction is a primary, chronic, neurobiological disease with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations. It is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following: impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug addiction</span> is a treatable disease, utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common.</p>

<h2>Abuse, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">Dependence</span> and Withdrawal:</h2>
<p class="First">Withdrawal symptoms, similar in character to those noted with barbiturates and alcohol (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span>, abdominal and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75635" conceptname="Cramp">muscle cramps</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4148767" conceptname="Dysphoric mood">dysphoria</span>, perceptual disturbances and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>), have occurred following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines, including triazolam. The more severe symptoms are usually associated with higher dosages and longer usage, although patients at therapeutic dosages given for as few as 1 to 2 weeks can also have withdrawal symptoms and in some patients there may be withdrawal symptoms (daytime <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>) between nightly doses (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>). Consequently, abrupt discontinuation should be avoided and a gradual dosage tapering schedule is recommended in any patient taking more than the lowest dose for more than a few weeks. The recommendation for tapering is particularly important in any patient with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span>.</p>
<p>The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> is increased in patients with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218106" conceptname="Alcoholism">alcoholism</span>, drug abuse, or in patients with marked <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441838" conceptname="Personality disorder">personality disorders</span>. Such <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>-prone individuals should be under careful surveillance when receiving triazolam.

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Because of the potency of triazolam, some manifestations of overdosage may occur at 2 mg, four times the maximum recommended therapeutic dose (0.5 mg).</p>
<p>Manifestations of overdosage with triazolam tablets include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, impaired coordination, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196636" conceptname="Dysarthria">slurred speech</span>, and ultimately, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">Respiratory depression</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span> have been reported with overdosages of triazolam. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">Seizures</span> have occasionally been reported after overdosages.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Death</span> has been reported in association with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> of triazolam by itself, as it has with other benzodiazepines. In addition, fatalities have been reported in patients who have overdosed with a combination of a single benzodiazepine, including triazolam, and alcohol; benzodiazepine and alcohol levels seen in some of these cases have been lower than those usually associated with reports of fatality with either substance alone.</p>
<p>As in all cases of drug overdosage, respiration, pulse, and blood pressure should be monitored and supported by general measures when necessary. Immediate gastric lavage should be performed. An adequate airway should be maintained. Intravenous fluids may be administered.</p>
<p>Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, is indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines and may be used in situations when an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> with a benzodiazepine is known or suspected. Prior to the administration of flumazenil, necessary measures should be instituted to secure airway, ventilation and intravenous access. Flumazenil is intended as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, proper management of benzodiazepine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. Patients treated with flumazenil should be monitored for re-sedation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, and other residual benzodiazepine effects for an appropriate period after treatment. <span class="Bold">The prescriber should be aware of a risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> in association with flumazenil treatment, particularly in long-term benzodiazepine users and in cyclic antidepressant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. </span>The complete flumazenil package insert including <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>, <span class="Bold">WARNINGS </span>and <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS </span>should be consulted prior to use.</p>
<p>Experiments in animals have indicated that cardiopulmonary collapse can occur with massive intravenous doses of triazolam. This could be reversed with positive mechanical respiration and the intravenous infusion of norepinephrine bitartrate or metaraminol bitartrate. Hemodialysis and forced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span> are probably of little value. As with the management of intentional overdosage with any drug, the physician should bear in mind that multiple agents may have been ingested by the patient.</p>
<p>The oral LD50 in mice is greater than 1,000 mg/kg and in rats is greater than 5,000 mg/kg.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">It is important to individualize the dosage of triazolam tablets for maximum beneficial effect and to help avoid significant adverse effects.</p>
<p>The recommended dose for most adults is 0.25 mg before retiring. A dose of 0.125 mg may be found to be sufficient for some patients (e.g., low body weight). A dose of 0.5 mg should be used only for exceptional patients who do not respond adequately to a trial of a lower dose since the risk of several adverse reactions increases with the size of the dose administered. A dose of 0.5 mg should not be exceeded.</p>
<p>In geriatric and/or debilitated patients the recommended dosage range is 0.125 mg to 0.25 mg. Therapy should be initiated at 0.125 mg in these groups and the 0.25 mg dose should be used only for exceptional patients who do not respond to a trial of the lower dose. A dose of 0.25 mg should not be exceeded in these patients.</p>
<p>As with all medications, the lowest effective dose should be used.</p>
