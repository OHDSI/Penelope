<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<a href="http://"></a>Mechanism of Action<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Olmesartan medoxomil</span><p class="First">Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction 
catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is 
the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that 
include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137788" conceptname="Vascular constriction">vasoconstriction</span>, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, 
cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the 
vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of 
angiotensin II to the AT<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor in vascular smooth 
muscle. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II 
synthesis.</p>
<p>An AT<span class="Sub">2</span> receptor is found also in many tissues, but 
this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. 
Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor than for the AT<span class="Sub">2</span> 
receptor.</p>
<p>Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit 
the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is a mechanism of many 
drugs used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of 
bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because olmesartan medoxomil does 
not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. 
Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known.</p>
<p>Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory 
feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased 
plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the 
effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Hydrochlorothiazide</span><p>Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the 
renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing 
excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. 
Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, 
with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone 
secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum 
potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so 
co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the 
potassium loss associated with these diuretics.</p>
<p>The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is not fully 
understood.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pharmacokinetics<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Bold">General</span><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Olmesartan medoxomil</span><p>Olmesartan medoxomil is rapidly and completely bioactivated by 
ester hydrolysis to olmesartan during absorption from the gastrointestinal 
tract. Olmesartan appears to be eliminated in a biphasic manner with a terminal 
elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours. Olmesartan shows linear 
pharmacokinetics following single oral doses of up to 320 mg and multiple oral 
doses of up to 80 mg. Steady-state levels of olmesartan are achieved within 3 to 
5 days and no accumulation in plasma occurs with once-daily dosing.</p>
<p>The absolute bioavailability of olmesartan is approximately 26%. After oral 
administration, the peak plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of 
olmesartan is reached after 1 to 2 hours. Food does not affect the 
bioavailability of olmesartan.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Hydrochlorothiazide</span><p>When plasma levels have been followed for at least 24 hours, the 
plasma half-life has been observed to vary between 5.6 and 14.8 hours.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Bold">Metabolism and Excretion</span><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Olmesartan medoxomil</span><p>Following the rapid and complete conversion of olmesartan 
medoxomil to olmesartan during absorption, there is virtually no further 
metabolism of olmesartan. Total plasma clearance of olmesartan is 1.3 L/h, with 
a renal clearance of 0.6 L/h. Approximately 35% to 50% of the absorbed dose is 
recovered in urine while the remainder is eliminated in feces via the 
bile.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Hydrochlorothiazide</span><p>Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly 
by the kidney. At least 61% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 
hours.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Bold">Distribution</span><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Olmesartan</span><p>The volume of distribution of olmesartan is approximately 17 L. 
Olmesartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (99%) and does not penetrate red 
blood cells. The protein binding is constant at plasma olmesartan concentrations 
well above the range achieved with recommended doses.</p>
<p>In rats, olmesartan crossed the blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all. 
Olmesartan passed across the placental barrier in rats and was distributed to 
the fetus. Olmesartan was distributed to milk at low levels in rats.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Hydrochlorothiazide</span><p>Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placental but not the blood-brain 
barrier and is excreted in breast milk.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Special Populations<p><span class="Italics">Pediatric:</span>The pharmacokinetics of 
olmesartan have not been investigated in patients &lt;18 years of age.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Geriatric:</span>The pharmacokinetics of olmesartan were 
studied in the elderly (<span class="Underline">&gt;</span>65 years). Overall, maximum plasma concentrations of 
olmesartan were similar in young adults and the elderly. Modest accumulation of 
olmesartan was observed in the elderly with repeated dosing; AUC<span class="Sub">ss,</span><span class="Sub">τ</span> was 33% higher in elderly patients, 
corresponding to an approximate 30% reduction in CL<span class="Sub">R</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Gender:</span>Minor differences were observed in the 
pharmacokinetics of olmesartan in women compared to men. AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> were 10-15% higher in women than in men.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span>:</span>In patients with renal 
insufficiency, serum concentrations of olmesartan were elevated compared to

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pharmacodynamics<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Olmesartan medoxomil</span><p>Olmesartan medoxomil doses of 2.5 to 40 mg inhibit the pressor 
effects of angiotensin I infusion. The duration of the inhibitory effect was 
related to dose, with doses of olmesartan medoxomil &gt;40 mg giving &gt;90% 
inhibition at 24 hours.</p>
<p>Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II and plasma renin 
activity (PRA) increase after single and repeated administration of olmesartan 
medoxomil to healthy subjects and hypertensive patients. Repeated administration 
of up to 80 mg olmesartan medoxomil had minimal influence on aldosterone levels 
and no effect on serum potassium.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Hydrochlorothiazide</span><p>After oral administration of hydrochlorothiazide, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span> begins 
within 2 hours, peaks in about 4 hours and lasts about 6 to 12 hours.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Clinical Trials<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Olmesartan medoxomil</span><p>The antihypertensive effects of olmesartan medoxomil have been 
demonstrated in seven placebo-controlled studies at doses ranging from 2.5 to 80 
mg for 6 to 12 weeks, each showing statistically significant reductions in peak 
and trough blood pressure. A total of 2693 patients (2145 olmesartan medoxomil; 
548 placebo) with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320128" conceptname="Essential hypertension">essential hypertension</span> were studied. Olmesartan medoxomil once 
daily (QD) lowered diastolic and systolic blood pressure. The response was 
dose-related. An olmesartan medoxomil dose of 20 mg daily produces a trough 
sitting BP reduction over placebo of about 10/6 mm Hg and a dose of 40 mg daily 
produces a trough sitting BP reduction over placebo of about 12/7 mm Hg. 
Olmesartan medoxomil doses greater than 40 mg had little additional effect. The 
onset of the antihypertensive effect occurred within 1 week and was largely 
manifest after 2 weeks.</p>
<p>The blood pressure lowering effect was maintained throughout the 24-hour 
period with olmesartan medoxomil once daily, with trough-to-peak ratios for 
systolic and diastolic response between 60 and 80%.</p>
<p>The blood pressure lowering effect of olmesartan medoxomil, with and without 
hydrochlorothiazide, was maintained in patients treated for up to 1 year. There 
was no evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052861" conceptname="Tachyphylaxis">tachyphylaxis</span> during long-term treatment with olmesartan 
medoxomil or rebound effect following abrupt withdrawal of olmesartan medoxomil 
after 1 year of treatment.</p>
<p>The antihypertensive effect of olmesartan medoxomil was similar in men and 
women and in patients older and younger than 65 years. The effect was smaller in 
black patients (usually a low-renin population), as has been seen with other ACE 
inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and beta-blockers. Olmesartan 
medoxomil had an additional blood pressure lowering effect when added to 
hydrochlorothiazide.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Olmesartan 
medoxomil-hydrochlorothiazide</span><p>In clinical trials 1230 patients were exposed to the combination 
of olmesartan medoxomil (2.5 mg to 40 mg) and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg to 25 
mg). These trials included one placebo-controlled factorial trial (n=502) in 
mild-moderate hypertensives with combinations of olmesartan medoxomil (10 mg, 20 
mg, 40 mg or placebo) and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg, 25 mg or placebo). The 
antihypertensive effect of the combination on trough blood pressure was related 
to the dose of each component (see table below).</p>

<p>Once-daily dosing with 20 mg olmesartan medoxomil and 12.5 mg 
hydrochlorothiazide, 40 mg olmesartan medoxomil and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide 
or 40 mg olmesartan medoxomil and 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide produced mean 
placebo-adjusted blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) 
ranging from 17/8 to 24/14 mm Hg.</p>
<p>The onset of the antihypertensive effect occurred within 1 week and was near 
maximal at 4 weeks. The antihypertensive effect was independent of gender, but 
there were too few subjects to identify response differences based on race or

<p>These adverse effects do not appear to have resulted from intrauterine drug 
exposure that has been limited to the first trimester. Mothers whose embryos and 
fetuses are exposed to an angiotensin II receptor antagonist only during the

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Drug Interactions<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Olmesartan medoxomil</span><p>No significant drug interactions were reported in studies in 
which olmesartan medoxomil was co-administered with hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin 
or warfarin in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of olmesartan was not 
significantly altered by the co-administration of antacids [Al(OH)<span class="Sub">3</span>/Mg(OH)<span class="Sub">2</span>]. Olmesartan medoxomil is not 
metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; 
thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce or are metabolized by those 
enzymes are not expected.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Hydrochlorothiazide</span><p>When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact 
with thiazide diuretics:</p>
<p>   <span class="Italics">Alcohol, Barbiturates, Or Narcotics</span>– 
potentiation of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span> may occur.</p>
<p>   <span class="Italics">Antidiabetic Drugs (oral agents and insulin)</span>– 
dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.</p>
<p>   <span class="Italics">Other Antihypertensive Drugs</span>– additive effect 
or potentiation.</p>
<p>   <span class="Italics">Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins</span>– 
absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic 
exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind 
the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal 
tract by up to 85 and 43 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>   <span class="Italics">Corticosteroids, ACTH</span>– intensified electrolyte 
depletion, particularly <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>.</p>
<p>   <span class="Italics">Pressor Amines (e.g. Norepinephrine)</span>– possible 
decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their 
use.</p>
<p>   <span class="Italics">Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Non depolarizing (e.g. 
Tubocurarine)</span>– possible increased responsiveness to the muscle 
relaxant.</p>
<p>   <span class="Italics">Lithium</span>– should not generally be given with 
diuretics. Diuretic agents reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high 
risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium toxicity</span>. Refer to the package insert for lithium preparations 
before use of such preparation with olmesartan 
medoxomil-hydrochlorothiazide.</p>
<p>   <span class="Italics">Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs</span>– in some 
patients the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can 
reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of loop, 
potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when olmesartan 
medoxomil-hydrochlorothiazide tablets and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents 
are used concomitantly, the patients should be observed closely to determine if 
the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.</p>

safety in 1243 hypertensive patients. Treatment with 
olmesartan medoxomil-hydrochlorothiazide was well tolerated, with an incidence 
of adverse events similar to placebo. Events generally were mild, transient and 
had no relationship to the dose of olmesartan medoxomil-hydrochlorothiazide.</p>
<p>In the clinical trials, the overall frequency of adverse events was not 
dose-related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no 
differences between olmesartan medoxomil-hydrochlorothiazide and placebo-treated 
patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse events in all trials of 
hypertensive patients was 2.0% (25/1243) of patients treated with 
olmesartan medoxomil-hydrochlorothiazide and 2.0% (7/342) of patients treated 
with placebo.</p>
<p>In a placebo-controlled clinical trial, the following adverse events reported 
with olmesartan medoxomil-hydrochlorothiazide occurred in &gt;2% of patients, 
and more often on the olmesartan medoxomil-hydrochlorothiazide combination than 
on placebo, regardless of drug relationship:</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">The usual recommended starting dose of BENICAR<span class="Sup">®</span> (olmesartan medoxomil) is 20 mg once daily when used as 
monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring 
further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose may be 
increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have greater effect. 
Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once 
daily. No initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for 
patients with moderate to marked <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (creatinine clearance 
&lt;40mL/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#section-4">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY,</a></span><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"> Special Populations</span></span>). For patients 
with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g., patients treated with 
diuretics, particularly those with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>), BENICAR<span class="Sup">®</span> should be initiated under close medical supervision and 
consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#section-7">WARNINGS</a>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> in Volume- or 
Salt-Depleted Patients</span>).</p>
<p>Hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses between 12.5 mg and 50 mg once 
daily.</p>
<p>The side effects (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#section-7">WARNINGS</a></span>) of BENICAR<span class="Sup">®</span> are 
generally rare and independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide are most 
typically dose-dependent (primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>). Some dose-independent 
phenomena (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192640" conceptname="Pancreatitis">pancreatitis</span>) do occur with hydrochlorothiazide. Therapy with 
any combination of olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide will be 
associated with both sets of dose-independent side effects.</p>
<p>To minimize dose-independent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin 
combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired 
effect with monotherapy.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Replacement Therapy<p>BENICAR HCT<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> 
(olmesartan medoxomil-hydrochlorothiazide) may be substituted for its titrated 
components.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Dose Titration by Clinical Effect<p>BENICAR HCT<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> is 
available in strengths of 20 mg/12.5 mg, 40 mg/12.5 mg and 40 mg/25 mg. A 
patient whose blood pressure is inadequately controlled by BENICAR<span class="Sup">®</span> or hydrochlorothiazide alone may be switched to once daily 
BENICAR HCT<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> (olmesartan 
medoxomil-hydrochlorothiazide).</p>
<p>Dosing should be individualized. Depending on the blood pressure response, 
the dose may be titrated at intervals of 2-4 weeks.</p>
<p>If blood pressure is not controlled by BENICAR<span class="Sup">®</span> alone, 
hydrochlorothiazide may be added starting with a dose of 12.5 mg and later 
titrated to 25 mg once daily.</p>
<p>If a patient is taking hydrochlorothiazide, BENICAR<span class="Sup">®</span> 
may be added starting with a dose of 20 mg once daily and titrated to 40 mg, for 
inadequate blood pressure control. If large doses of hydrochlorothiazide have 
been used as monotherapy and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436375" conceptname="Hypovolemia">volume depletion</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">hyponatremia</span> is present, 
caution should be used when adding BENICAR<span class="Sup">®</span> or switching 
to BENICAR HCT<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> as marked 
decreases in blood pressure may occur (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#section-7">WARNINGS</a>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> in Volume- or Salt-Depleted 
Patients</span>). Consideration should be given to reducing the dose of 
hydrochlorothiazide to 12.5 mg before adding BENICAR<span class="Sup">®</span>. 
The antihypertensive effect of BENICAR HCT<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> is related to the dose of both components over the 
range of 10 mg/12.5 mg to 40 mg/25 mg (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#section-4">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>, Clinical Trials</span>). The dose 
of BENICAR HCT<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> is one tablet 
once daily. More than one tablet daily is not recommended.</p>
<p>BENICAR HCT<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> may be 
administered with other antihypertensive agents.</p>
