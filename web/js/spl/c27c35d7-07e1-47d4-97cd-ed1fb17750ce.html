<h1>Dosage and Administration:</h1>
<p class="First">Always provide client information sheet with prescription. Carefully consider the potential benefits and risk of Metacam and other treatment options before deciding to use Metacam. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual response. Metacam Oral Suspension should be administered initially at 0.09 mg/lb (0.2 mg/kg) body weight only on the first day of treatment. For all treatments after day 1, Metacam Oral Suspension should be administered once daily at a dose of 0.045 mg/lb (0.1 mg/kg). The syringe is calibrated to deliver the daily maintenance dose in pounds.</p>

<h1>Directions for Administration:</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dogs under 10 pounds (4.5 kg)</span></p>
<p>Shake well before use, then remove cap. Particular care should be given with regard to the accuracy of dosing. <span class="Bold">To prevent accidental overdosing of small dogs, administer drops on food only, never directly into the mouth. </span>Carefully measure suspension onto food to assure that the correct dose is given before presentation of the food to the dog. The syringe provided with the meloxicam concentration of 1.5 mg/mL cannot be used to measure doses for dogs weighing less than 5 lbs (2.3 kg).</p>
<p>For dogs less than 5 lbs (2.3 kg), Metacam Oral Suspension can be given using the dropper bottle: one drop for each pound of body weight for the 1.5 mg/mL concentration (two drops for each kilogram of body weight), dropped directly onto the food.</p>
<p>For dogs between 5 - 10 pounds, Metacam Oral Suspension can be given by drops or by using the measuring syringe provided in the package (see dosing procedure below). The syringe fits on to the bottle and has a scale beginning at 5 lbs, designed to deliver the daily maintenance dose (0.05 mg/lb or 0.1 mg/kg). When using the syringe, the dogâ€™s weight should be rounded down to the nearest 5 pound increment. Replace and tighten cap after use.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Dogs over 10 pounds (4.5 kg)</span></p>
<p>Shake well before use then remove cap. Metacam Oral Suspension may be either mixed with food or placed directly into the mouth. Particular care should be given with regard to the accuracy of dosing. Metacam Oral Suspension can be given using the measuring syringe provided in the package (see dosing procedure below). The syringe fits on to the bottle and has a scale in pounds designed to deliver the daily maintenance dose (0.05 mg/lb or 0.1 mg/kg). When using the syringe, the dogâ€™s weight should be rounded down to the nearest 5 pound increment. Alternatively, Metacam Oral Suspension can be given using the dropper bottle: one drop for each pound of body weight for the 1.5 mg/mL concentration (two drops for each kilogram of body weight). Replace and tighten cap after use.</p>

<h1>Precautions:</h1>
<p class="First">The safe use of Metacam Oral Suspension in dogs younger than 6 months of age, dogs used for breeding, or in pregnant or lactating dogs has not been evaluated. Meloxicam is not recommended for use in dogs with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> disorders, as safety has not been established in dogs with these disorders. As a class, cyclo-oxygenase inhibitory NSAIDs may be associated with gastrointestinal, renal and hepatic toxicity. Sensitivity to drug-associated adverse events varies with the individual patient. Dogs that have experienced adverse reactions from one NSAID may experience adverse reactions from another NSAID. Patients at greatest risk for renal toxicity are those that are dehydrated, on concomitant diuretic therapy, or those with existing renal, cardiovascular, and/or hepatic dysfunction. Concurrent administration of potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be carefully approached. NSAIDs may inhibit the prostaglandins that maintain normal homeostatic function. Such anti-prostaglandin effects may result in clinically significant disease in patients with underlying or pre-existing disease that has not been previously diagnosed. Since NSAIDs possess the potential to induce gastrointestinal ulcerations and/or perforations, concomitant use with other anti-inflammatory drugs, such as NSAIDs or corticosteroids, should be avoided. If additional <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> medication is needed after administration of the total daily dose of Metacam Oral Suspension, a non-NSAID or non-corticosteroid class of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> should be considered. The use of another NSAID is not recommended. Consider appropriate washout times when switching from corticosteroid use or from one NSAID to another in dogs. The use of concomitantly protein-bound drugs with Metacam Oral Suspension has not been studied in dogs. Commonly used protein-bound drugs include cardiac, anticonvulsant and behavioral medications. The influence of concomitant drugs that may inhibit metabolism of Metacam Oral Suspension has not been evaluated. Drug compatibility should be monitored in patients requiring adjunctive therapy.</p>

<h1>Clinical Pharmacology:</h1>
<p class="First">Meloxicam has nearly 100% bioavailability when administered orally with food. The terminal elimination half life after a single dose is estimated to be approximately 24 hrs (+/-30%) regardless of route of administration. There is no evidence of statistically significant gender differences in drug pharmacokinetics. Drug bioavailability, volume of distribution, and total systemic clearance remain constant up to 5 times the recommended dose for use in dogs. However, there is some evidence of enhanced drug accumulation and terminal elimination half life prolongation when dogs are dosed for 45 days or longer.</p>
<p>Peak drug concentrations can be expected to occur within about 7.5 hrs after oral administration. Corresponding peak concentration is approximately 0.464 mcg/mL following a 0.2 mg/kg oral dose. The drug is 97% bound to canine plasma proteins.</p>

<h1>Effectiveness:</h1>
<p class="First">The effectiveness of meloxicam was demonstrated in two field studies involving a total of 277 dogs representing various breeds, between six months and sixteen years of age, all diagnosed with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80180" conceptname="Osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</span>. Both of the placebo-controlled, masked studies were conducted for 14 days. All dogs received 0.2 mg/kg on day 1. All dogs were maintained on 0.1 mg/kg oral meloxicam from days 2 through 14 of both studies. Parameters evaluated by veterinarians included lameness, weight-bearing, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> on palpation, and overall improvement. Parameters assessed by owners included mobility, ability to rise, limping, and overall improvement. In the first field study (n=109), dogs showed clinical improvement with statistical significance after 14 days of meloxicam treatment for all parameters. In the second field study (n=48), dogs receiving meloxicam showed a clinical improvement after 14 days of therapy for all parameters; however, statistical significance was  demonstrated only for the overall investigator evaluation on day 7, and for  the owner evaluation on day 14.</p>

<h1>Safety:</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Underline">Six Week Study</span></p>
<p>In a six week target animal safety study, meloxicam was administered orally at 1, 3, and 5X the recommended dose with no significant clinical adverse reactions. Animals in all dose groups (control, 1, 3 and 5X the recommended dose) exhibited some gastrointestinal distress (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>). No treatment-related changes were observed in hematological, blood chemistry, urinalysis, clotting time, or buccal mucosal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4219104" conceptname="Bleeding time">bleeding times</span>. Necropsy results included stomach mucosal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4155911" conceptname="Petechiae">petechiae</span> in one control dog, two dogs at the 3X and one dog at the 5X dose. Other macroscopic changes included areas of congestion or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> of the mucosa of the jejunum or ileum in three dogs at the 1X dose and in two dogs at the 5X dose. Similar changes were also seen in two dogs in the control group. There were no macroscopic small intestinal lesions observed in dogs receiving the 3X dose. Renal enlargement was reported during the necropsy of two dogs receiving the 3X and two receiving the 5X dose.</p>
<p>Microscopic examination of the kidneys revealed minimal degeneration or slight <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280654" conceptname="Necrosis">necrosis</span> at the tip of the papilla in three dogs at the 5X dose. Microscopic examination of the stomach showed inflammatory mucosal lesions, epithelial regenerative <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4296894" conceptname="Hyperplasia">hyperplasia</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4028206" conceptname="Atrophy">atrophy</span>, and submucosal gland <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> in two dogs at the recommended dose, three dogs at the 3X and four dogs at the 5X dose. Small intestinal microscopic changes included minimal focal mucosal erosion affecting the villi, and were sometimes associated with mucosal congestion. These lesions were observed in the ileum of one control dog and in the jejunum of one dog at the recommended dose and two dogs at the 5X dose.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Six Month Study</span></p>
<p>In a six month target animal safety study, meloxicam was administered orally at 1, 3, and 5X the recommended dose with no significant clinical adverse reactions. All animals in all dose groups (controls, 1, 3, and 5X the recommended dose) exhibited some gastrointestinal distress (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>). Treatment related changes seen in hematology and chemistry included decreased red blood cell counts in seven of 24 dogs (four 3X and three 5X dogs), decreased hematocrit in 18 of 24 dogs (including three control dogs), dose related <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4189647" conceptname="Neutrophilia">neutrophilia</span> in one 1X, two 3X and three 5X dogs, evidence of regenerative <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span> in two 3X and one 5X dog. Also noted were increased BUN in two 5X dogs and decreased albumin in one 5X dog.</p>
<p>Endoscopic changes consisted of reddening of the gastric mucosal surface covering less than 25% of the surface area. This was seen in three dogs at the recommended dose, three dogs at the 3X dose and two dogs at the 5X dose. Two control dogs exhibited reddening in conjunction with ulceration of the mucosa covering less than 25% of the surface area.</p>
<p>Gross gastrointestinal necropsy results observed included mild discoloration of the stomach or duodenum in one dog at the 3X and in one dog at the 5X dose. Multifocal pinpoint red foci were observed in the gastric fundic mucosa in one dog at the recommended dose, and in one dog at the 5X dose.</p>
<p>No macroscopic or microscopic renal changes were observed in any dogs receiving meloxicam in this six month study. Microscopic gastrointestinal findings were limited to one dog at the recommended dose, and two dogs at the 3X dose. Mild inflammatory mucosal infiltrate was observed in the duodenum of one dog at the recommended dose. Mild congestion of the fundic mucosa and mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="73001" conceptname="Myositis">myositis</span> of the outer mural musculature of the stomach were observed in two dogs receiving the 3X dose.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">What Kind Of Results Can I Expect When My Dog Is On Metacam For OA?</span></p>
<p>While Metacam is not a cure for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80180" conceptname="Osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</span>, it can control the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> of OA and improve your dogâ€™s mobility.</p>

<p>People should not take Metacam. Keep Metacam and all medication out of reach of children. Call your physician immediately if you accidentally take Metacam.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">How To Give Metacam To Your Dog.</span></p>
<p>The actual dose to be given should be prescribed by the veterinarian.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Directions for Administration:</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Dogs under 10 pounds (4.5 kg)</span></p>
<p>Shake well before use, then remove cap. Particular care should be given with regard to the accuracy of dosing.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">To prevent accidental overdosing of small dogs, administer drops on food only, never directly into the mouth.</span></p>
<p>Carefully measure suspension onto food to assure that the correct dose is given before presentation of the food to the dog. The syringe provided with the meloxicam concentration of 1.5 mg/mL cannot be used to measure doses for dogs weighing less than 5 lbs (2.3 kg). </p>
<p>For dogs less than 5 lbs (2.3 kg), Metacam Oral Suspension can be given using the dropper bottle: one drop for each pound of body weight for the 1.5 mg/mL concentration (two drops for each kilogram of body weight), dropped directly onto the food.</p>
<p>For dogs between 5 - 10 pounds, Metacam Oral Suspension can be given by drops or by using the measuring syringe provided in the package (see dosing procedure below). The syringe fits on to the bottle and has a scale beginning at 5 lbs, designed to deliver the daily maintenance dose (0.05 mg/lb or 0.1 mg/kg). When using the syringe, the dogâ€™s weight should be rounded down to the nearest 5 pound increment. Replace and tighten cap after use.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Dogs over 10 pounds (4.5 kg)</span></p>
<p>Shake well before use then remove cap. Metacam Oral Suspension may be either mixed with food or placed directly into the mouth. Particular care should be given with regard to the accuracy of dosing. Metacam Oral Suspension can be given using the measuring syringe provided in the package (see dosing procedure below). The syringe fits on to the bottle and has a scale in pounds designed to deliver the daily maintenance dose (0.05 mg/lb or 0.1 mg/kg). When using the syringe, the dogâ€™s weight should be rounded down to the nearest 5 pound increment. Alternatively, Metacam Oral Suspension can be given using the dropper bottle: one drop for each pound of body weight for the 1.5 mg/mL concentration (two drops for each kilogram of body weight). Replace and tighten cap after use.</p>
