<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Detroamphetamine sulfate is the dextro isomer of the compound d,l-amphetamine sulfate, a sympathomimetic amine of the amphetamine group. Chemically, dextroamphetamine is d-alpha-methylphenethylamine, and is present in all forms of dextroamphetamine sulfate as the neutral sulfate.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Amphetamines are noncatecholamine, sympathomimetic amines with CNS stimulant activity.  Peripheral actions include elevations of systolic and diastolic blood pressures and weak bronchdilator and respiratory stimulant action.</p>
<p>There is neither specific evidence that clearly establishes the mechanism whereby amphetamines produce mental and behavioral effects in children, nor conclusive evidence regarding how these effects relate to the condition of the central nervous system.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Ingestion of 10 mg of dextroamphetamine sulfate in oral solution form by healthy volunteers produced an average peak dextroamphetamine blood level of 33.2 ng/mL. The half-life was 11.75 hours. The average urinary recovery was 38% in 48 hours. </p>
<p>In 12 healthy subjects, the rate and extent of dextroamphetamine absorption were similar following administration of the sustained release capsule formulation in the fed (58 to 75 gm fat) and fasted state.</p>

Published data are inadequate to determine whether chronic use of amphetamines may cause a similar suppression of growth, however, it is anticipated that they likely have this effect as well. Therefore, growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants, and patients who are not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted.</p>

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Amphetamines may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or vehicles; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly.</p>
<p>Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with dextroamphetamine and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide is available for <span class="Bold">ProCentra</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> (dextroamphetamine sulfate) Oral Solution. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have.  The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.</p>

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Long-term effects of amphetamines in pediatric patients have not been well established.</p>

<p>Clinical experience suggests that in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychotic</span> children, administration of amphetamines may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder.</p>
<p>Amphetamines have been reported to exacerbate motor and phonic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4297396" conceptname="Tic">tics</span> and Tourette’s syndrome. Therefore, clinical evaluation for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4297396" conceptname="Tic">tics</span> and Tourette’s syndrome in children and their families should precede use of stimulant medications.</p>
<p>Data are inadequate to determine whether chronic administration of amphetamines may be associated with growth inhibition; therefore, growth should be monitored during treatment.</p>
<p>Drug treatment is not indicated in all cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4149353" conceptname="Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, predominantly inattentive type">Attention Deficit Disorder</span> with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">Hyperactivity</span> and should be considered only in light of the complete history and evaluation of the child. The decision to prescribe amphetamines should depend on the physician’s assessment of the chronicity and severity of the child’s symptoms and their appropriateness for his or her age. Prescription should not depend solely on the presence of one or more of the behavioral characteristics.</p>
<p>When these symptoms are associated with acute stress reactions, treatment with amphetamines is usually not indicated.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Individual patient response to amphetamines varies widely.  While toxic symptoms occasionally occur as an idiosyncrasy at doses as low as 2 mg, they are rare with doses of less than 15 mg; 30 mg can produce severe reactions, yet doses of 400 to 500 mg are not necessarily fatal.</p>

<h2>Treatment</h2>
<p class="First">Consult with a Certified Poison Control Center for up-to-date guidance and advice.  Management of acute amphetamine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> is largely symptomatic and includes gastric lavage, administration of activated charcoal, administration of a cathartic, and sedation.  Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendation in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases amphetamine excretion, but is believed to increase risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span> if <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439142" conceptname="Myoglobinuria">myoglobinuria</span> is present.  If acute, severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> complicates amphetamine overdosage, administration of intravenous phentolamine (Bedford Laboratories) has been suggested.  However, a gradual <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314171" conceptname="Low blood pressure reading">drop in blood pressure</span> will usually result when sufficient sedation has been achieved.</p>
<p>Chlorpromazine antagonizes the central stimulant effects of amphetamines and can be used to treat amphetamine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>.</p>
