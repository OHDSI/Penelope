<p class="First">Isradipine is a calcium antagonist available for oral administration in capsules containing 2.5 mg or 5 mg. </p>
<p>The structural formula of isradipine is:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="structural formula of isradipine" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=ac51d3e3-ed76-e033-e1d6-1ffbd14d94c2&amp;name=isradipine-capsules-1.jpg"></div>
<p>Chemically, isradipine is 3,5-Pyridinedicarboxylic acid, 4-(4-benzofurazanyl)-1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-, methyl 1-methylethyl ester. Isradipine is a yellow, fine crystalline powder which is odorless or has a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">faint</span> characteristic odor. Isradipine is practically insoluble in water (&lt;10 mg/L at 37ÂºC), but is soluble in ethanol and freely soluble in acetone, chloroform and methylene chloride.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Active Ingredient: </span>isradipine</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Inactive Ingredients: </span>colloidal silicon dioxide, red iron oxide (2.5 mg capsule only, yellow iron oxide, gelatin, anhydrous lactose, magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate, starch (corn), titanium dioxide, black ink: black iron oxide, shellac and potassium hydroxide.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></h2>
<p class="First">Isradipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. It binds to calcium channels with high affinity and specificity and inhibits calcium flux into cardiac and smooth muscle. The effects observed in mechanistic experiments <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>and studied in intact animals and man are compatible with this mechanism of action and are typical of the class.</p>
<p>Except for diuretic activity, the mechanism of which is not clearly understood, the pharmacodynamic effects of isradipine observed in whole animals can also be explained by calcium channel blocking activity, especially dilating effects in arterioles which reduce systemic resistance and lower blood pressure, with a small increase in resting heart rate. Although like other dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, isradipine has negative inotropic effects <span class="Italics">in vitro, </span>studies conducted in intact anesthetized animals have shown that the vasodilating effect occurs at doses lower than those which affect contractility. In patients with normal ventricular function, isradipineâ€™s afterload reducing properties lead to some increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span>.</p>
<p>Effects in patients with impaired ventricular function have not been fully studied.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Clinical Effects</span></h2>
<p class="First">Dose-related reductions in supine and standing blood pressure are achieved within 2-3 hours following single oral doses of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg isradipine, with a duration of action (at least 50% of peak response) of more than 12 hours following administration of the highest dose.</p>
<p>Isradipine has been shown in controlled, double-blind clinical trials to be an effective antihypertensive agent when used as monotherapy, or when added to therapy with thiazide-type diuretics. During chronic administration, divided doses (b.i.d.) in the range of 5-20 mg daily have been shown to be effective, with response at trough (prior to next dose) over 50% of the peak blood pressure effect. The response is dose-related between 5-10 mg daily. Isradipine is equally effective in reducing supine, sitting, and standing blood pressure.</p>
<p>On chronic administration, increases in resting pulse rate averaged about 3-5 beats/min. these increases were not dose-related.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Hemodynamics</span></h2>
<p class="First">In man, peripheral vasodilation produced by isradipine is reflected by decreased systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span> and increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span>. Hemodynamic studies conducted in patients with normal left ventricular function produced, following intravenous isradipine administration, increases in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208254" conceptname="Cardiac index">cardiac index</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4231869" conceptname="Stroke volume">stroke volume</span> index, coronary sinus blood flow, heart rate and peak positive left ventricular dP/dt. Systemic, coronary, and pulmonary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span> was decreased. These studies were conducted with doses of isradipine which produced clinically significant decreases in blood pressure. The clinical consequences of these hemodynamic effects, if any, have not been evaluated.</p>
<p>Effects on heart rate are variable, dependent upon rate of administration and presence of underlying cardiac condition. While increases in both peak positive dP/dt and LV <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4108582" conceptname="Left ventricular ejection fraction">ejection fraction</span> are seen when intravenous isradipine is given, it is impossible to conclude that these represent a positive inotropic effect due to simultaneous changes in preload and afterload. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317576" conceptname="Coronary arteriosclerosis">coronary artery disease</span> undergoing atrial pacing during cardiac catheterization, intravenous isradipine diminished abnormalities of systolic performance. In patients with moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047088" conceptname="Left ventricular systolic dysfunction">left ventricular dysfunction</span>, oral and intravenous isradipine in doses which reduce blood pressure by 12% to 30%, resulted in improvement in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208254" conceptname="Cardiac index">cardiac index</span> without increase in heart rate, and with no change or reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Combination of isradipine and propranolol did not significantly affect left ventricular dP/dt max. The clinical consequences of these effects have not been evaluated.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Electrophysiologic Effects</span></h2>
<p class="First">In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system were seen with the use of isradipine. Electrophysiologic studies were conducted on patients with normal sinus and atrioventricular node function. Intravenous isradipine in doses which reduce systolic blood pressure did not affect PR, QRS, AH* or HV* intervals.</p>
<p>No changes were seen in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318448" conceptname="Second degree atrioventricular block">Wenckebach</span> cycle length, atrial, and ventricular refractory periods. Slight prolongation of QTc interval of 3% was seen in one study. Effects on sinus node recovery time (CSNRT) were mild or not seen.</p>
<p>In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317302" conceptname="Sinus node dysfunction">sick sinus syndrome</span>, at doses which significantly reduced blood pressure, intravenous isradipine resulted in no depressant effect on sinus and atrioventricular node function.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</span></h2>
<p class="First">Isradipine is 90%-95% absorbed and is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism, resulting in a bioavailability of about 15%-24%. Isradipine is detectable in plasma within 20 minutes after administration of single oral doses of 2.5-20 mg, and peak concentrations of approximately 1 ng/mL/mg dosed occur about 1.5 hours after drug administration. Administration of isradipine with food significantly increases the time to peak by about an hour, but has no effect on the total bioavailability (area under the curve) of the drug. Isradipine is 95% bound to plasma proteins. Both peak plasma concentration and AUC exhibit a linear relationship to dose over the 0-20 mg dose range. The elimination of isradipine is biphasic with an early half-life of 1 Â½-2 hours, and a terminal half-life of about 8 hours. The total body clearance of isradipine is 1.4 L/min and the apparent volume od disturbance is 3 L/kg.</p>
<p>Isradipine is completely metabolized prior to excretion, and no unchanged drug is detected in the urine. Six metabolites have been characterized in blood and urine, with the mono acids of the pyridine derivative and a cyclic lactone product accounting for &gt;75% fo the material identified. Approximately 60%-65% of an administered dose is excreted in the urine and 25%-30% in the feces. Mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (creatinine clearance 30 to 80 mL/min) increases the bioavailability (AUC) of isradipine by 45%. Progressive deterioration reverses this trend, and patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> (creatinine clearance &lt;10 mL/min) who have been on hemodialysis show a 20% to 50% lower AUC than healthy volunteers. No pharmacokinetic information is available in drug therapy during hemodialysis. In elderly patients C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC are increased by 13% and 40%, respectively; in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>, C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC are increased by 32% and 52%, respectively (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID_a0c07945-fbce-176c-d57a-2f54403ddde3">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>Â ).</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Nitroglycerin: </span></span>Isradipine has been safely coadministered with nitroglycerin.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hydrochlorothiazide: </span></span>A study in normal healthy volunteers has shown that concomitant administration of isradipine and hydrochlorothiazide does not result in altered pharmacokinetics of either drug. In a study in hypertensive patients, addition of isradipine to existing hydrochlorothiazide therapy did not result in any unexpected adverse effects, and isradipine had an additional antihypertensive effect.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Propranolol: </span></span>In a single dose study in normal volunteers, co-administration of propranolol had a small effect on the rate but no effect on the extent of isradipine bioavailability. Significant increases in AUC (27%) and C<span class="Sub">max</span> (58%) and decreases in t<span class="Sub">max</span> (23%) of propranolol were noted in this study. However, concomitant administration of 5 mg b.i.d. isradipine and 40 mg b.i.d. propranolol to healthy volunteers under steady-state conditions had no relevant effect on either drugâ€™s bioavailability. AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> differences were &lt;20% between isradipine given singly and in combination with propranolol, and between propranolol given singly and in combination with isradipine.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Cimetidine:</span></span> In a study in healthy volunteers, a one-week course of cimetidine at 400 mg b.i.d. with a single 5 mg dose of isradipine on the sixth day showed an increase in isradipine mean peak plasma concentrations (36%) and significant increase in area under the curve (50%). If isradipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, careful monitoring for adverse reactions is advised and downward dose adjustment may be required.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Rifampicin:</span></span> In a study with healthy volunteers, a six-day course of rifampicin at 600 mg/day followed by a single 5 mg dose of isradipine resulted in a reduction in isradipine levels to below detectable limits. If rifampicin therapy is required, isradipine concentrations and therapeutic effects are likely to be markedly reduced or abolished as a consequence of increased metabolism and higher clearance of isradipine.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Warfarin:</span></span> In a study with healthy volunteers, no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacodynamic interaction</span> between isradipine and racemic warfarin was seen when two single oral doses of warfarin (0.7 mg/kg body weight) were administered during 11 days of multiple-dose treatment with 5 mg b.i.d. isradipine. Neither racemic warfarin nor isradipine binding to plasma proteins <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> was altered by the addition of the other drug.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Digoxin: </span></span>The concomitant administration of isradipine and digoxin in a single-dose pharmacokinetic study did not affect renal, nonrenal and total body clearance of digoxin.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Fentanyl Anesthesia: </span></span>Severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> has been reported during fentanyl anesthesia with concomitant use of a beta-blocker and a calcium channel blocker. Even though such interactions have not been seen in clinical studies with isradipine, an increased volume of circulating fluids might be required if such an interaction were to occur.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</span></h2>
<p class="First">Treatment of male rats for 2 years with 2.5, 12.5, or 62.5 mg/kg/day isradipine admixed with the diet (approximately 6, 31, and 156 times the maximum recommended daily dose based on a 50 kg man) resulted in dose dependent increases in the incidence of benign Leydig cell tumors and testicular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4296894" conceptname="Hyperplasia">hyperplasia</span> relative to untreated control animals. These findings, which were replicated in a subsequent experiment, may have been indirectly related to an effect of isradipine on circulating gonadotropin levels in the rats; a comparable endocrine effect was not evident in male patients receiving therapeutic doses of the drug on a chronic basis. Treatment of mice for two years with 2.5, 15, or 80 mg/kg/day isradipine in the diet (approximately 6, 38, and 200 times the maximum recommended dose based on a 50 kg man) showed no evidence of oncogenicity. There was no evidence of mutagenic potential based on the results of a battery of mutagenic tests. No effect on fertility was observed in male and female rats treated with up to 60 mg/kg/day isradipine.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span></h1>
<p class="First">Minimal empirical data are available on isradipine overdosage. Three individual <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4219484" conceptname="Suicide attempt">suicide attempts</span> with dosages of isradipine reported to be from 20 mg up to 100 mg resulted in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4061577" conceptname="Lethargy">lethargy</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4007310" conceptname="Sinus tachycardia">sinus tachycardia</span> and, in the case of the person ingesting 100 mg, transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> which responded to fluid therapy. A foreign report of the ingestion of 200 mg of isradipine with ethanol resulted only in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318566" conceptname="Flushing">flushing</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span> with ST <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> on ECG, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, all of which were reversible. The ingestion of 5 mg isradipine by a 22-month child and the accidental ingestion of 100 mg of isradipine by a 58-year old female did not result in any sequelae.</p>
<p>Available data suggest that, as with other dihydropyridines, overdosage with isradipine might result in excessive peripheral vasodilation with subsequent marked and probably prolonged systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">Emesis</span>, gastric lavage, administration of activated charcoal followed in 30 minutes by a saline cathartic would be reasonable therapy. Isradipine is highly protein-bound and not removed by hemodialysis. Overdosage characterized by clinically significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> should be treated with active cardiovascular support including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of lower extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. A vasoconstrictor (such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or levarterenol) may be helpful in restoring a normotensive state, provided that there is no contraindication to its use.</p>
<p>Refractory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> or AV conduction disturbances may be treated with intravenous calcium salts, or glucagon. Cimetidine should be withheld in such instances due to the risk of further increasing plasma isradipine levels.</p>
<p>Significant lethality was observed in mice given oral doses of over 200 mg/kg and rabbits given about 50 mg/kg of isradipine. Rats tolerated doses of over 2000 mg/kg without effects on survival.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span></h1>
<p class="First">The dosage of isradipine should be individualized. The recommended initial dose of isradipine is 2.5 mg b.i.d. alone or in combination with a thiazide diuretic. An antihypertensive response usually occurs within 2-3 hours. Maximal response may require 2-4 weeks. If a satisfactory reduction in blood pressure does not occur after this period, the dose may be adjusted in increments of 5 mg/day at 2-4 week intervals up to a maximum of 20 mg/day. Most patients, however, show no additional response to doses above 10 mg/day, and adverse effects are increased in frequency above 10 mg/day.</p>
<p>The bioavailability of isradipine (increased AUC) is increased in elderly patients (above 65 years of age), patients with hepatic functional impairment, and patients with mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>. Ordinarily, the starting dose should still be 2.5 mg b.i.d. in these patients.</p>
