<h2>CHEMISTRY</h2>
<p class="First">Sucraid is a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260836" conceptname="Blanching of skin">pale</span> yellow to colorless, clear solution with a pleasant sweet taste. Each milliliter (mL) of Sucraid contains 8,500 International Units (I.U.) of the enzyme sacrosidase, the active ingredient. The chemical name of this enzyme is ß,D-fructofuranoside fructohydrolase. The enzyme is derived from baker’s yeast (<span class="Italics">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>).</p>
<p>It has been reported that the primary amino acid structure of this protein consists of 513 amino acids with an apparent molecular weight of 100,000 g/mole for the glycosylated monomer (range 66,000-116,000 g/mole). Reports also suggest that the protein exists in solution as a monomer, dimer, tetramer, and octomer ranging from 100,000 g/mole to 800,000 g/mole. It has an isoelectric point (pI) of 4.5.</p>
<p>Sucraid may contain small amounts of papain. Papain is known to cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergic reactions</span> in some people. Papain is a protein-cleaving enzyme that is introduced in the manufacturing process to digest the cell wall of the yeast and may not be completely removed during subsequent process steps.</p>
<p>Sucraid contains sacrosidase in a vehicle comprised of glycerol (50% wt/wt), water, and citric acid to maintain the pH at 4.0 to 4.7. Glycerol (glycerin) in the amount consumed in the recommended doses of Sucraid has no expected toxicity.</p>
<p>This enzyme preparation is fully soluble with water, milk, and infant formula (DO NOT HEAT SOLUTIONS CONTAINING SUCRAID). Do not put Sucraid in warm or hot liquids.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID) is a chronic, 
autosomal recessive, inherited, phenotypically heterogeneous disease with very 
variable enzyme activity. CSID is usually characterized by a complete or almost 
complete lack of endogenous sucrase activity, a very marked reduction in 
isomaltase activity, a moderate decrease in maltase activity and normal lactase 
levels.</p>
<p>Sucrase is naturally produced in the brush border of the small intestine, 
primarily the distal duodenum and jejunum. Sucrase hydrolyzes the disaccharide 
sucrose into its component monosaccharides, glucose and fructose. Isomaltase 
breaks down disaccharides from starch into simple sugars. Sucraid does not 
contain isomaltase.</p>
<p>In the absence of endogenous human sucrase, as in CSID, sucrose is not 
metabolized. Unhydrolyzed sucrose and starch are not absorbed from the intestine 
and their presence in the intestinal lumen may lead to osmotic retention of 
water. This may result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">loose stools</span>.</p>
<p>Unabsorbed sucrose in the colon is fermented by bacterial flora to produce 
increased amounts of hydrogen, methane and water. As a consequence, excessive 
gas, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442597" conceptname="Swollen abdomen">bloating</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal cramps</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> may occur.</p>
<p>Chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194993" conceptname="Intestinal malabsorption">malabsorption</span> of disaccharides may result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090739" conceptname="Nutritional disorder">malnutrition</span>. 
Undiagnosed/untreated CSID patients often fail to thrive and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> behind in 
their expected growth and development curves. Previously, the treatment of CSID 
has required the continual use of a strict sucrose-free diet.</p>
<p>CSID is often difficult to diagnose. Approximately 4% to 10% of pediatric 
patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">chronic diarrhea</span> of unknown origin have CSID. Measurement of 
expired breath hydrogen under controlled conditions following a sucrose 
challenge (a measurement of excess hydrogen excreted in exhalation) in CSID 
patients has shown levels as great as 6 times that in normal subjects.</p>
<p>A generally accepted clinical definition of CSID is a condition characterized 
by the following: stool pH &lt;6, an increase in breath hydrogen of &gt; 10ppm 
when challenged with sucrose after fasting and a negative lactose breath test. 
However, because of the difficulties in diagnosing CSID, it may be warranted to 
conduct a short therapeutic trial (e.g., one week) to assess response in patients 
suspected of having CSID.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34092-7">
<a name="clinStudies"></a><a name="section-3"></a><p></p>
<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First">A two-phase (dose response preceded by a breath hydrogen phase) 
double-blind, multi-site, crossover trial was conducted in 28 patients (aged 4 
months to 11.5 years) with confirmed CSID. During the dose response phase, the 
patients were challenged with an ordinary sucrose-containing diet while 
receiving each of four doses of sacrosidase: full strength (9000 I.U./mL) and 
three dilutions (1:10 [900 I.U./mL], 1:100 [90 I.U./mL], and 1:1000 [9 I.U./mL]) 
in random order for a period of 10 days. Patients who weighed no more than 15 kg 
received 1 mL per meal; those weighing more than 15 kg received 2 mL per meal. 
The dose did not vary with age or sucrose intake.</p>
<p>A dose-response relationship was shown between the two higher and the two 
lower doses. The two higher doses of sacrosidase were associated with 
significantly fewer total stools and higher proportions of patients having lower 
total symptom scores, the primary efficacy end-points. In addition, higher doses 
of sacrosidase were associated with a significantly greater number of hard and 
formed stools as well as with fewer watery and soft stools, the secondary 
efficacy end-points.</p>
<p>Analysis of the overall symptomatic response as a function of age indicated 
that in CSID patients up to 3 years of age, 86% became asymptomatic. In patients 
over 3 years of age, 77% became asymptomatic. Thus, the therapeutic response did 
not differ significantly according to age.</p>
<p>A second study of similar design and execution as the first used 4 different 
dilutions of sacrosidase 1:100 (90 I.U./mL), 1:1000 (9 I.U./mL), 1:10,000 (0.9 
I.U./mL), and 1:100,000 (0.09 I.U./mL). There were inconsistent results with 
regards to the primary efficacy parameters.</p>
<p>In both trials, however, patients showed a marked decrease in breath hydrogen 
output when they received sacrosidase in comparison to placebo.</p>

</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42232-9">
<a name="precautions"></a><a name="section-7"></a><p></p>
<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Care should be taken to administer initial doses of Sucraid near 
(within a few minutes of travel) a facility where acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span> 
can be adequately treated. Alternatively, the patient may be tested for 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> to Sucraid through skin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4269361" conceptname="Friction burn">abrasion</span> testing. Should symptoms of 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> appear, discontinue medication and initiate symptomatic and 
supportive therapy. </p>
<p>Skin testing as a rechallenge has been used to verify <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> in one 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatic</span> child who displayed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314754" conceptname="Wheezing">wheezing</span> after oral sacrosidase.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34072-9">
<a name="general"></a><a name="section-7.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>GENERAL</h2>
<p class="First">Although Sucraid provides replacement therapy for the deficient sucrase, it does not provide specific replacement therapy for the deficient isomaltase. Therefore, restricting starch in the diet may still be necessary to reduce symptoms as much as possible. The need for dietary starch restriction for patients using Sucraid should be evaluated in each patient. <br></p>
<p>It may sometimes be clinically inappropriate, difficult, or inconvenient to perform a small bowel biopsy or breath hydrogen test to make a definitive diagnosis of CSID. If the diagnosis is in doubt, it may be warranted to conduct a short therapeutic trial (e.g., one week) with Sucraid to assess response in a patient suspected of sucrase deficiency.</p>
<p>The effects of Sucraid have not been evaluated in patients with secondary (acquired) disaccharidase deficiencies.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34076-0">
<a name="section-7.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</h2>
<p class="First">See <a href="#section-13"> Patient Package Insert</a>. Patients should be instructed to 
discard bottles of Sucraid 4 weeks after opening due to the potential for 
bacterial growth. For the same reason, patients should be advised to rinse the 
measuring scoop with water after each use. </p>
<p>Sucraid is fully soluble with water, milk, and infant formula, but it is 
important to note that this product is <span class="Bold">sensitive to heat.</span> Sucraid should not be 
reconstituted or consumed with fruit juice, since its acidity may reduce the 
enzyme activity.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-7.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>USE IN DIABETICS</h2>
<p class="First">The use of Sucraid will enable the products of sucrose hydrolysis, 
glucose and fructose, to be absorbed. This fact must be carefully considered in 
planning the diet of diabetic CSID patients using Sucraid.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34075-2">
<a name="section-7.4"></a><p></p>
<h2>LABORATORY TESTS</h2>
<p class="First">The definitive test for diagnosis of CSID is the measurement of 
intestinal disaccharidases following small bowel biopsy. </p>
<p>Other tests used alone may be inaccurate: for example, the breath hydrogen 
test (high incidence of false negatives) or oral sucrose tolerance test (high 
incidence of false positives). Differential urinary disaccharide testing has 
been reported to show good agreement with small intestinal biopsy for diagnosis 
of CSID.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34073-7">
<a name="section-7.5"></a><p></p>
<h2>DRUG INTERACTIONS</h2>
<p class="First">Neither drug-drug nor drug-food interactions are expected or have 
been reported with the use of Sucraid. However, Sucraid should not be 
reconstituted or consumed with fruit juice, since its acidity may reduce the 
enzyme activity.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34083-6">
<a name="section-7.6"></a><p></p>
<h2>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY</h2>
<p class="First">Long-term studies in animals with Sucraid have not been performed 
to evaluate the carcinogenic potential. Studies to evaluate the effect of 
Sucraid on fertility or its mutagenic potential have not been performed.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42228-7">
<a name="section-7.7"></a><p></p>
<h2>PREGNANCY</h2>
<p class="First">Teratogenic effects. Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction 
studies have not been conducted with Sucraid. Sucraid is not expected to cause 
fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or to affect reproductive 
capacity. Sucraid should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly 
needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34080-2">
<a name="section-7.8"></a><p></p>
<h2>NURSING MOTHERS</h2>
<p class="First">The Sucraid enzyme is broken down in the stomach and intestines, 
and the component amino acids and peptides are then absorbed as nutrients.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34081-0">
<a name="section-7.9"></a><p></p>
<h2>PEDIATRIC USE</h2>
<p class="First">Sucraid has been used in patients as young as 5 months of age. 
Evidence in one controlled trial in primarily pediatric patients shows that 
Sucraid is safe and effective for the treatment of the genetically acquired 
sucrase deficiency, which is part of CSID.</p>

<h2>The purpose of your medicine:</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"></span>Sucraid is an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of the 
genetically determined sucrase deficiency, which is part of congenital 
sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID). CSID is a condition where your body lacks 
the enzymes needed to break down and absorb sucrose (table sugar) and other 
sugars from starch.</p>
<p>The symptoms of CSID often include frequent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">watery diarrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal pain</span>, 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442597" conceptname="Swollen abdomen">bloating</span>, and gas. In many cases, the symptoms of CSID are similar to other 
medical problems. Only your doctor can make a definite diagnosis of CSID. </p>
<p>Sucraid can help improve the breakdown and absorption of sucrose (table 
sugar) from the intestine and can help relieve the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302537" conceptname="Digestive system finding">gastrointestinal symptoms</span> of 
CSID.</p>
<p>Sucraid does not break down some sugars resulting from the digestion of 
starch. Therefore, you may need to restrict the amount of starch in your diet. 
Your doctor will tell you if you should restrict the amount of starch in your 
diet.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">

covers a dropper dispensing tip. Remove the outer cap and measure out the 
required dose. Reseal the bottle after each use by replacing and twisting the 
cap until tight.</p>
<p>Write down the date the sealed bottle is first opened in the space provided 
on the bottle label. Always throw away the bottle four weeks after first opening 
it because Sucraid contains no preservatives. For the same reason, you should 
rinse the measuring scoop with water after each time you finish using it.</p>
<p>To get the full benefits of this medicine, it is very important to take 
Sucraid as your doctor has prescribed. The usual dosage is 1 to 2 milliliters 
(mL) with each meal or snack:</p>
<p>1 mL = 1 full measuring scoop (28 drops from the bottle tip) and 2 mL = 2 
full measuring scoops (56 drops from the bottle tip).</p>
<p>Measure your dose with the measuring scoop provided (see Figure 1). Do not 
use a kitchen teaspoon or other measuring device since it will not measure an 
accurate dose.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Figure 1. Measure dose with measuring scoop.</span></p>

<p>Mix your dose in 2 to 4 ounces of water, milk, or infant formula (see Figure 
2). Sucraid should not be dissolved in or taken with fruit juice.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">NEVER HEAT SUCRAID OR PUT IT IN WARM OR HOT BEVERAGES OR INFANT FORMULA.

<p>It is recommended that approximately half of your dosage be taken at the 
beginning of each meal or snack and the remainder of your dosage be taken during 
the meal or snack.</p>
