<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="43679-0">
<a name="s12"></a><a name="section-5.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Methadone hydrochloride is a μ agonist; a synthetic opioid analgesic with multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of morphine, the most prominent of which involve the central nervous system and organs composed of smooth muscle. The principal therapeutic uses for methadone are for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> and for detoxification or maintenance in opioid addiction. The methadone abstinence syndrome, although qualitatively similar to that of morphine, differs in that the onset is slower, the course is more prolonged, and the symptoms are less severe. Some data also indicate that methadone acts as an antagonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. The contribution of NMDA receptor antagonism to methadone's efficacy is unknown. Other NMDA receptor antagonists have been shown to produce neurotoxic effects in animals.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s14"></a><a name="section-5.2.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Absorption:</h3>
<p class="First">Methadone Hydrochloride Injection is intended for parenteral (intravenous, subcutaneous and intramuscular) administration. Methadone pharmacokinetics following subcutaneous and intramuscular administration have not been systematically studied and differences among the various parenteral routes have not been well characterized. As with many drugs, absorption into the systemic circulation may vary with subcutaneous and intramuscular administration.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s15"></a><a name="section-5.2.2"></a><p></p>
<h3>Distribution:</h3>
<p class="First">Methadone is a lipophilic drug and the steady state volume of distribution ranges between 2 -6 L/kg. In plasma, methadone is predominantly bound to α<span class="Sub">1</span>-acid glycoprotein (85% - 90%). Methadone is secreted in saliva, breast milk, amniotic fluid and umbilical cord plasma.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s16"></a><a name="section-5.2.3"></a><p></p>
<h3>Metabolism:</h3>
<p class="First">Methadone is primarily metabolized by N-demethylation to an inactive metabolite, 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidene (EDDP). Cytochrome P450 enzymes, primarily CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP2D6, are responsible for conversion of methadone to EDDP and other inactive metabolites, which are excreted mainly in urine.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s17"></a><a name="section-5.2.4"></a><p></p>
<h3>Excretion:</h3>
<p class="First">Elimination of methadone is mediated by extensive biotransformation, followed by renal and fecal excretion. After single intravenous dose administration the plasma clearance of methadone ranged between 3-10 L/h and the terminal half-life (t<span class="Sub">½</span>) ranged between 8 - 59 hours. Methadone has been known to persist in the liver and other tissues. Slow release from the liver and other tissues may prolong the duration of methadone action despite low plasma concentrations.</p>

<a name="s19"></a><a name="section-5.3.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Pregnancy</h3>
<p class="First">There are no pharmacokinetic studies of parenteral methadone in pregnancy. The disposition of oral methadone has been studied in approximately 30 pregnant patients in 2<span class="Sup">nd</span> and 3<span class="Sup">rd</span> trimesters. Elimination of methadone was significantly changed in pregnancy. Total body clearance of methadone was increased in pregnant patients compared to the same patients postpartum or to non-pregnant opioid-dependent women. The terminal half-life of methadone is decreased during second and third trimesters. The decrease in plasma half-life and increased clearance of methadone resulting in lower methadone trough levels during pregnancy can lead to withdrawal symptoms in some pregnant patients. The dosage may need to be increased or the dosing interval decreased in pregnant patients receiving methadone (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#s88">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>

<h3><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal Impairment</span></h3>
<p class="First">Methadone pharmacokinetics have not been extensively evaluated in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>. Unchanged methadone and its metabolites are excreted in urine to a variable degree. Methadone is a basic (pKa=9.2) compound and the luminal pH of the urinary tract can affect its extraction from plasma. Urine acidification has been shown to increase renal elimination of methadone. Forced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span>, peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, or charcoal hemoperfusion have not been established as beneficial for increasing methadone or metabolite elimination.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">(see <a href="#s42">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</a>)</span></p>
<p>Methadone undergoes hepatic N-demethylation by cytochrome P-450 isoforms, principally CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent CYP2D6. Coadministration of methadone with inducers of these enzymes may result in more rapid methadone metabolism and potentially, decreased effects of methadone. Conversely, administration with CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors may reduce metabolism and potentiate methadone's effects. Therefore, drugs administered concomitantly with methadone should be evaluated for interaction potential (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s42">Drug Interactions</a></span>)</p>

<h2>Cardiac Conduction Effects</h2>
<div class="Warning">
<a name="e30"></a><a name="section-8.1.1"></a><p></p>
<p class="First">Laboratory studies, both <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> and <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>, have demonstrated that methadone inhibits cardiac potassium channels and prolongs the QT interval. Cases of QT interval prolongation and serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135823" conceptname="Torsades de pointes">torsades de pointes</span>) have been observed during treatment with methadone. These cases appear to be more commonly associated with, but not limited to, higher dose treatment (&gt; 200 mg/day). Most cases involve patients being treated for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> with large, multiple daily doses of methadone, although cases have been reported in patients receiving doses commonly used for maintenance treatment of opioid addiction.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="e31"></a><a name="section-8.1.1"></a><p></p>
<p class="First">Methadone should be administered with particular caution to patients already at risk for development of prolonged QT interval (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314658" conceptname="Cardiomegaly">cardiac hypertrophy</span>, concomitant diuretic use, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4098604" conceptname="Hypomagnesemia">hypomagnesemia</span>). Careful monitoring is recommended when using methadone in patients with a history of cardiac conduction abnormalities, those taking medications affecting cardiac conduction, and in other cases where history or physical exam suggest an increased risk of dysrhythmia. QT prolongation has also been reported in patients with no prior cardiac history who have received high doses of methadone. Patients developing QT prolongation while on methadone treatment should be evaluated for the presence of modifiable risk factors, such as concomitant medications with cardiac effects, drugs which might cause electrolyte abnormalities, and drugs which might act as inhibitors of methadone metabolism. For use of methadone to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, the risk of QT prolongation and development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">dysrhythmias</span> should be weighed against the benefit of adequate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> management and the availability of alternative therapies.</p>
<p>Methadone treatment for analgesic therapy in patients with acute or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436096" conceptname="Chronic pain">chronic pain</span> should only be initiated if the potential analgesic or palliative care benefit of treatment with methadone has been considered to outweigh the risk of QT prolongation that has been reported with high doses of methadone.</p>
<p>The use of methadone in patients already known to have a prolonged QT interval has not been systematically studied.</p>
<p>In using methadone an individualized benefit to risk assessment should be carried out and should include evaluation of patient presentation and complete medical history. For patients judged to be at risk, careful monitoring of cardiovascular status, including QT prolongation and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">dysrhythmias</span> and those described previously should be performed.</p>

<h2>Incomplete Cross-Tolerance Between Methadone and Other Opioids</h2>
<p class="First">Patients tolerant to other opioids may be incompletely tolerant to methadone. Incomplete cross-tolerance is a particular concern for patients tolerant to other μ-opioid agonists when converting to methadone, making determination of dosing during opioid conversion complex. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Deaths</span> have been reported during conversion from chronic, high dose treatment with other opioid agonists. Therefore, it is critical to understand the pharmacokinetics of methadone when converting patients from other opioids (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s88">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>, <a href="#t1">Tables 1</a> and <a href="#t2">2</a>, for appropriate conversion schedules). A high degree of "opioid tolerance" does not eliminate the possibility of methadone toxicity.</p>

<h2>Misuse, Abuse, and Diversion of Opioids</h2>
<p class="First">Methadone is a μ-agonist opioid with an abuse liability similar to that of morphine and is a Schedule II controlled substance. Methadone, like morphine and other opioids used for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, has the potential for being abused and is subject to criminal diversion.</p>
<p>Methadone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when dispensing Methadone Hydrochloride Injection in situations where the clinician is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion.</p>
<p>Concerns about abuse, addiction, diversion should not prevent the proper management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>.</p>

<p class="First">Methadone given on a fixed-dose schedule may have a narrow therapeutic index in certain patient populations, especially when combined with other drugs, and should be reserved for cases where the benefits of opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> outweigh the known potential risks of cardiac conduction abnormalities, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, altered mental states and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span>. Methadone Hydrochloride Injection should be used with caution in elderly and debilitated patients; patients who are known to be sensitive to central nervous system depressants, such as those with cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span>; and in patients with comorbid conditions or concomitant medications which may predispose to dysrhythmia.</p>
<p>Selection of patients for treatment with methadone should be governed by the same principles that apply to the use of other parenteral opioids (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s27">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</a></span>). Physicians should individualize treatment in every case (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s88">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>), taking into account the high degree of interpatient variability in response to and metabolism of methadone.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> results indicate that methadone undergoes hepatic N-demethylation by cytochrome P450 enzymes, principally CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent CYP2D6. Coadministration of methadone with inducers of these enzymes may result in a more rapid metabolism and potential for decreased effects of methadone, whereas administration with inhibitors may reduce metabolism and potentiate methadone's effects. Therefore, drugs administered concomitantly with methadone should be evaluated for interaction potential; clinicians are advised to evaluate individual response to drug therapy.</p>

<h2>Tolerance and Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">Dependence</span></h2>

<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Teratogenic effects:</span> Pregnancy Category C. There are no controlled studies of methadone use in pregnant women that can be used to establish safety. However, an expert review of published data on experiences with methadone use during pregnancy by TERIS - the Teratogen Information System -concluded that maternal use of methadone during pregnancy as part of a supervised, therapeutic regimen is unlikely to pose a substantial teratogenic risk (quantity and quality of data assessed as “limited to fair?), however, the data are insufficient to state that there is no risk (TERIS, last reviewed October, 2002). Pregnant women involved in methadone maintenance programs have been reported to have significantly improved prenatal care, improved fetal outcomes, and reduced mortality when compared to pregnant women using illicit drugs. Several factors complicate the interpretation of investigations of the children of women who took methadone during pregnancy. These include: the maternal use of illicit drugs, other maternal factors such as nutrition, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, and psychosocial circumstances, limited information regarding dose and duration of methadone use during pregnancy, and the fact that most maternal exposure appears to occur after the first trimester of pregnancy. In addition, reported studies generally compare the benefit of methadone to the risk of untreated addiction to illicit drugs; the relevance of these findings to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> patients prescribed methadone during pregnancy is unclear.</p>
<p>Methadone has been detected in amniotic fluid and cord plasma at concentrations proportional to maternal plasma and in newborn urine at lower concentrations than corresponding maternal urine.</p>
<p>A retrospective series of 101 pregnant opiate-dependent women who underwent inpatient opiate detoxification with methadone did not demonstrate any increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4067106" conceptname="Miscarriage">miscarriage</span> in the 2<span class="Sup">nd</span> trimester or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4086393" conceptname="Premature delivery">premature delivery</span> in the 3<span class="Sup">rd</span> trimester.</p>
<p>Several studies have suggested that infants born to narcotic-addicted women treated with methadone during all or part of pregnancy have been found to have decreased fetal growth with reduced birth weight, length, and/or head circumference compared to controls. The growth deficit does not appear to persist into later childhood. However, children born to women treated with methadone during pregnancy have been shown to demonstrate mild but persistent deficits in performance on psychometric and behavioral tests.</p>
<p>Methadone should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<p>Additional information on the potential risks of methadone may be derived from animal data. Methadone does not appear to be teratogenic in the rat or rabbit models. However, following large doses, methadone produced teratogenic effects in the guinea pig, hamster and mouse. One published study found that in hamster fetuses, subcutaneous methadone doses of 31 mg/kg or greater (estimated exposure was approximately 2 times a human daily oral dose of 120 mg/day on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, or equivalent to a human daily intravenous dose of 120 mg/day) on day 8 of gestation produced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4309376" conceptname="Exencephaly">exencephaly</span> and neurological effects. Some of the reported effects were observed at doses that were maternally toxic. In another study, a single subcutaneous dose of 22-24 mg/kg methadone (estimated exposure was approximately equivalent to a human daily oral dose of 120 mg/day on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis; or half a human daily intravenous dose of 120 mg/day) on day 9 of gestation in mice also produced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4309376" conceptname="Exencephaly">exencephaly</span> in 11% of the embryos.

<p>Abnormal fetal nonstress tests (NSTs) have been reported to occur more frequently when the test is performed 1-2 hours after a maintenance dose of methadone in late pregnancy compared to controls. Published animal studies suggest that perinatal exposure to opioids including methadone may alter neuronal development and behavior in the offspring. Perinatal methadone exposure in rats has been linked to alterations in learning ability, motor activity, thermal regulation, nociception responses and sensitivity to other drugs. Additional animal data demonstrates evidence for neurochemical changes in the brains of methadone-treated offspring, including the cholinergic, dopaminergic, noradrenergic and serotonergic systems.</p>

The safety of breastfeeding while taking oral methadone is also controversial. At maternal oral doses of 10-80 mg/day, methadone concentrations from 50 to 570 ug/L in milk have been reported, which, in the majority of samples, were lower than maternal serum drug concentrations at steady state. Peak methadone levels in milk occur approximately 4-5 hours after an oral dose. Based on an average milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day, an infant would consume approximately 17.4 ug/kg/day, which is approximately 2-3% of the oral maternal dose. Methadone has been detected in very low plasma concentrations in some infants whose mothers were taking methadone. Women on high dose methadone maintenance, who are already breast feeding, should be counseled to wean breast-feeding gradually in order to prevent neonatal abstinence syndrome. Methadone-treated mothers considering nursing an opioid-naïve infant should be counseled of the presence of methadone in breast milk.</p>
<p>Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from methadone, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<h2>Treatment</h2>
<p class="First">Primary attention should be given to the reestablishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. If a non-tolerant person takes a large dose of methadone, effective opioid antagonists are available to counteract the potentially lethal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>. <span class="Bold">The physician must remember, however, that methadone is a long-acting depressant (36 to 48 hours), whereas the antagonists act for much shorter periods (one to three hours).</span> The patient must, therefore, be monitored continuously for recurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> and may need to be treated repeatedly with the narcotic antagonist. If the diagnosis is correct and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> is due only to overdosage of methadone, the use of other respiratory stimulants is not indicated.</p>
<p>Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or cardiovascular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, the administration of the usual dose of an opioid antagonist may precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of this syndrome will depend on the degree of physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> and the dose of the antagonist administered. If antagonists must be used to treat serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> in the physically dependent patient, the antagonist should be administered with extreme care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Methadone differs from many other opioid agonists in several important ways. Methadone's pharmacokinetic properties, coupled with high interpatient variability in its absorption, metabolism, and relative analgesic potency, necessitate a cautious and highly individualized approach to prescribing. Particular vigilance is necessary during treatment initiation, during conversion from one opioid to another, and during dose titration.</p>
<p>While methadone's duration of analgesic action (typically 4 to 8 hours) in the setting of single-dose studies approximates that of morphine, methadone's plasma elimination half-life is substantially longer than that of morphine (typically 8 to 59 hours vs. 1 to 5 hours). Methadone's peak respiratory depressant effects typically occur later, and persist longer than its peak <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effects</span>. Also, with repeated dosing, methadone may be retained in the liver and then slowly released, prolonging the duration of action despite low plasma concentrations. For these reasons, steady-state plasma concentrations, and full <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effects</span>, are usually not attained until 3 to 5 days of dosing. Additionally, incomplete cross-tolerance between μ-opioid agonists makes determination of dosing during opioid conversion complex.</p>
<p>All of these characteristics make methadone dosing complex and can contribute to cases of iatrogenic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, particularly during treatment initiation and dose titration. <span class="Bold">A high degree of "opioid tolerance" does not eliminate the possibility of methadone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, iatrogenic or otherwise. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Deaths</span> have been reported during conversion to methadone from chronic, high-dose treatment with other opioid agonists.</span></p>

<h2>Treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">Pain</span></h2>
<p class="First">Optimal methadone initiation and dose titration strategies for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> have not been determined. Published equianalgesic conversion ratios between methadone and other opioids are imprecise, providing at best, only population averages that cannot be applied consistently to all patients. It should be noted that many commonly cited equianalgesia tables only present relative analgesic potencies of single opioid doses in non-tolerant patients, thus greatly underestimating methadone's analgesic potency, and its potential for adverse effects in repeated-dose settings. Regardless of the dose determination strategy employed, methadone is most safely initiated and titrated using small initial doses and gradual dose adjustments.</p>
<p>As with all opioid drugs, it is necessary to adjust the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's prior analgesic treatment experience. The following dosing recommendations should only be considered as suggested approaches to what is actually a series of clinical decisions over time in the management of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> of each individual patient. Prescribers should always follow appropriate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> management principles of careful assessment and ongoing monitoring.</p>
<p>In the selection of an initial dose of Methadone Hydrochloride Injection, attention should be given to the following:</p>
<ol class="Arabic">
<li>The total daily dose, potency and specific characteristics of the opioid the patient had been taking previously, if any;</li>
<li>The relative potency estimate used to calculate an equianalgesic starting methadone dose, in particular, whether it is intended for use in acute or chronic methadone dosing;</li>
<li>The patient's degree of opioid tolerance;</li>
<li>The age, general condition and medical status of the patient;</li>
<li>Concurrent medications, particularly other CNS and respiratory depressants;</li>
<li>The type, severity and expected duration of the patient's <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>;</li>
<li>The acceptable balance between <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> control and adverse side effects.</li>
</ol>
<p>Methadone Hydrochloride Injection may be administered intravenously, subcutaneously or intramuscularly. The absorption of subcutaneous and intramuscular methadone has not been well characterized and appears to be unpredictable. Local tissue reactions may occur.</p>
<p>Parenteral products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.</p>

<h2>Initiation of Therapy in Opioid Non-Tolerant Patients</h2>
<p class="First">When parenteral methadone is used as the first analgesic in patients who are not already being treated with, and tolerant to, opioids, the usual intravenous methadone starting dose is 2.5 mg to 10 mg every 8 to 12 hours, slowly titrated to effect. More frequent administration may be required during methadone initiation in order to maintain adequate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, and extreme caution is necessary to avoid overdosage, taking into account methadone's long elimination half life.</p>

<a name="s91"></a><a name="section-13.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Conversion from Oral Methadone to Parenteral Methadone</h2>
<p class="First">Conversion from oral methadone to parenteral methadone should initially use a 2:1 dose ratio (e.g., 10 mg oral methadone to 5 mg parenteral methadone).</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s92"></a><a name="section-13.4"></a><p></p>
<h2>Switching Patients to Parenteral Methadone from other Chronic Opioids</h2>
<p class="First">Switching a patient from another chronically administered opioid to methadone requires caution due to the uncertainty of dose conversion ratios and incomplete cross-tolerance. <span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Deaths</span> have occurred in opioid tolerant patients during conversion to methadone.</span></p>
<p>Conversion ratios in many commonly used equianalgesic dosing tables do not apply in the setting of repeated methadone dosing. Although with single-dose administration the onset and duration of analgesic action, as well as the analgesic potency of methadone and morphine, are similar methadone's potency increases over time with repeated dosing. Furthermore, the conversion ratio between methadone and other opiates varies dramatically depending on baseline opiate (morphine equivalent) use as shown in the table below.</p>
<p>The dose conversion scheme below is derived from various consensus guidelines for converting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436096" conceptname="Chronic pain">chronic pain</span> patients to methadone from morphine. The guidelines used to construct this table, however, were all designed for converting patients from oral morphine to oral methadone. The third column assumes a 2:1 ratio for converting from oral to intravenous methadone. Clinicians should consult published conversion guidelines to determine the equivalent morphine dose for patients converting from other opioids.</p>

<p>Note: Equianalgesic methadone dosing varies not only between patients, but also within the same patient, depending on baseline morphine (or other opioid) dose. <a href="#t1">Tables 1</a> and <a href="#t2">2</a> have been included in order to illustrate this concept and to provide a safe starting point for opioid conversion. Methadone dosing should not be based solely on these tables. Methadone conversion and dose titration methods should always be individualized to account for the patient's prior opioid exposure, general medical condition, concomitant medication, and anticipated breakthrough medication use. The endpoint of titration is achievement of adequate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relief, balanced against tolerability of opioid side effects. If a patient develops intolerable opioid related side effects, the methadone dose, or dosing interval, may need to be decreased.</p>

<h2>Dosage Adjustment During Pregnancy</h2>
<p class="First">Methadone clearance may be increased during pregnancy. Several small studies have demonstrated significantly lower trough methadone plasma concentrations and shorter methadone half-lives in women during their pregnancy compared to after their delivery. During pregnancy a woman's methadone dose may need to be increased, or their dosing interval decreased. Methadone should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<h2>Detoxification and Maintenance Treatment of Opiate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">Dependence</span></h2>
<p class="First">For detoxification and maintenance of opiate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>, methadone should be administered in accordance with the treatment standards cited in 42CFR Section 8.12, including limitations on unsupervised administration. Injectable methadone products are not approved for the outpatient treatment of opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>. Parenteral methadone should be used only for patients who are unable to take oral medication, such as during hospitalization. The patient's oral methadone dose should be converted to an equivalent parenteral dose using the considerations above.</p>
