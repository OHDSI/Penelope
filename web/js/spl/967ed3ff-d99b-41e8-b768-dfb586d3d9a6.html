<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Â Â Â Â LEUKERAN (chlorambucil) was first synthesized by Everett et al. It is a bifunctional alkylating agent of the nitrogen mustard type that has been found active against selected human neoplastic diseases. Chlorambucil is known chemically as 4-[bis(2-chlorethyl)amino]benzenebutanoic acid and has the following structural formula:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="chlorambucil chemical structure" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=967ed3ff-d99b-41e8-b768-dfb586d3d9a6&amp;name=leukeran-1.jpg"></div>
<p>Â Â Â Â Chlorambucil hydrolyzes in water and has a pKa of 5.8.Â <br>Â Â Â Â LEUKERAN (chlorambucil) is available in tablet form for oral administration. Each film-coated tablet contains 2Â mg chlorambucil and the inactive ingredients colloidal silicon dioxide, hypromellose, lactose (anhydrous), macrogol/PEG 400, microcrystalline cellulose, red iron oxide, stearic acid, titanium dioxide, and yellow iron oxide. </p>

<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Chlorambucil, an aromatic nitrogen mustard derivative, is an alkylating agent. Chlorambucil interferes with DNA replication and induces cellular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4048757" conceptname="Apoptosis">apoptosis</span> via the accumulation of cytosolic p53 and subsequent activation of Bax, an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4048757" conceptname="Apoptosis">apoptosis</span> promoter. </p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">In a study of 12 patients given single oral doses of 0.2 mg/kg of LEUKERAN, the mean dose-adjusted (Â±SD) plasma chlorambucil C<span class="Sub">max</span> was 492 Â± 160 ng/mL, the AUC was 883 Â± 329 ng.h/mL, the mean elimination half-life (tÂ½) was 1.3 Â± 0.5 hours, and the T<span class="Sub">max</span> was 0.83 Â± 0.53 hours. For the major metabolite, phenylacetic acid mustard (PAAM), the mean dose-adjusted (Â± SD) plasma C<span class="Sub">max</span> was 306 Â± 73 ng/mL, the AUC was 1204 Â± 285 ng.h/mL, mean tÂ½ was 1.8 Â± 0.4 hours, and the T<span class="Sub">max</span> was 1.9 Â± 0.7 hours.Â <br>Â Â Â Â After single oral doses of 0.6 to 1.2 mg/kg, peak plasma chlorambucil levels (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) are reached within 1 hour and the terminal elimination half-life (t<span class="Sub">Â½</span>) of the parent drug is estimated at 1.5 hours.<br><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Â Â Â Â Absorption: </span></span>Chlorambucil is rapidly and completely (&gt;70%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Consistent with the rapid, predictable absorption of chlorambucil, the inter-individual variability in the plasma pharmacokinetics of chlorambucil has been shown to be relatively small following oral dosages of between 15 and 70 mg (2-fold intra-patient variability, and a 2 to 4 fold interpatient variability in AUC). The absorption of chlorambucil is reduced when taken after food. In a study of ten patients, food intake increased the median T<span class="Sub">max</span> by 2-fold and reduced the dose-adjusted C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values by 55% and 20%, respectively.<br><span class="Bold">Â Â Â Â <span class="Italics">Distribution: </span></span>The apparent volume of distribution averaged 0.31 L/kg following a single 0.2 mg/kg oral dose of chlorambucil in 11 cancer patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4082311" conceptname="B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia">chronic lymphocytic leukemia</span>.Â <br>Â Â Â Â Chlorambucil and its metabolites are extensively bound to plasma and tissue proteins. In vitro, chlorambucil is 99% bound to plasma proteins, specifically albumin. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of chlorambucil have not been determined.Â <br><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Â Â Â Â Metabolism: </span></span>Chlorambucil is extensively metabolized in the liver primarily to phenylacetic acid mustard, which has antineoplastic activity. Chlorambucil and its major metabolite undergo oxidative degradation to monohydroxy and dihydroxy derivatives.Â <br>Â Â Â Â <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Excretion: </span></span>After a single dose of radiolabeled chlorambucil (<span class="Sup">14</span>C), approximately 20% to 60% of the radioactivity appears in the urine after 24 hours. Again, less than 1% of the urinary radioactivity is in the form of chlorambucil or phenylacetic acid mustard. </p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First">Â Â Â Â Because of its carcinogenic properties, chlorambucil should not be given to patients with conditions other than <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4082311" conceptname="B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia">chronic lymphatic leukemia</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">malignant lymphomas</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">Convulsions</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4035976" conceptname="Sterility">infertility</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315497" conceptname="Subacute leukemia">leukemia</span>, and secondary malignancies have been observed when chlorambucil was employed in the therapy of malignant and non-malignant diseases.<br>Â Â Â Â There are many reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138708" conceptname="Acute leukemia">acute leukemia</span> arising in patients with both malignant and non-malignant diseases following chlorambucil treatment. In many instances, these patients also received other chemotherapeutic agents or some form of radiation therapy. The quantitation of the risk of chlorambucil-induction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315497" conceptname="Subacute leukemia">leukemia</span> or carcinoma in humans is not possible. Evaluation of published reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315497" conceptname="Subacute leukemia">leukemia</span> developing in patients who have received chlorambucil (and other alkylating agents) suggests that the risk of leukemogenesis increases with both chronicity of treatment and large cumulative doses. However, it has proved impossible to define a cumulative dose below which there is no risk of the induction of secondary malignancy. The potential benefits from chlorambucil therapy must be weighed on an individual basis against the possible risk of the induction of a secondary malignancy.<br>Â Â Â Â Chlorambucil has been shown to cause chromatid or chromosome damage in humans. Both reversible and permanent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4035976" conceptname="Sterility">sterility</span> have been observed in both sexes receiving chlorambucil.<br>Â Â Â Â A high incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4035976" conceptname="Sterility">sterility</span> has been documented when chlorambucil is administered to prepubertal and pubertal males. Prolonged or permanent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="76744" conceptname="Azoospermia">azoospermia</span> has also been observed in adult males.

<h2>Pregnancy</h2>
<p class="First"> Pregnancy Category D. Chlorambucil can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Unilateral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194152" conceptname="Renal agenesis and dysgenesis">renal agenesis</span> has been observed in 2Â offspring whose mothers received chlorambucil during the first trimester. Urogenital malformations, including absence of a kidney, were found in fetuses of rats given chlorambucil. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant.</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Many patients develop a slowly progressive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441541" conceptname="Lymphocytopenia">lymphopenia</span> during treatment. The lymphocyte count usually rapidly returns to normal levels upon completion of drug therapy. Most patients have some <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span> after the third week of treatment and this may continue for up to 10Â days after the last dose. Subsequently, the neutrophil count usually rapidly returns to normal. Severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span> appears to be related to dosage and usually occurs only in patients who have received a total dosage of 6.5Â mg/kg or more in one course of therapy with continuous dosing. About one quarter of all patients receiving the continuous-dose schedule, and one third of those receiving this dosage in 8Â weeks or less may be expected to develop severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span>.<br>Â Â Â Â While it is not necessary to discontinue chlorambucil at the first evidence of a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> in neutrophil count, it must be remembered that the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> may continue for 10Â days after the last dose, and that as the total dose approaches 6.5Â mg/kg, there is a risk of causing irreversible bone marrow damage. The dose of chlorambucil should be decreased if leukocyte or platelet counts <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> below normal values and should be discontinued for more severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.<br>Â Â Â Â Chlorambucil should <span class="Bold">not</span> be given at full dosages before 4Â weeks after a full course of radiation therapy or chemotherapy because of the vulnerability of the bone marrow to damage under these conditions. If the pretherapy leukocyte or platelet counts are depressed from bone marrow disease process prior to institution of therapy, the treatment should be instituted at a reduced dosage.<br>Â Â Â Â Persistently low neutrophil and platelet counts or peripheral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320074" conceptname="Lymphocytosis">lymphocytosis</span> suggest bone marrow infiltration. If confirmed by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4043761" conceptname="Bone marrow examination">bone marrow examination</span>, the daily dosage of chlorambucil should not exceed 0.1Â mg/kg. Chlorambucil appears to be relatively free from gastrointestinal side effects or other evidence of toxicity apart from the bone marrow depressant action. In humans, single oral doses of 20Â mg or more may produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>.<br>Â Â Â Â Children with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="195314" conceptname="Nephrotic syndrome">nephrotic syndrome</span> and patients receiving high pulse doses of chlorambucil may have an increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>.

<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">Patients must be followed carefully to avoid life-endangering damage to the bone marrow during treatment. Weekly examination of the blood should be made to determine hemoglobin levels, total and differential leukocyte counts, and quantitative platelet counts. Also, during the first 3 to 6Â weeks of therapy, it is recommended that white blood cell counts be made 3 or 4Â days after each of the weekly complete blood counts. Galton et al have suggested that in following patients it is helpful to plot the blood counts on a chart at the same time that body weight, temperature, spleen size, etc., are recorded. It is considered dangerous to allow a patient to go more than 2Â weeks without hematological and clinical examination during treatment.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of chlorambucil did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.<br><span class="Bold">Use in Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal Impairment</span>: </span>The impact of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> on chlorambucil elimination has not been formally studied. The renal elimination of unchanged chlorambucil and its major active metabolites, phenylacetic acid mustard, represents less than 1% of the administered dose. In addition, no dose adjustment was required in 2 dialysis patients on chlorambucil. Therefore, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> is not expected to significantly impact the elimination of chlorambucil. <br><span class="Bold">Use in Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic Impairment</span>: </span>No formal studies have been conducted in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>. As chlorambucil is primarily metabolized in the liver, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> should be closely monitored for toxicity and dose reduction may be considered in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> when treated with LEUKERAN (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Â Â Â Â Reversible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432881" conceptname="Pancytopenia">pancytopenia</span> was the main finding of inadvertent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> of chlorambucil. Neurological toxicity ranging from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitated</span> behavior and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437584" conceptname="Ataxia">ataxia</span> to multiple <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="374924" conceptname="Generalized convulsive epilepsy">grand mal seizures</span> has also occurred. As there is no known antidote, the blood picture should be closely monitored and general supportive measures should be instituted, together with appropriate blood transfusions, if necessary. Chlorambucil is not dialyzable.<br>Â Â Â Â Oral LD<span class="Sub">50</span> single doses in mice are 123Â mg/kg. In rats, a single intraperitoneal dose of 12.5Â mg/kg of chlorambucil produces typical nitrogen-mustard effects; these include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4028206" conceptname="Atrophy">atrophy</span> of the intestinal mucous membrane and lymphoid tissues, severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441541" conceptname="Lymphocytopenia">lymphopenia</span> becoming maximal in 4Â days, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span>. After this dose, the animals begin to recover within 3Â days and appear normal in about a week, although the bone marrow may not become completely normal for about 3Â weeks. An intraperitoneal dose of 18.5Â mg/kg kills about 50% of the rats with development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>. As much as 50Â mg/kg has been given orally to rats as a single dose, with recovery.

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Â Â Â Â The usual oral dosage is 0.1 to 0.2Â mg/kg body weight daily for 3 to 6Â weeks as required. This usually amounts to 4 to 10Â mg per day for the average patient. The entire daily dose may be given at one time. These dosages are for initiation of therapy or for short courses of treatment. The dosage must be carefully adjusted according to the response of the patient and must be reduced as soon as there is an abrupt <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> in the white blood cell count. Patients with Hodgkinâ€™s disease usually require 0.2Â mg/kg daily, whereas patients with other <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphomas</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4082311" conceptname="B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia">chronic lymphocytic leukemia</span> usually require only 0.1Â mg/kg daily. When lymphocytic infiltration of the bone marrow is present, or when the bone marrow is hypoplastic, the daily dose should not exceed 0.1Â mg/kg (about 6Â mg for the average patient).<br>Â Â Â Â Alternate schedules for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4082311" conceptname="B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia">chronic lymphocytic leukemia</span> employing intermittent, biweekly, or once-monthly pulse doses of chlorambucil have been reported. Intermittent schedules of chlorambucil begin with an initial single dose of 0.4Â mg/kg. Doses are generally increased by 0.1Â mg/kg until control of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320074" conceptname="Lymphocytosis">lymphocytosis</span> or toxicity is observed. Subsequent doses are modified to produce mild hematologic toxicity. It is felt that the response rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4082311" conceptname="B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia">chronic lymphocytic leukemia</span> to the biweekly or once-monthly schedule of chlorambucil administration is similar or better to that previously reported with daily administration and that hematologic toxicity was less than or equal to that encountered in studies using daily chlorambucil.<br>Â Â Â Â Radiation and cytotoxic drugs render the bone marrow more vulnerable to damage, and chlorambucil should be used with particular caution within 4Â weeks of a full course of radiation therapy or chemotherapy. However, small doses of palliative radiation over isolated foci remote from the bone marrow will not usually depress the neutrophil and platelet count. In these cases chlorambucil may be given in the customary dosage.<br>Â Â Â Â It is presently felt that short courses of treatment are safer than continuous maintenance therapy, although both methods have been effective. It must be recognized that continuous therapy may give the appearance of â€œmaintenanceâ€? in patients who are actually in remission and have no immediate need for further drug. If maintenance dosage is used, it should not exceed 0.1Â mg/kg daily and may well be as low as 0.03Â mg/kg daily. A typical maintenance dose is 2Â mg to 4Â mg daily, or less, depending on the status of the blood counts. It may, therefore, be desirable to withdraw the drug after maximal control has been achieved, since intermittent therapy reinstituted at time of relapse may be as effective as continuous treatment.<br>Â Â Â Â Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should be used. Several guidelines on this subject have been published.<span class="Sup">1-4</span> There is no general agreement that all of the procedures recommended in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate.</p>
