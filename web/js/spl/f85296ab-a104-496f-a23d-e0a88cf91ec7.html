<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Bromocriptine mesylate is a dopamine receptor agonist, which activates post-synaptic dopamine receptors. The dopaminergic neurons in the tuberoinfundibular process modulate the secretion of prolactin from the anterior pituitary by secreting a prolactin inhibitory factor (thought to be dopamine); in the corpus striatum the dopaminergic neurons are involved in the control of motor function. Clinically, bromocriptine significantly reduces plasma levels of prolactin in patients with physiologically elevated prolactin as well as in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030186" conceptname="Hyperprolactinemia">hyperprolactinemia</span>. The inhibition of physiological lactation as well as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79884" conceptname="Galactorrhea not associated with childbirth">galactorrhea</span> in pathological hyperprolactinemic states is obtained at dose levels that do not affect secretion of other tropic hormones from the anterior pituitary. Experiments have demonstrated that bromocriptine induces long lasting stereotyped behavior in rodents and turning behavior in rats having unilateral lesions in the substantia nigra. These actions, characteristic of those produced by dopamine, are inhibited by dopamine antagonists and suggest a direct action of bromocriptine on striatal dopamine receptors.</p>
<p>Bromocriptine mesylate is a nonhormonal, nonestrogenic agent that inhibits the secretion of prolactin in humans, with little or no effect on other pituitary hormones, except in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4253197" conceptname="Acromegaly">acromegaly</span>, where it lowers elevated blood levels of growth hormone in the majority of patients. In about 75% of cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443800" conceptname="Amenorrhea">amenorrhea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79884" conceptname="Galactorrhea not associated with childbirth">galactorrhea</span>, bromocriptine therapy suppresses the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79884" conceptname="Galactorrhea not associated with childbirth">galactorrhea</span> completely, or almost completely, and reinitiates normal ovulatory menstrual cycles.</p>
<p>Menses are usually reinitiated prior to complete suppression of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79884" conceptname="Galactorrhea not associated with childbirth">galactorrhea</span>; the time for this on average is 6-8 weeks. However, some patients respond within a few days, and others may take up to 8 months.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79884" conceptname="Galactorrhea not associated with childbirth">Galactorrhea</span> may take longer to control depending on the degree of stimulation of the mammary tissue prior to therapy. At least a 75% reduction in secretion is usually observed after 8-12 weeks. Some patients may fail to respond even after 12 months of therapy.</p>
<p>In many acromegalic patients, bromocriptine produces a prompt and sustained reduction in circulating levels of serum growth hormone.</p>
<p>Bromocriptine mesylate produces its therapeutic effect in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, a clinical condition characterized by a progressive deficiency in dopamine synthesis in the substantia nigra, by directly stimulating the dopamine receptors in the corpus striatum. In contrast, levodopa exerts its therapeutic effect only after conversion to dopamine by the neurons of the substantia nigra, which are known to be numerically diminished in this patient population.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics:</span></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics and metabolism of bromocriptine in human subjects were studied with the help of radioactively labeled drug. Twenty-eight percent of an oral dose was absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The blood levels following a 234 mg dose were in the range of 2-3 ng equivalents/mL. Plasma levels were in the range of 4-6 ng equivalents/mL indicating that the red blood cells did not contain appreciable amounts of drug and/or metabolites. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> experiments showed that the drug was 90%-96% bound to serum albumin.</p>
<p>Bromocriptine was completely metabolized prior to excretion. The major route of excretion of absorbed drug was via the bile. Only 2.5%-5.5% of the dose was excreted in the urine. Almost all (84.6%) of the administered dose was excreted in the feces in 120 hours.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030186" conceptname="Hyperprolactinemia">Hyperprolactinemia</span>-Associated Dysfunctions:</span></p>
<p>Bromocriptine mesylate tablets and capsules are indicated for the treatment of dysfunctions associated with <span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030186" conceptname="Hyperprolactinemia">hyperprolactinemia</span></span> including <span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443800" conceptname="Amenorrhea">amenorrhea</span></span> with or without <span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79884" conceptname="Galactorrhea not associated with childbirth">galactorrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4035976" conceptname="Sterility">infertility</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4167354" conceptname="Hypogonadism">hypogonadism</span>.</span> Bromocriptine treatment is indicated in patients with <span class="Bold">prolactinsecreting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span>,</span> which may be the basic underlying endocrinopathy contributing to the above clinical presentations. <span class="Bold">Reduction</span> in <span class="Bold">tumor size</span> has been demonstrated in both male and female patients with macroadenomas. In cases where adenectomy is elected, a course of bromocriptine mesylate tablets and/or capsules therapy may be used to reduce the tumor <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> prior to surgery.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4253197" conceptname="Acromegaly">Acromegaly</span>:</span></p>
<p>Bromocriptine mesylate tablets and capsules therapy is indicated in the treatment of</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4253197" conceptname="Acromegaly">acromegaly</span>. Bromocriptine therapy, alone or as adjunctive therapy with pituitary irradiation or</p>
<p>surgery, reduces serum growth hormone by 50% or more in approximately 34 of patients treated, although not usually to normal levels.</p>
<p>Since the effects of external pituitary radiation may not become maximal for several years, adjunctive therapy with bromocriptine offers potential benefit before the effects of irradiation are manifested.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Parkinson's Disease:</span></p>
<p>Bromocriptine mesylate tablets or capsules are indicated in the treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic or postencephalitic Parkinson's disease. As adjunctive treatment to levodopa (alone or with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor), bromocriptine therapy may provide additional therapeutic benefits in those patients who are currently maintained on optimal dosages of levodopa, those who are beginning to deteriorate (develop tolerance) to levodopa therapy, and those who are experiencing â€œend of dose failureâ€? on levodopa therapy. Bromocriptine therapy may permit a reduction of the maintenance dose of levodopa and, thus may ameliorate the occurrence and/or severity of adverse reactions associated with long-term levodopa therapy such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4319906" conceptname="Dyskinesia">abnormal involuntary movements</span> (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047115" conceptname="Oral dyskinesia">dyskinesias</span>) and the marked swings in motor function (â€œon-offâ€? phenomenon). Continued efficacy of bromocriptine therapy during treatment of more than 2 years has not been established.</p>
<p>Data are insufficient to evaluate potential benefit from treating newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease with bromocriptine. Studies have shown, however, significantly more adverse reactions (notably <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>) in bromocriptinetreated patients than in levodopa/carbidopa treated patients. Patients unresponsive to levodopa are poor candidates for bromocriptine therapy.</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Safety and efficacy of bromocriptine have not been established in patients with renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span>. Care should be exercised when administering bromocriptine mesylate therapy concomitantly with other medications known to lower blood pressure.</p>
<p>The drug should be used with caution in patients with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychosis</span> or cardiovascular disease. If acromegalic patients or patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4144527" conceptname="Prolactinoma">prolactinoma</span> or Parkinson's disease are being treated with bromocriptine during pregnancy, they should be cautiously observed, particularly during the post-partum period if they have a history of cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Hyperprolactinemic States:</span></p>
<p>Visual field impairment is a known complication of macroprolactinoma. Effective treatment with bromocriptine leads to a reduction in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030186" conceptname="Hyperprolactinemia">hyperprolactinemia</span> and often to a resolution of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373786" conceptname="Abnormal vision">visual impairment</span>. In some patients, however, a secondary deterioration of visual fields may subsequently develop despite normalized prolactin levels and tumor shrinkage, which may</p>
<p>result from traction on the optic chiasm which is pulled down into the now partially empty sella. In these cases the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377286" conceptname="Visual field defect">visual field defect</span> may improve on reduction of bromocriptine dosage while there is some elevation of prolactin and some tumor re-expansion. Monitoring of visual fields in patients with macroprolactinoma is therefore recommended for an early recognition of secondary field loss due to chiasmal herniation and adaptation of drug dosage.</p>
<p>The relative efficacy of bromocriptine versus surgery in preserving visual fields is not known. Patients with rapidly progressive visual field loss should be evaluated by a neurosurgeon to help decide on the most appropriate therapy.</p>
<p>Since pregnancy is often the therapeutic objective in many hyperprolactinemic patients presenting with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443800" conceptname="Amenorrhea">amenorrhea</span>/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79884" conceptname="Galactorrhea not associated with childbirth">galactorrhea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4167354" conceptname="Hypogonadism">hypogonadism</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4035976" conceptname="Sterility">infertility</span>), a careful assessment of the pituitary is essential to detect the presence of a prolactin-secreting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenoma</span>. Patients not seeking pregnancy, or those harboring large <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span>, should be advised to use contraceptive measures, other than oral contraceptives, during treatment with bromocriptine. Since pregnancy may occur prior to reinitiation of menses, a pregnancy test is recommended at least every 4 weeks during the amenorrheic period, and, once menses are reinitiated, every time a patient misses a menstrual period. Treatment with bromocriptine mesylate tablets or capsules should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy has been established. Patients must be monitored closely throughout pregnancy for signs and symptoms that may signal the enlargement of a previously undetected or existing prolactinsecreting tumor. Discontinuation of bromocriptine treatment in patients with known macroadenomas has been associated with rapid regrowth of tumor and increase in serum prolactin in most cases.</p>

<p>Possible tumor expansion while receiving bromocriptine therapy has been reported in a few patients.

In post-marketing reports, bromocriptine has been associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, and episodes of sudden sleep onset, particularly in patients with Parkinson's disease. Sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness or warning signs, has been reported very rarely. All patients receiving bromocriptine should be cautioned with regard to engaging in activities requiring rapid and precise responses, such as driving an automobile or operating machinery.</p>
<p>Patients receiving bromocriptine for hyperprolactinemic states associated with macroadenoma or those who have had previous transsphenoidal surgery, should be told to report any persistent watery <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4170297" conceptname="Sniffles">nasal discharge</span> to their physician. Patients receiving bromocriptine for treatment of a macroadenoma should be told that discontinuation of drug may be associated with rapid regrowth of the tumor and recurrence of their original symptoms.

<h2>Drug Interactions:</h2>
<p class="First">The risk of using bromocriptine in combination with other drugs has not been systematically evaluated, but alcohol may potentiate the side effects of bromocriptine. Bromocriptine may interact with dopamine antagonists, butyrophenones, and certain other agents. Compounds in these categories result in a decreased efficacy of bromocriptine: phenothiazines, haloperidol, metoclopramide, pimozide. Concomitant use of bromocriptine with other ergot alkaloids is not recommended.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:</span></p>
<p>A 74-week study was conducted in mice using dietary levels of bromocriptine mesylate equivalent to oral doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg/day. A 100-week study in rats was conducted using dietary levels equivalent to oral doses of 1.7, 9.8, and 44 mg/kg/day. The highest doses tested in mice and rats were approximately 2.5 and 4.4 times, respectively, the maximum human dose administered in controlled clinical trials (100 mg/day) based on body surface area. Malignant uterine tumors, endometrial and myometrial, were found in rats as follows: 0/50 control females, 2/50 females given 1.7 mg/kg daily, 7/49 females given 9.8 mg/kg daily, and 9/50 females given 44 mg/kg daily. The occurrence of these neoplasms is probably attributable to the high estrogen/progesterone ratio which occurs in rats as a result of the prolactin-inhibiting action of bromocriptine mesylate. The endocrine mechanisms believed to be involved in the rats are not present in humans. There is no known correlation between uterine malignancies occurring in bromocriptine-treated rats and human risk. In contrast to the findings in rats, the uteri from mice killed after 74 weeks treatment did not exhibit evidence of drug-related changes.</p>
<p>Bromocriptine mesylate was evaluated for mutagenic potential in the battery of tests that included Ames bacterial mutation assay, mutagenic activity <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> on V79 Chinese hamster fibroblasts, cytogenetic analysis of Chinese hamster bone marrow cells following <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> treatment, and an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> micronucleus test for mutagenic potential in mice.</p>
<p>No mutagenic effects were obtained in any of these tests.</p>
<p>Fertility and reproductive performance in female rats were not influenced adversely by treatment with bromocriptine beyond the predicted decrease in the weight of pups due to suppression of lactation. In males treated with 50 mg/kg of this drug, mating and fertility were within the normal range. Increased perinatal loss was produced in the subgroups of dams, sacrificed on day 21 post-partum (p.p.) after mating with males treated with the highest dose (50 mg/kg).</p>

<p>Administration of 10-30 mg/kg of bromocriptine to 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of rats on days 6-15 post coitum (p.c.) as well as a single dose of 10 mg/kg on day 5 p.c. interfered with nidation. Three mg/kg given on days 6-15 were without effect on nidation, and did not produce any anomalies. In animals treated from day 8-15 p.c., i.e., after implantation, 30 mg/kg produced increased prenatal mortality in the form of increased incidence of embryonic resorption. One anomaly, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4166825" conceptname="Aplasia">aplasia</span> of spinal vertebrae and ribs, was found in the group of 262 fetuses derived from the dams treated with 30 mg/kg bromocriptine. No fetotoxic effects were found in offspring of dams treated during the peri- or post-natal period.</p>
<p>Two studies were conducted in rabbits (2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span>) to determine the potential to interfere with nidation. Dose levels of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day from day 1 to day 6 p.c. did not adversely affect nidation. The high dose was approximately 63 times the maximum human dose administered in controlled clinical trials (100 mg/day), based on body surface area. In New Zealand white rabbits some embryo mortality occurred at 300 mg/kg which was a reflection of overt maternal toxicity. Three studies were conducted in 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of rabbits to determine the teratological potential of bromocriptine at dose levels of 3, 10, 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg given from day 6 to day 18 p.c. In 2 studies with the Yellow-silver <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135923" conceptname="Cleft palate">cleft palate</span> was found in 3 and 2 fetuses at maternally toxic doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg, respectively. One control fetus also exhibited this anomaly. In the third study conducted with New Zealand white rabbits using an identical protocol, no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135923" conceptname="Cleft palate">cleft palates</span> were produced.</p>
<p>No teratological or embryo-toxic effects of bromocriptine were produced in any of 6 offspring from 6 monkeys at a dose level of 2 mg/kg.</p>
<p>Information concerning 1276 pregnancies in women taking bromocriptine has been collected. In the majority of cases, bromocriptine was discontinued within 8 weeks into pregnancy (mean 28.7 days), however, 8 patients received the drug continuously throughout pregnancy. The mean daily dose for all patients was 5.8 mg (range 1-40 mg).</p>
<p>Of these 1276 pregnancies, there were 1088 full term deliveries (4 stillborn), 145 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4067106" conceptname="Miscarriage">spontaneous abortions</span> (11.4%), and 28 induced abortions (2.2%). Moreover, 12 extrauterine gravidities and 3 hydatidiform moles (twice in the same patient) caused early termination of pregnancy. These data compare favorably with the abortion rate (1 1%-25%) cited for pregnancies induced by clomiphene citrate, menopausal gonadotropin, and chorionic gonadotropin.</p>
<p>Although <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4067106" conceptname="Miscarriage">spontaneous abortions</span> often go unreported, especially prior to 20 weeks of gestation, their frequency has been estimated to be 15%.</p>
<p>The incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span> in the population at large ranges from 2%-4.5%. The incidence in 1109 live births from patients receiving bromocriptine is 3.3%.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies for bromocriptine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether the elderly respond differently from younger subjects. However, other reported clinical experiences, including post-marketing reporting of adverse events, have not identified differences in response or tolerability between elderly and younger patients. Even though no variation in efficacy or adverse reaction profile in geriatric patients taking bromocriptine has been observed, greater sensitivity of some elderly individuals cannot be categorically ruled out. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, starting at the lower end of the dose range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in this population.</p>

<h2>Adverse Events Observed in Other Conditions:</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Post-partum Patients:</span></span></p>
<p>In post-partum studies with bromocriptine 23 percent of post-partum patients treated had at least 1 side effect, but they were generally mild to moderate in degree. Therapy was discontinued in approximately 3% of patients. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions were: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> (10%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span> (8%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> (7%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> (3%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span> (1.0%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">syncope</span> (0.7%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span> (0.4%) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75635" conceptname="Cramp">cramps</span> (0.4%). Decreases in blood pressure (3 20 mm Hg systolic and 3 10 mm Hg diastolic) occurred in 28% of patients at least once during the first 3 postpartum days; these were usually of a transient nature. Reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">fainting</span> in the puerperium may possibly be related to this effect. In post-marketing experience in the U.S. serious adverse reactions reported include 72 cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> (including 4 cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span>), 30 cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, and 9 cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> among post-partum patients. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">Seizure</span> cases were not necessarily accompanied by the development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>.

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">General:</span></p>
<p>It is recommended that bromocriptine mesylate tablets and capsules be taken with food. Patients should be evaluated frequently during dose escalation to determine the lowest dosage that produces a therapeutic response.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Hyperprolactinemic Indications:</span></p>
<p>The initial dosage of bromocriptine mesylate tablets in adults is 34 to one 234 mg scored tablet daily. An additional 234 mg tablet may be added to the treatment regimen as tolerated every 2-7 days until an optimal therapeutic response is achieved. The therapeutic dosage ranged from 2.5-15 mg daily in adults studied clinically.</p>
<p>Based on limited data in children of age 11 to 15, (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_pediatric_use_id_5e5eac1f-feb5-479b-a7dc-c98c237dbc8c">Pediatric Use</a></span>subsection) the initial dose is 34 to one 234 mg scored tablet daily. Dosing may need to be increased as tolerated until a therapeutic response is achieved. The therapeutic dosage ranged from 2.5-10 mg daily in children with prolactin-secreting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437251" conceptname="Benign neoplasm of pituitary gland and craniopharyngeal duct">pituitary adenomas</span>.</p>
<p>In order to reduce the likelihood of prolonged exposure to bromocriptine mesylate tablets or capsules should an unsuspected pregnancy occur, a mechanical contraceptive should be used in conjunction with bromocriptine therapy until normal ovulatory menstrual cycles have been restored. Contraception may then be discontinued in patients desiring pregnancy.</p>
<p>Thereafter, if menstruation does not occur within 3 days of the expected date, bromocriptine therapy should be discontinued and a pregnancy test performed.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4253197" conceptname="Acromegaly">Acromegaly</span>:</span></p>
<p>Virtually all acromegalic patients receiving therapeutic benefit from bromocriptine mesylate tablets and capsules also have reductions in circulating levels of growth hormone. Therefore, periodic assessment of circulating levels of growth hormone will, in most cases, serve as a guide in determining the therapeutic potential of bromocriptine. If, after a brief trial with bromocriptine therapy, no significant reduction in growth hormone levels has taken place, careful assessment of the clinical features of the disease should be made, and if no change has occurred, dosage adjustment or discontinuation of therapy should be considered.</p>
<p>The initial recommended dosage is 34 to one 234 mg bromocriptine mesylate tablet on retiring (with food) for 3 days. An additional 34 to 1 bromocriptine mesylate tablet should be added to the treatment regimen as tolerated every 3-7 days until the patient obtains optimal therapeutic benefit. Patients should be reevaluated monthly and the dosage adjusted based on reductions of growth hormone or clinical response. The usual optimal therapeutic dosage range of bromocriptine mesylate tablets and capsules varies from 20-30 mg/day in most patients. The maximal dosage should not exceed 100 mg/day.</p>
<p>Patients treated with pituitary irradiation should be withdrawn from bromocriptine therapy on a yearly basis to assess both the clinical effects of radiation on the disease process as well as the effects of bromocriptine therapy. Usually a 4-8 week withdrawal period is adequate for this purpose. Recurrence of the signs/symptoms or increases in growth hormone indicate the disease process is still active and further courses of bromocriptine should be considered.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Parkinson's Disease:</span></p>
<p>The basic principle of bromocriptine mesylate therapy is to initiate treatment at a low dosage and, on an individual basis, increase the daily dosage slowly until a maximum therapeutic response is achieved. The dosage of levodopa during this introductory period should be maintained, if possible. The initial dose of bromocriptine is 34 of a 234 mg tablet twice daily with meals. Assessments are advised at 2-week intervals during dosage titration to ensure that the lowest dosage producing an optimal therapeutic response is not exceeded. If necessary, the dosage may be increased every 14-28 days by 234 mg/day with meals. Should it be advisable to reduce the dosage of levodopa because of adverse reactions, the daily dosage of bromocriptine, if increased, should be accomplished gradually in small (234 mg) increments. The safety of bromocriptine mesylate tablets and capsules has not been demonstrated in dosages exceeding 100 mg/day.</p>
