<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">The efficacy of paroxetine in the treatment of MDD, OCD, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> (PD), and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434613" conceptname="Generalized anxiety disorder">generalized anxiety disorder</span> (GAD) is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system resulting from inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-hydroxy-tryptamine, 5-HT). Studies at clinically relevant doses in humans have demonstrated that paroxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. 
                        <span class="Italics">In vitro</span>

                        studies in animals also suggest that paroxetine is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake. 
                        <span class="Italics">In vitro</span>

                        radioligand binding studies indicate that paroxetine has little affinity for muscarinic alpha1-, alpha2-, beta-adrenergic-, dopamine (D2)-, 5-HT1-, 5-HT2-, and histamine (H1)-receptors; antagonism of muscarinic, histaminergic, and alpha1-adrenergic receptors has been associated with various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular effects for other psychotropic drugs.</p>
<p>Because the relative potencies of paroxetine's major metabolites are at most 1/50 of the parent compound, they are essentially inactive.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Paroxetine mesylate is completely absorbed after oral dosing of the mesylate salt. In a study in which normal male subjects (n=25) received paroxetine 30 mg tablets daily for 24 days, steady-state paroxetine concentrations were achieved by approximately 13 days for most subjects, although it may take substantially longer in an occasional patient. At steady state, mean values of C<span class="Sub">max</span>, T<span class="Sub">max</span>, C<span class="Sub">min</span>, and T<span class="Sub">1/2 </span>were 81.3 ng/ml (CV 41%), 8.1 hr. (CV 56%), 43.2 ng/ml (CV 52%), and 33.2 hr. (CV 52%), respectively. The steady-state C<span class="Sub">max</span> and C<span class="Sub">min</span> values were about 7 and 10 times what would be predicted from single dose studies. Steady-state drug exposure based on AUC<span class="Sub">0-24</span> was about 10 times greater than would have been predicted from single-dose data in these subjects. The excess accumulation is a consequence of the fact that one of the enzymes that metabolizes paroxetine is readily saturable.</p>
<p>In steady-state dose proportionality studies involving elderly and nonelderly patients, at doses of 20 to 40 mg daily for the elderly and 20 to 50 mg daily for the nonelderly, some nonlinearity was observed in both populations, again reflecting a saturable metabolic pathway. In comparison to C<span class="Sub">min</span> values after 20 mg daily, values after 40 mg were only about 2 to 3 times greater than doubled.</p>
<p>The effects of food on the bioavailability of paroxetine were studied in subjects administered a single dose with and without food. AUC was only slightly increased (6%) when drug was administered with food but the C<span class="Sub">max</span> was 29% greater, while the time to reach peak plasma concentration decreased from 6.4 hours post-dosing to 4.9 hours.</p>
<p>Paroxetine is extensively metabolized after oral administration. The principal metabolites are polar and conjugated products of oxidation and methylation, which are readily cleared. Conjugates with glucuronic acid and sulfate predominate, and major metabolites have been isolated and identified. Data indicate that the metabolites have no more than 1/50 the potency of the parent compound at inhibiting serotonin uptake. The metabolism of paroxetine is accomplished in part by cytochrome CYP2D6. Saturation of this enzyme at clinical doses appears to account for the nonlinearity of paroxetine kinetics with increasing dose and increasing duration of treatment. The role of this enzyme in paroxetine metabolism also suggests potential drug-drug interactions (see 
                        <a href="#s35">PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>
<p>Approximately 64% of a 30 mg oral solution dose of paroxetine was excreted in the urine with 2% as the parent compound and 62% as metabolites over a 10-day post-dosing period. About 36% was excreted in the feces (probably via the bile), mostly as metabolites and less than 1% as the parent compound over the 10-day post-dosing period.</p>
<p>In a meta analysis of paroxetine from 4 studies done in healthy volunteers following multiple dosing of 20 mg/day to 40 mg/day, males did not exhibit a significantly lower C<span class="Sub">max</span> or AUC than females.</p>

<p class="First">The efficacy of paroxetine as a treatment for MDD has been established in 6 placebo-controlled studies of patients with MDD (ages 18 to 73). In these studies paroxetine was shown to be significantly more effective than placebo in treating MDD by at least 2 of the following measures: Hamilton <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> Rating Scale (HDRS), the Hamilton <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="40546087" conceptname="Depressed mood">depressed mood</span> item, and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-Severity of Illness. Paroxetine was significantly better than placebo in improvement of the HDRS sub-factor scores, including the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="40546087" conceptname="Depressed mood">depressed mood</span> item, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435524" conceptname="Sleep disorder">sleep disturbance</span> factor, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> factor.</p>
<p>A study of outpatients with MDD who had responded to paroxetine (HDRS total score &lt;8) during an initial 8-week open treatment phase and were then randomized to continuation on paroxetine or placebo for 1 year demonstrated a significantly lower relapse rate for patients taking paroxetine (15%) compared to those on placebo (39%).

<p class="First">The effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment OCD was demonstrated in two 12-week multicenter placebo-controlled studies of adult outpatients (Studies 1 and 2). Patients in all studies had moderate to severe OCD (DSM-IIIR) with mean baseline ratings on the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) total score ranging from 23 to 26. Study 1, a dose-range finding study where patients were treated with fixed doses of 20, 40, or 60 mg of paroxetine/day demonstrated that daily doses of paroxetine 40 and 60 mg are effective in the treatment of OCD. Patients receiving doses of 40 and 60 mg paroxetine experienced a mean reduction of approximately 6 and 7 points, respectively, on the YBOCS total score which was significantly greater than the approximate 4-point reduction at 20 mg and a 3-point reduction in the placebo-treated patients. Study 2 was a flexible dose study comparing paroxetine (20 to 60 mg daily) with clomipramine (25 to 250 mg daily). In this study, patients receiving paroxetine experienced a mean reduction of approximately 7 points on the YBOCS total score, which was significantly greater than the mean reduction of approximately 4 points in the placebo-treated patients.</p>

Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as an increase of ≥2 points compared to baseline on the CGI-Severity of Illness scale to a score of ≥4, or withdrawal due to lack of efficacy. Patients receiving continued paroxetine experienced a significantly lower relapse rate over the subsequent 24 weeks compared to those receiving placebo.</p>

There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behaviour (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18-24) with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.</p>

The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in

                              Epidemiological studies have shown that infants exposed to paroxetine in the first trimester of pregnancy have an increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly cardiovascular malformations. The findings from these studies are summarized below:</p>
<ul class="Square">
<li>A study based on Swedish national registry data demonstrated that infants exposed to paroxetine during pregnancy (n = 815) had an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations (2% risk in paroxetine-exposed infants) compared to the entire registry population (1% risk), for an odds ratio (OR) of 1.8 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.8). No increase in the risk of overall congenital malformations was seen in the paroxetine-exposed infants. The cardiac malformations in the paroxetine-exposed infants were primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434462" conceptname="Ventricular septal defect">ventricular septal defects</span> (VSDs) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4289309" conceptname="Atrial septal defect">atrial septal defects</span> (ASDs). Septal defects range in severity from those that resolve spontaneously to those which require surgery.</li>
<li>A separate retrospective cohort study from the United States (United Healthcare data) evaluated 5,956 infants of mothers dispensed antidepressants during the first trimester (n = 815 for paroxetine). This study showed a trend towards an increased risk for cardiovascular malformations for paroxetine (risk of 1.5%) compared to other antidepressants (risk of 1%), for an OR of 1.5 (95% confidence interval 0.8 to 2.9). Of the 12 paroxetine-exposed infants with cardiovascular malformations, 9 had VSDs. This study also suggested an increased risk of overall major congenital malformations including cardiovascular defects for paroxetine (4% risk) compared to other (2% risk) antidepressants (OR 1.8; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.8).</li>
<li>Two large case-control studies using separate databases, each with &gt;9,000 birth defect cases and &gt;4,000 controls, found that maternal use of paroxetine during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of right ventricular outflow tract obstructions. In one study the OR was 2.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 6.0, 7 exposed infants) and in the other study the OR was 3.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 8.8, 6 exposed infants).</li>
<li>Other studies have found varying results as to whether there was an increased risk of overall, cardiovascular, or specific congenital malformations. A meta-analysis of epidemiological data over a 16-year period (1992 to 2008) included a total of 20 distinct studies: 11 studies (including the above noted studies) reported estimates for both cardiovascular defects and overall congenital malformations, 3 studies reported estimates only for cardiovascular defects, and 6 studies reported estimates only for overall congenital malformations. While subject to limitations, this meta-analysis suggested an increased occurrence of cardiovascular malformations (prevalence odds ratio [POR] 1.5; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.9) and overall malformations (POR 1.2; 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 1.4) with paroxetine use during the first trimester. It was not possible in this meta-analysis to determine the extent to which cardiovascular malformations might have contributed to overall malformations, nor was it possible to determine whether any specific types of cardiovascular malformations contributed to all cardiovascular malformations.</li>
<li>If a patient becomes pregnant while taking paroxetine, she should be advised of the potential harm to the fetus. Unless the benefits of paroxetine to the mother justify continuing treatment, consideration should be given to either discontinuing paroxetine therapy or switching to another antidepressant (see 
                                 <a href="#s39">PRECAUTIONS—Discontinuation of Treatment With PEXEVA®</a>). For women who intend to become pregnant or are in their first trimester of pregnancy, paroxetine should only be initiated after consideration of the other available treatment options.</li>

                              PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate): Recent clinical trials supporting the various approved indications for paroxetine employed a taper-phase regimen, rather than an abrupt discontinuation of treatment. The taper-phase regimen used in GAD and PTSD clinical trials involved an incremental decrease in the daily dose by 10 mg/day at weekly intervals. When a daily dose of 20 mg/day was reached, patients were continued on this dose for 1 week before treatment was stopped.</p>
<p>With this regimen in those studies, the following adverse events were reported at an incidence of 2% or greater for paroxetine at an incidence at least twice that reported for placebo: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4304251" conceptname="Bizarre dreams">abnormal dreams</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4193492" conceptname="Acroparesthesia">paresthesia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>.

<p>During marketing of paroxetine and other SSRIs and SNRIs (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon the discontinuation of these drugs (particularly when abrupt), including the following: dysphoric mood, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4311114" conceptname="Sensory disorder">sensory disturbances</span> (eg, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4193492" conceptname="Acroparesthesia">paresthesias</span> such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4193492" conceptname="Acroparesthesia">electric shock sensations</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377575" conceptname="Tinnitus">tinnitus</span>), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4061577" conceptname="Lethargy">lethargy</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4078201" conceptname="Mood swings">emotional lability</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333678" conceptname="Hypomania">hypomania</span>.

<p>Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with paroxetine. A gradual reduction in the dose, rather than abrupt cessation, is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate (see

                              Some studies have shown that the efficacy of tamoxifen, as measured by the risk of breast cancer relapse/mortality, may be reduced when co-prescribed with paroxetine as a result of paroxetine’s irreversible inhibition of CYP2D6 (see <a href="#s55">Drug Interactions</a>). However, other studies have failed to demonstrate such a risk. It is uncertain whether the co-administration of paroxetine and tamoxifen has a significant adverse effect on the efficacy of tamoxifen.

<p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome CYP2D6:</span>

                              Many drugs, including most drugs effective in the treatment of MDD (paroxetine, other SSRIs, and many tricyclics), are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP2D6. Like other agents that are metabolized by CYP2D6, paroxetine may significantly inhibit the activity of this isozyme. In most patients (&gt;90%), this CYP2D6 isozyme is saturated early during paroxetine dosing. In one study, daily dosing of paroxetine (20 mg qd) under steady-state conditions increased single dose desipramine (100 mg) C<span class="Sub">max</span>, AUC, and T<span class="Sub">1/2</span> by an average of approximately 2-, 5-, and 3-fold, respectively. Concomitant use of paroxetine with risperidone, a CYP2D6 substrate, has also been evaluated. In one study, daily dosing of paroxetine 20 mg in patients stabilized on risperidone (4 to 8 mg/day) increased mean plasma concentrations of risperidone approximately 4-fold, decreased 9-hydroxyrisperidone concentrations approximately 10%, and increased concentrations of the active moiety (the sum of risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone) approximately 1.4-fold. The effect of paroxetine on the pharmacokinetics of atomoxetine has been evaluated when both drugs were at steady state. In healthy volunteers who were extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6, paroxetine 20 mg daily was given in combination with 20 mg atomoxetine every 12 hours. This resulted in increases in steady state atomoxetine AUC values that were 6- to 8-fold greater and in atomoxetine C<span class="Sub">max</span> values that were 3- to 4-fold greater than when atomoxetine was given alone. Dosage adjustment of atomoxetine may be necessary and it is recommended that atomoxetine be initiated at a reduced dose when it is given with paroxetine.</p>
<p>Concomitant use of paroxetine with other drugs metabolized by cytochrome CYP2D6 has not been formally studied but may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either paroxetine or the other drug.</p>
<p>Therefore, coadministration of PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate) with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including certain drugs effective in the treatment of MDD (eg, nortriptyline, amitriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, and fluoxetine), phenothiazines, risperidone, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (eg, propafenone, flecainide, and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (eg, quinidine), should be approached with caution.</p>
<p>However, due to the risk of serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4132309" conceptname="Sudden death">sudden death</span> potentially associated with elevated plasma levels of thioridazine, paroxetine, and thioridazine should not be coadministered (see <a href="#s23">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a> and <a href="#s24">WARNINGS</a>).</p>
<p>Tamoxifen is a pro-drug requiring metabolic activation by CYP2D6.  Inhibition of CYP2D6 by paroxetine may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of an active metabolite (endoxifen) and hence reduced efficacy of tamoxifen (see <a href="#s35">PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>
<p>At steady state, when the CYP2D6 pathway is essentially saturated, paroxetine clearance is governed by alternative P450 isozymes, which, unlike CYP2D6, show no evidence of saturation (see 
                              <a href="#s69">PRECAUTIONS—Tricyclic Antidepressants</a>).</p>

In addition, in vitro studies have shown ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity, to be at least 100 times more potent than paroxetine as an inhibitor of the metabolism of several substrates for this enzyme, including terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, triazolam, and cyclosporine. Based on the assumption that the relationship between paroxetine's in vitro K<span class="Sub">i</span> and its lack of effect on terfenadine's in vivo clearance predicts its effect on other 3A4 substrates, paroxetine's extent of inhibition of CYP3A4 activity is not likely to be of clinical significance.</p>

<h2>Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials</h2>
<p class="First">The prescriber should be aware that the figures in the tables following cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side effect incidence rate in the populations studied.</p>

                              Although changes in sexual desire, sexual performance, and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder, they may also be a consequence of pharmacologic treatment. In particular, some evidence suggests that SSRIs can cause such untoward sexual experiences.</p>
<p>Reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance, and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, however, in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in product labeling are likely to underestimate their actual incidence.</p>

<h2>Other Events Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Paroxetine</h2>
<p class="First">During its premarketing assessment in MDD, multiple doses of paroxetine were administered to 6145 patients in phase 2 and 3 studies. The conditions and duration of exposure to paroxetine varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) open and double-blind studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, and fixed-dose and titration studies. During premarketing clinical trials in OCD, PD, and GAD, 542, 469, and 735 patients, respectively, received multiple doses of paroxetine. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories.</p>
<p>In the tabulations that follow, reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based Dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 9089 patients exposed to multiple doses of paroxetine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving paroxetine. All reported events are included except those already listed in 
                        <a href="#t2">Tables 2</a>

                        to 
                        <a href="#t4">4</a>

                        , those reported in terms so general as to be uninformative, and those events where a drug cause was remote.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that although the events reported occurred during treatment with paroxetine, they were not necessarily caused by it.</p>
<p>Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled trials appear in this listing); infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients. Events of major clinical importance are also described in the PRECAUTIONS section.</p>

While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency for any drug-seeking behavior, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed. Consequently, patients should be evaluated carefully for history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed closely for signs of PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate) misuse or abuse (eg, development of tolerance, incrementations of dose, drug-seeking behavior).</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Human Experience:</span>

                        Since the introduction of paroxetine in the US, 342 spontaneous cases of deliberate or accidental overdosage during paroxetine treatment have been reported worldwide (circa 1999). These include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> with paroxetine alone and in combination with other substances. Of these, 48 cases were fatal and, of the fatalities, 17 appeared to involve paroxetine alone. Eight fatal cases which documented the amount of paroxetine ingested were generally confounded by the ingestion of other drugs or alcohol or the presence of significant comorbid conditions. Of 145 non-fatal cases with known outcome, most recovered without sequelae. The largest known ingestion involved 2000 mg of paroxetine (33 times the maximum recommended daily dose) in a patient who recovered.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Overdosage Management:</span>

                        No specific antidotes for paroxetine are known. Treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any drugs effective in the treatment of MDD.</p>
<p>Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. General supportive and symptomatic measures are also recommended. Induction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> is not recommended.</p>
<p>Due to the large volume of distribution of this drug, forced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span>, dialysis, hemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit.</p>
<p>A specific caution involves patients who are taking or have recently taken paroxetine who might ingest excessive quantities of a tricyclic antidepressant. In such a case, accumulation of the parent tricyclic and/or an active metabolite may increase the possibility of clinically significant sequelae and extend the time needed for close medical observation (see 
                        <a href="#s67">Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome CYP2D6 under PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>
<p>In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement. The physician should consider contacting a poison control center for additional information on the treatment of any <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. Telephone numbers for certified poison control centers are listed in the

It is generally agreed that acute episodes of MDD require several months or longer of sustained pharmacologic therapy. Whether the dose needed to induce remission is identical to the dose needed to maintain and/or sustain euthymia is unknown.</p>
<p>Systematic evaluation of the efficacy of paroxetine has shown that efficacy is maintained for periods of up to 1 year with doses that averaged about 30 mg.</p>
