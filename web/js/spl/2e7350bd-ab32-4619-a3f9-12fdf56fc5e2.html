<p><span class="Bold"> Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of PARNATE or any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. PARNATE is not approved for use in pediatric patients.

<h1>ACTION</h1>
<p class="First"> Tranylcypromine is a non-hydrazine monoamine oxidase inhibitor with a rapid onset of activity. It increases the concentration of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and serotonin in storage sites throughout the nervous system and, in theory, this increased concentration of monoamines in the brain stem is the basis for its antidepressant activity. When tranylcypromine is withdrawn, monoamine oxidase activity is recovered in 3 to 5 days, although the drug is excreted in 24 hours.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">4.   </span><span class="Bold">In</span><span class="Bold"> combination with bupropion</span></p>
<p> The concurrent administration of an MAO inhibitor and bupropion hydrochloride (Wellbutrin<span class="Sup">®</span>, Wellbutrin SR<span class="Sup">®</span>, Wellbutrin XL<span class="Sup">®</span>,  Zyban<span class="Sup">®</span>, GlaxoSmithKline) is contraindicated.

<p><span class="Bold">5.   </span><span class="Bold">In</span><span class="Bold"> combination with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)</span></p>
<p> As a general rule, PARNATE should not be administered in combination with any SSRI or SNRI. There have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions (including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4178904" conceptname="Body temperature above reference range">hyperthermia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4050941" conceptname="Muscle rigidity">rigidity</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441553" conceptname="Myoclonus">myoclonus</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434633" conceptname="Disorder of autonomic nervous system">autonomic instability</span> with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436222" conceptname="Altered mental status">mental status changes</span> that include extreme <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span> progressing to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373995" conceptname="Delirium">delirium</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>) in patients receiving a SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine) or a SNRI (e.g., venlafaxine) in combination with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), and in patients who have recently discontinued a SSRI or SNRI and are then started on an MAOI. Some cases presented with features resembling <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="379802" conceptname="Neuroleptic malignant syndrome">neuroleptic malignant syndrome</span>. Therefore SSRIs and SNRIs should not be used in combination with an MAOI, or within 14 days of discontinuing therapy with an MAOI. </p>
<p> Since fluoxetine and its major metabolite have very long elimination half-lives, at least 5 weeks should be allowed after stopping fluoxetine before starting an MAOI.</p>
<p> At least 2 weeks should be allowed after stopping sertraline (Zoloft<span class="Sup">®</span>, Pfizer) or paroxetine (Paxil<span class="Sup">®</span>, Paxil CR<span class="Sup">®</span>, GlaxoSmithKline) before starting an MAOI.</p>
<p> At least one week should be allowed after stopping a SNRI (e.g., venlafaxine) before starting a MAOI. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">6.   </span><span class="Bold">In</span><span class="Bold"> combination with buspirone</span></p>
<p> PARNATE should not be used in combination with buspirone HCl, since several cases of elevated blood pressure have been reported in patients taking MAO inhibitors who were then given buspirone HCl. At least 10 days should elapse between the discontinuation of PARNATE and the institution of buspirone HCl.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">7.   </span><span class="Bold">In</span><span class="Bold"> combination with sympathomimetics</span></p>
<p> PARNATE should not be administered in combination with sympathomimetics, including amphetamines which may be found in many herbal preparations as well as over-the-counter drugs such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">cold</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256439" conceptname="Allergic rhinitis due to pollen">hay fever</span> or weight-reducing preparations that contain vasoconstrictors.</p>
<p> During therapy with PARNATE, it appears that certain patients are particularly vulnerable to the effects of sympathomimetics when the activity of certain enzymes is inhibited. Use of sympathomimetics and compounds such as guanethidine, methyldopa, reserpine, dopamine, levodopa, and tryptophan with PARNATE may precipitate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, and related symptoms. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="376713" conceptname="Cerebral hemorrhage">Cerebral hemorrhage</span> may also occur.

<p> Do not use meperidine concomitantly with MAO inhibitors or within 2 or 3 weeks following MAOI therapy.

<p><span class="Bold">10.  In combination with cheese or other foods with </span><span class="Bold">a high</span><span class="Bold"> tyramine content</span></p>
<p>When excessive amounts of tyramine are consumed in conjunction with tranylcypromine, or within 2 weeks of stopping treatment, a serious and sometimes fatal hypertensive reaction may occur.</p>
<p> Tyramine occurs naturally in some foods or may occur from the bacterial breakdown of protein in foods which are fermented, aged, or spoiled. Foods that have reliably been shown to contain a high tyramine content and may also have been reported to induce a serious hypertensive reaction when consumed with tranylcypromine are:</p>
<ul>
<li>all matured or aged cheeses (note: all cheeses are considered matured or aged except fresh cottage cheese, cream cheese, ricotta, and processed cheese. All non-cheese dairy products can be consumed providing they are fresh)</li>
<li>all aged, cured or fermented meat, fish, or poultry (note: meat, fish, or poultry that has not undergone aging, curing or fermenting and that is bought fresh, stored correctly and eaten fresh is not contraindicated)</li>
<li>all fermented soybean products (e.g., soy sauce, miso, fermented tofu)</li>
<li>sauerkraut</li>
<li>fava or broad bean pods</li>
<li>banana peel (but not the pulp)</li>
<li>concentrated yeast extracts (e.g., Marmite or Vegemite spread)</li>
<li>all tap/draught beers (note: some bottled beers, including non-alcoholic beer, may also pose a risk).</li>
</ul>
<p> Patients should be advised to minimize or avoid use of all alcoholic beverages while taking PARNATE. Patients should be advised to adhere to the following dietary guidance about eating fresh foods:</p>
<p>Foods may be deliberately aged as part of their processing and these are contraindicated (<span class="Italics">see list above</span>). Foods may also naturally age over time, even if they are refrigerated. It is therefore extremely important that patients are instructed to buy and eat only fresh foods or those which have been properly frozen. They should avoid eating foods if they are unsure of their storage conditions or freshness and they should be cautious of foods of unknown age or composition even if refrigerated.</p>
<p>The longer food is left to deteriorate and the larger the quantity of food eaten, the greater the potential quantity of tyramine ingested. Where there is any doubt, patients should be advised to either avoid the food or consume it in strict moderation if it is not otherwise contraindicated.</p>
<p>Patients should also be warned that tyramine levels may vary by brand or even batch and a person may absorb different amounts of tyramine from a particular food at different times. Therefore, if they have accidentally consumed a prohibited food on one occasion and not had a reaction, this does not mean that they will not have a serious hypertensive reaction if they consume the same food on a different occasion.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">11.  </span><span class="Bold">In</span><span class="Bold"> patients undergoing elective surgery</span></p>
<p> Patients taking PARNATE should not undergo elective surgery requiring general anesthesia. Also, they should not be given cocaine or local anesthesia containing sympathomimetic vasoconstrictors. The possible combined hypotensive effects of PARNATE and spinal anesthesia should be kept in mind. PARNATE should be discontinued at least 10 days prior to elective surgery.</p>

<p class="First"> Patients with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and/or the emergence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4092095" conceptname="Planning suicide">suicidal ideation</span> and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> is a known risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18-24) with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.</p>
<p> The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440374" conceptname="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">obsessive compulsive disorder</span> (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1,000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.</p>

<p> No <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>.</p>
<p> It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"> All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. </span></p>

<h2>Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder</h2>
<p class="First">A major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive episode</span> may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic episode</span> in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4191716" conceptname="Symptoms of depression">depressive symptoms</span> should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>, bipolar disorder, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>. It should be noted that PARNATE is not approved for use in treating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436665" conceptname="Bipolar disorder">bipolar depression</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">PARNATE is a potent agent with the capability of producing serious side effects.</span> PARNATE is not recommended in those depressive reactions where other antidepressant drugs may be effective. <span class="Bold">It should be reserved for patients who can be closely supervised and who have not responded satisfactorily to the drugs more commonly administered for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.</span></p>
<p> Before prescribing, the physician should be completely familiar with the full material on dosage, side effects, and contraindications on these pages, with the principles of MAO inhibitor therapy and the side effects of this class of drugs. Also, the physician should be familiar with the symptomatology of mental <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressions</span> and alternate methods of treatment to aid in the careful selection of patients for therapy with PARNATE. </p>

<h2>Pregnancy Warning</h2>
<p class="First">Use of any drug in pregnancy, during lactation or in women of childbearing age requires that the potential benefits of the drug be weighed against its possible hazards to mother and child.</p>
<p> Animal reproductive studies show that PARNATE passes through the placental barrier into the fetus of the rat, and into the milk of the lactating dog. The absence of a harmful action of PARNATE on fertility or on postnatal development by either prenatal treatment or from the milk of treated animals has not been demonstrated. Tranylcypromine is excreted in human milk.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">The most important reaction associated with PARNATE is the occurrence of hypertensive crises which have sometimes been fatal.</span></p>
<p> These crises are characterized by some or all of the following symptoms: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">occipital headache</span> which may radiate frontally, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315078" conceptname="Palpitations">palpitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4060220" conceptname="Stiff neck">neck stiffness</span> or soreness, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span> (sometimes with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span> and sometimes with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">cold</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4308436" conceptname="Cold sweat">clammy</span> skin), and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260194" conceptname="Photophobia">photophobia</span>.

<p> In all patients taking PARNATE, blood pressure should be followed closely to detect evidence of any pressor response. It is emphasized that full reliance should not be placed on blood pressure readings, but that the patient should also be observed frequently.</p>
<p> Therapy should be discontinued immediately upon the occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315078" conceptname="Palpitations">palpitation</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">frequent headaches</span> during therapy with PARNATE.

<p> If a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312938" conceptname="Hypertensive encephalopathy">hypertensive crisis</span> occurs, PARNATE should be discontinued and therapy to lower blood pressure should be instituted immediately. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">Headache</span> tends to abate as blood pressure is lowered. On the basis of present evidence, phentolamine is recommended. (The dosage reported for phentolamine is 5 mg I.V.)

<p class="First"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> has been observed during therapy with PARNATE. Symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span> are seen most commonly but not exclusively in patients with pre-existent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>; blood pressure usually returns rapidly to pretreatment levels upon discontinuation of the drug. At doses above 30 mg daily, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span> is a major side effect and may result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">syncope</span>. Dosage increases should be made more gradually in patients showing a tendency toward <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> at the beginning of therapy. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">Postural hypotension</span> may be relieved by having the patient lie down until blood pressure returns to normal.</p>
<p> Also, when PARNATE is combined with those phenothiazine derivatives or other compounds known to cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, the possibility of additive hypotensive effects should be considered.</p>
<p> There have been reports of drug dependency in patients using doses of tranylcypromine significantly in excess of the therapeutic range. Some of these patients had a history of previous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4279309" conceptname="Substance abuse">substance abuse</span>. The following withdrawal symptoms have been reported: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">restlessness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">weakness</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>.</p>
<p> Drugs which lower the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> threshold, including MAO inhibitors, should not be used with Amipaque<span class="Sup">®*</span>. As with other MAO inhibitors, PARNATE should be discontinued at least 48 hours before myelography and should not be resumed for at least 24 hours postprocedure.</p>
<p> MAO inhibitors may have the capacity to suppress <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321318" conceptname="Angina pectoris">anginal pain</span> that would otherwise serve as a warning of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4124683" conceptname="Silent myocardial ischemia">myocardial ischemia</span>.</p>
<p> The usual precautions should be observed in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> since there is a possibility of cumulative effects in such patients.</p>
<p> Older patients may suffer more morbidity than younger patients during and following an episode of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440285" conceptname="Malignant hyperthermia">malignant hyperthermia</span>. Older patients have less compensatory reserve to cope with any serious adverse reaction. Therefore, PARNATE should be used with caution in the elderly population.</p>
<p> Although excretion of PARNATE is rapid, inhibition of MAO may persist up to 10 days following discontinuation.</p>
<p> Because the influence of PARNATE on the convulsive threshold is variable in animal experiments, suitable precautions should be taken if epileptic patients are treated.</p>
<p> Some MAO inhibitors have contributed to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemic episodes</span> in diabetic patients receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Therefore, PARNATE should be used with caution in diabetics using these drugs.</p>
<p> PARNATE may aggravate coexisting symptoms in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>.</p>
<p> Use PARNATE with caution in hyperthyroid patients because of their increased sensitivity to pressor amines.</p>
<p>PARNATE should be administered with caution to patients receiving Antabuse<span class="Sup">®†</span>. In a single study, rats given high intraperitoneal doses of <span class="Italics">d</span> or <span class="Italics">l</span> isomers of tranylcypromine sulfate plus disulfiram experienced severe toxicity including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. Additional studies in rats given high oral doses of racemic tranylcypromine sulfate (PARNATE) and disulfiram produced no adverse interaction.</p>

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with PARNATE and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about “Antidepressant Medicines, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> and Other Serious Mental Illnesses, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions? is available for PARNATE. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. </p>

Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First"> Dosage should be adjusted to the requirements of the individual patient. Improvement should be seen within 48 hours to 3 weeks after starting therapy.</p>
<p> The usual effective dosage is 30 mg per day, usually given in divided doses. If there are no signs of improvement after a reasonable period (up to 2 weeks), then the dosage may be increased in 10 mg per day increments at intervals of 1 to 3 weeks; the dosage range may be extended to a maximum of 60 mg per day from the usual 30 mg per day.</p>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p class="First"> The characteristic symptoms that may be caused by overdosage are usually those described above.</p>
<p> However, an intensification of these symptoms and sometimes severe additional manifestations may be seen, depending on the degree of overdosage and on individual susceptibility. Some patients exhibit <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">restlessness</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, progressing in severe cases to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">mental confusion</span>, and incoherence. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">weakness</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> may occur, progressing in severe cases to extreme <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span>. A few patients have displayed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> and other symptoms.

<h2>Treatment</h2>
<p class="First"> Because strategies for the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> are continually evolving, it is advisable to contact a Poison Control Center to determine the latest recommendations for the management of an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> of any drug. Telephone numbers for the certified Poison Control Centers are listed in the <span class="Italics">Physicians’ Desk Reference</span> (PDR). </p>
<p> Treatment should normally consist of general supportive measures, close observation of vital signs and steps to counteract specific symptoms as they occur, since MAO inhibition may persist. The management of hypertensive crises is described under WARNINGS in the HYPERTENSIVE CRISES section.</p>
<p> External cooling is recommended if <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260205" conceptname="Hyperpyrexia">hyperpyrexia</span> occurs. Barbiturates have been reported to help relieve myoclonic reactions, but frequency of administration should be controlled carefully because PARNATE may prolong barbiturate activity. When <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> requires treatment, the standard measures for managing circulatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span> should be initiated. If pressor agents are used, the rate of infusion should be regulated by careful observation of the patient because an exaggerated pressor response sometimes occurs in the presence of MAO inhibition. Remember that the toxic effect of PARNATE may be delayed or prolonged following the last dose of the drug. Therefore, the patient should be closely observed for at least a week. It is not known if tranylcypromine is dialyzable.</p>
