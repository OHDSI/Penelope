<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">LuxÃ­q Foam contains betamethasone valerate, USP, a synthetic corticosteroid, for topical dermatologic use. The corticosteroids constitute a class of primarily synthetic steroids used topically as anti-inflammatory agents.</p>
<p>Betamethasone valerate is 9-fluoro11ÃŸ,17, 21-trihydroxy-16ÃŸ-methylpregna-1, 4-diene-3, 20-dione 17-valerate, with the empirical formula C<span class="Sub">27</span>H<span class="Sub">37</span>FO<span class="Sub">6</span>, a molecular weight of 476.58.The following is the chemical structure:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="betamethasone valerate chemical structure" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=3dab9411-df12-4073-9cc1-3273e2aee7e7&amp;name=1da0c84f-97c7-4ded-b903-beb8786cc804-01.jpg"></div>
<p>Betamethasone valerate is a white to practically white, odorless crystalline powder, and is practically insoluble in water, freely soluble in acetone and in chloroform, soluble in alcohol, and slightly soluble in benzene and in ether.</p>
<p>LuxÃ­q<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (betamethasone valerate) Foam, 0.12%, contains 1.2 mg betamethasone valerate, USP, per gram in a thermolabile hydroethanolic foam vehicle consisting of cetyl alcohol, citric acid, ethanol (60.4%), polysorbate 60, potassium citrate, propylene glycol, purified water, and stearyl alcohol pressurized with a hydrocarbon (propane/butane) propellant.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Like other topical corticosteroids, betamethasone valerate foam has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A<span class="Sub">2</span> inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A<span class="Sub">2</span>.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from intact healthy skin. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusion, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> and/or other disease processes in the skin may also increase percutaneous absorption.</p>
<p>The use of pharmacodynamic endpoints for assessing the systemic exposure of topical corticosteroids is necessary due to the fact that circulating levels are well below the level of detection. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. They are metabolized, primarily in the liver, and are then excreted by the kidneys. In addition, some corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted in the bile.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First">The safety and efficacy of LuxÃ­q has been demonstrated in a four-week trial. An adequate and well-controlled clinical trial was conducted in 190 patients with moderate to severe scalp <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span>. Patients were treated twice daily for four weeks with LuxÃ­q Foam, Placebo foam, a commercially available betamethasone valerate lotion 0.12% (formerly expressed as 0.1% betamethasone), or Placebo lotion. At four weeks of treatment, study results of 159 patients demonstrated that the efficacy of LuxÃ­q Foam in treating scalp <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span> is superior to that of Placebo foam, and is comparable to that of a currently marketed BMV lotion (see Table below).</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has caused reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Manifestations of Cushingâ€™s syndrome, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span>, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on treatment.</p>
<p>Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings.</p>
<p>Therefore, patients applying a topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid.</p>
<p>Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency may occur requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. For information on systemic supplementation, see prescribing information for those products. </p>
<p>Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> ratios. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_pediatric_use_id_2f91c17b-fcfc-4071-b522-61d0145b5f0f">PRECAUTIONS-Pediatric Use</a></span>.)</p>
<p>If irritation develops, LuxÃ­q should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134438" conceptname="Contact dermatitis">Allergic contact dermatitis</span> with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation, as with most topical products not containing corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing.</p>
<p>In the presence of dermatological <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span>, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of LuxÃ­q should be discontinued until the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> has been adequately controlled.</p>

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions:</p>
<ol>
<li>This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes.</li>
<li>This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed.</li>
<li>The treated scalp area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped so as to be occlusive unless directed by the physician.</li>
<li>Patients should report to their physician any signs of local adverse reactions.</li>
<li>As with other corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, contact the physician.</li>

<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">The following tests may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression:</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential or the effect on fertility of betamethasone valerate.</p>
<p>Betamethasone was genotoxic in the <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay with metabolic activation and in the <span class="Italics">in vivo </span>mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay.</p>

<h2>Pregnancy Category C</h2>
<p class="First">Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, LuxÃ­q should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<p>Drugs of this class should not be used extensively on pregnant patients, in large amounts, or for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4088438" conceptname="Prolonged periods">prolonged periods</span> of time.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when LuxÃ­q is administered to a nursing woman.</p>

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span>, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of HPA axis suppression and Cushingâ€™s syndrome when they are treated with topical corticosteroids. They are therefore also at greater risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="193984" conceptname="Adrenal hypofunction">adrenal insufficiency</span> during and/or after withdrawal of treatment. Adverse effects including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137054" conceptname="Skin striae">striae</span> have been reported with inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids in infants and children.</p>

Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include low plasma cortisol levels and an absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154803" conceptname="Raised intracranial pressure">intracranial hypertension</span> include bulging fontanelles, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headaches</span>, and bilateral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4308632" conceptname="Optic disc edema">papilledema</span>.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Note: For proper dispensing of foam, can must be inverted.</p>
<p>For application to the scalp invert can and dispense a small amount of LuxÃ­q onto a saucer or other cool surface. Do not dispense directly onto hands as foam will begin to melt immediately upon contact with warm skin. Pick up small amounts of foam with fingers and gently massage into affected area until foam disappears. Repeat until entire affected scalp area is treated. Apply twice daily, once in the morning and once at night.</p>
<p>As with other corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, reassessment of the diagnosis may be necessary.</p>
<p>LuxÃ­q should not be used with occlusive dressings unless directed by a physician.</p>
