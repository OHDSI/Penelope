<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">NUVIGIL<span class="Sup">®</span> (armodafinil) is a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4100068" conceptname="Wakefulness">wakefulness</span>-promoting agent for oral administration. Armodafinil is the R-enantiomer of modafinil which is a mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers. The chemical name for armodafinil is 2-[(R)-(diphenylmethyl)sulfinyl]acetamide. The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">15</span>H<span class="Sub">15</span>NO<span class="Sub">2</span>S and the molecular weight is 273.35.</p>
<p>The chemical structure is:</p>
<p><img alt="chemical structure" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=10f918f7-4782-470e-a50e-35c7c66bfd79&amp;name=10f918f7-4782-470e-a50e-35c7c66bfd79-01.jpg"></p>
<p>Armodafinil exists in multiple crystalline forms. Form I, which is used in NUVIGIL, is the least soluble form of armodafinil and is a white to off-white, crystalline powder that is very slightly soluble in water, sparingly soluble in acetone and soluble in methanol. At least 90% of the armodafinil particles used in NUVIGIL have a diameter less than 200 microns. </p>
<p>NUVIGIL tablets contain 50, 150, or 250 mg of armodafinil and the following inactive ingredients: croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, and pregelatinized starch.</p>

<h2> Mechanism of Action and Pharmacology</h2>
<p class="First">The precise mechanism(s) through which armodafinil (R-enantiomer) or modafinil (mixture of R- and S-enantiomers) promote <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4100068" conceptname="Wakefulness">wakefulness</span> is unknown. Both armodafinil and modafinil have shown similar pharmacological properties in nonclinical animal and in vitro studies, to the extent tested.</p>
<p>At pharmacologically relevant concentrations, armodafinil does not bind to or inhibit several receptors and enzymes potentially relevant for sleep/wake regulation, including those for serotonin, dopamine, adenosine, galanin, melatonin, melanocortin, orexin-1, orphanin, PACAP or benzodiazepines, or transporters for GABA, serotonin, norepinephrine, and choline or phosphodiesterase VI, COMT, GABA transaminase, and tyrosine hydroxylase. Modafinil does not inhibit the activity of MAO-B or phosphodiesterases II-IV.</p>
<p>Modafinil-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4100068" conceptname="Wakefulness">wakefulness</span> can be attenuated by the α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, prazosin; however, modafinil is inactive in other in vitro  assay systems known to be responsive to α-adrenergic agonists such as the rat vas deferens preparation.</p>
<p>Armodafinil is not a direct- or indirect-acting dopamine receptor agonist. However, in vitro, both armodafinil and modafinil bind to the dopamine transporter and inhibit dopamine reuptake. For modafinil, this activity has been associated in vivo with increased extracellular dopamine levels in some brain regions of animals. In genetically engineered mice lacking the dopamine transporter (DAT), modafinil lacked wake-promoting activity, suggesting that this activity was DAT-dependent. However, the wake-promoting effects of modafinil, unlike those of amphetamine, were not antagonized by the dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol in rats. In addition, alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, a dopamine synthesis inhibitor, blocks the action of amphetamine, but does not block locomotor activity induced by modafinil.</p>
<p>Armodafinil and modafinil have wake-promoting actions similar to sympathomimetic agents including amphetamine and methylphenidate, although their pharmacologic profile is not identical to that of the sympathomimetic amines. In addition to its wake-promoting effects and ability to increase locomotor activity in animals, modafinil produces psychoactive and euphoric effects, alterations in mood, perception, thinking, and feelings typical of other CNS stimulants in humans. Modafinil has reinforcing properties, as evidenced by its self-administration in monkeys previously trained to self-administer cocaine; modafinil was also partially discriminated as stimulant-like. </p>
<p>Based on nonclinical studies, two major metabolites, acid and sulfone, of modafinil or armodafinil, do not appear to contribute to the CNS-activating properties of the parent compounds.</p>

<h2> Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">The active component of NUVIGIL is armodafinil, which is the longer-lived enantiomer of modafinil. NUVIGIL exhibits linear time-independent kinetics following single and multiple oral dose administration. Increase in systemic exposure is proportional over the dose range of 50 to 400 mg. No time-dependent change in kinetics was observed through 12 weeks of dosing. Apparent steady state for NUVIGIL was reached within 7 days of dosing. At steady state, the systemic exposure for NUVIGIL is 1.8 times the exposure observed after a single dose. The concentration-time profiles of the pure R-enantiomer following administration of 50 mg NUVIGIL or 100 mg PROVIGIL<span class="Sup">®</span> (modafinil) are nearly superimposable.  </p>

<h3> Absorption </h3>
<p class="First">NUVIGIL is readily absorbed after oral administration. The absolute oral bioavailability was not determined due to the aqueous insolubility of armodafinil, which precluded intravenous administration. Peak plasma concentrations are attained at approximately 2 hours in the fasted state. Food effect on the overall bioavailability of NUVIGIL is considered minimal; however, time to reach peak concentration (t<span class="Sub">max</span>) may be delayed by approximately 2-4 hours in the fed state. Since the delay in t<span class="Sub">max</span> is also associated with elevated plasma levels later in time, food can potentially affect the onset and time course of pharmacologic action for NUVIGIL. </p>

<h3> Distribution </h3>
<p class="First">NUVIGIL has an apparent volume of distribution of approximately 42 L. Data specific to armodafinil protein binding are not available. However, modafinil is moderately bound to plasma protein (approximately 60%), mainly to albumin. The potential for interactions of NUVIGIL with highly protein-bound drugs is considered to be minimal.</p>

<h3> Metabolism </h3>
<p class="First">In vitro and in vivo data show that armodafinil undergoes hydrolytic deamidation, S-oxidation, and aromatic ring hydroxylation, with subsequent glucuronide conjugation of the hydroxylated products. Amide hydrolysis is the single most prominent metabolic pathway, with sulfone formation by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4/5 being next in importance. The other oxidative products are formed too slowly in vitro to enable identification of the enzyme(s) responsible. Only two metabolites reach appreciable concentrations in plasma (i.e., R-modafinil acid and modafinil sulfone). </p>
<p>Data specific to NUVIGIL disposition are not available. However, modafinil is mainly eliminated via metabolism, predominantly in the liver, with less than 10% of the parent compound excreted in the urine. A total of 81% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in 11 days post-dose, predominantly in the urine (80% vs. 1.0% in the feces). </p>

<h3> Elimination </h3>
<p class="First">After oral administration of NUVIGIL, armodafinil exhibits an apparent monoexponential decline from the peak plasma concentration. The apparent terminal t½ is approximately 15 hours. The oral clearance of NUVIGIL is approximately 33 mL/min.</p>

<h3> Drug-Drug Interactions </h3>
<p class="First">   </p>
<p>The existence of multiple pathways for armodafinil metabolism, as well as the fact that a non-CYP-related pathway is the most rapid in metabolizing armodafinil, suggest that there is a low probability of substantive effects on the overall pharmacokinetic profile of NUVIGIL due to CYP inhibition by concomitant medications.</p>
<p>In vitro data demonstrated that armodafinil shows a weak inductive response for CYP1A2 and possibly CYP3A activities in a concentration-related manner and that CYP2C19 activity is reversibly inhibited by armodafinil. Other CYP activities did not appear to be affected by armodafinil. An in vitro study demonstrated that armodafinil is a substrate of P-glycoprotein.</p>
<p>Chronic administration of NUVIGIL at 250 mg reduced the systemic exposure to midazolam by 32% and 17% after single oral (5 mg) and intravenous (2 mg) doses, respectively, suggesting that administration of NUVIGIL moderately induces CYP3A activity. Drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4/5, such as cyclosporine, may require dosage adjustment. (See<span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_interactions_id_03774081-279e-4207-8f50-08c432e02461">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</a></span>).</p>
<p>Chronic administration of NUVIGIL at 250 mg did not affect the pharmacokinetics of caffeine (200 mg), a probe substrate for CYP1A2 activity.</p>
<p>Coadministration of a single 400-mg dose of NUVIGIL with omeprazole (40 mg) increased systemic exposure to omeprazole by approximately 40%, indicating that armodafinil moderately inhibits CYP2C19 activity. Drugs that are substrates for CYP2C19 may require dosage reduction. (See<span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_interactions_id_03774081-279e-4207-8f50-08c432e02461">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</a></span>).</p>

<h4>Age Effect:</h4>
<p class="First">A slight decrease (~20%) in the oral clearance (CL/F) of modafinil was observed in a single dose study at 200 mg in 12 subjects with a mean age of 63 years (range 53 – 72 years), but the change was considered not likely to be clinically significant. In a multiple dose study (300 mg/day) in 12 patients with a mean age of 82 years (range 67 – 87 years), the mean levels of modafinil in plasma were approximately two times those historically obtained in matched younger subjects. Due to potential effects from the multiple concomitant medications with which most of the patients were being treated, the apparent difference in modafinil pharmacokinetics may not be attributable solely to the effects of aging. However, the results suggest that the clearance of modafinil may be reduced in the elderly (See<span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_42fbafad-bd93-489d-bd4e-923f8cbc5623">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>

<h4><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic Impairment</span>:</h4>
<p class="First">The pharmacokinetics and metabolism of modafinil were examined in patients with cirrhosis of the liver (6 men and 3 women). Three patients had stage B or B+ cirrhosis and 6 patients had stage C or C+ cirrhosis (per the Child-Pugh score criteria). Clinically 8 of 9 patients were icteric and all had <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200528" conceptname="Ascites">ascites</span>. In these patients, the oral clearance of modafinil was decreased by about 60% and the steady state concentration was doubled compared to normal patients.

<h2> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313459" conceptname="Sleep apnea">Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome</span> (OSA)</h2>
<p class="First">The effectiveness of NUVIGIL in improving <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4100068" conceptname="Wakefulness">wakefulness</span> in patients with excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> associated with OSA was established in two 12-week, multi-center, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind studies of outpatients who met the International Classification of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435524" conceptname="Sleep disorder">Sleep Disorders</span> (ICSD) criteria for OSA (which are also consistent with the American Psychiatric Association DSM-IV criteria). These criteria include either, 1) excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, plus frequent episodes of impaired breathing during sleep, and associated features such as loud <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4248728" conceptname="Snoring">snoring</span>, morning <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headaches</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226991" conceptname="Aptyalism">dry mouth</span> upon awakening; or 2) excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>; and polysomnography demonstrating one of the following: more than five obstructive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apneas</span>, each greater than 10 seconds in duration, per hour of sleep; and one or more of the following: frequent arousals from sleep associated with the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apneas</span>, bradytachycardia, or arterial oxygen desaturation in association with the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apneas</span>. In addition, for entry into these studies, all patients were required to have excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> as demonstrated by a score ≥ 10 on the Epworth <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">Sleepiness</span> Scale, despite treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Evidence that CPAP was effective in reducing episodes of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span>/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302536" conceptname="Shallow breathing">hypopnea</span> was required along with documentation of CPAP use.</p>
<p>Patients were required to be compliant with CPAP, defined as CPAP use ≥ 4 hours/night on ≥ 70% of nights. CPAP use continued throughout the study. In both studies, the primary measures of effectiveness were 1) sleep latency, as assessed by the Maintenance of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4100068" conceptname="Wakefulness">Wakefulness</span> Test (MWT) and 2) the change in the patient’s overall disease status, as measured by the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) at the final visit. For a successful trial both measures had to show statistically significant improvement.</p>
<p>The MWT measures latency (in minutes) to sleep onset. An extended MWT was performed with test sessions at 2 hour intervals between 9AM and 7PM. The primary analysis was the average of the sleep latencies from the first four test sessions (9AM to 3PM). For each test session, the subject was asked to attempt to remain awake without using extraordinary measures. Each test session was terminated after 30 minutes if no sleep occurred or immediately after sleep onset. The CGI-C is a 7-point scale, centered at <span class="Italics">No Change</span>, and ranging from <span class="Italics">Very Much Worse</span> to <span class="Italics">Very Much Improved</span>. Evaluators were not given any specific guidance about the criteria they were to apply when rating patients.</p>
<p>In the first study, a total of 395 patients with OSA were randomized to receive NUVIGIL 150 mg/day, NUVIGIL 250 mg/day or matching placebo. Patients treated with NUVIGIL showed a statistically significant improvement in the ability to remain awake compared to placebo-treated patients as measured by the MWT at final visit. A statistically significant greater number of patients treated with NUVIGIL showed improvement in overall clinical condition as rated by the CGI-C scale at final visit. The average sleep latencies (in minutes) in the MWT at baseline for the trials are shown in Table 1 below, along with the average change from baseline on the MWT at final visit. The percentages of patients who showed any degree of improvement on the CGI-C in the clinical trials are shown in Table 2 below. The two doses of NUVIGIL produced statistically significant effects of similar magnitudes on the MWT, and also on the CGI-C.</p>
<p>In the second study, 263 patients with OSA were randomized to either NUVIGIL 150 mg/day or placebo. Patients treated with NUVIGIL showed a statistically significant improvement in the ability to remain awake compared to placebo-treated patients as measured by the MWT [Table 1]. A statistically significant greater number of patients treated with NUVIGIL showed improvement in overall clinical condition as rated by the CGI-C scale [Table 2].</p>
<p>Nighttime sleep measured with polysomnography was not affected by the use of NUVIGIL in either study.</p>

<p>The primary measures of effectiveness were: 1) sleep latency as assessed by the Maintenance of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4100068" conceptname="Wakefulness">Wakefulness</span> Test (MWT) and 2) the change in the patient’s overall disease status, as measured by the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) at the final visit (See <span class="Bold">CLINICAL TRIALS, </span><span class="Italics">OSA</span> section above for a description of these measures). Each MWT test session was terminated after 20 minutes if no sleep occurred or immediately after sleep onset in this study. </p>
<p>Patients treated with NUVIGIL showed a statistically significantly enhanced ability to remain awake on the MWT at each dose compared to placebo at final visit [Table 1]. A statistically significant greater number of patients treated with NUVIGIL at each dose showed improvement in overall clinical condition as rated by the CGI-C scale at final visit [Table 2].</p>
<p>The two doses of NUVIGIL produced statistically significant effects of similar magnitudes on the CGI-C. Although a statistically significant effect on the MWT was observed for each dose, the magnitude of effect was observed to be greater for the higher dose.</p>
<p>Nighttime sleep measured with polysomnography was not affected by the use of NUVIGIL.</p>

<h2> Shift Work Disorder (SWD)</h2>
<p class="First">The effectiveness of NUVIGIL in improving <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4100068" conceptname="Wakefulness">wakefulness</span> in patients with excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> associated with SWD was demonstrated in a 12-week, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, clinical trial. A total of 254 patients with chronic SWD were randomized to receive NUVIGIL 150 mg/day or placebo. All patients met the ICSD criteria for chronic SWD [which are consistent with the American Psychiatric Association DSM-IV criteria for Circadian Rhythm <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435524" conceptname="Sleep disorder">Sleep Disorder</span>: Shift Work Type]. These criteria include 1) either: a) a primary complaint of excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> which is temporally associated with a work period (usually night work) that occurs during the habitual sleep phase, or b) polysomnography and the MSLT demonstrate loss of a normal sleep-wake pattern (i.e., disturbed chronobiological rhythmicity); and 2) no other medical or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432586" conceptname="Mental disorder">mental disorder</span> accounts for the symptoms, and 3) the symptoms do not meet criteria for any other <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435524" conceptname="Sleep disorder">sleep disorder</span> producing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> or excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> (e.g., time zone change [jet lag] syndrome).</p>
<p>It should be noted that not all patients with a complaint of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> who are also engaged in shift work meet the criteria for the diagnosis of SWD. In the clinical trial, only patients who were symptomatic for at least 3 months were enrolled. </p>
<p>Enrolled patients were also required to work a minimum of 5 night shifts per month, have excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> at the time of their night shifts (MSLT score ≤ 6 minutes), and have daytime <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> documented by a daytime polysomnogram (PSG).</p>
<p>The primary measures of effectiveness were 1) sleep latency, as assessed by the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) performed during a simulated night shift at the final visit, and 2) the change in the patient’s overall disease status, as measured by the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) at the final visit. (See<span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_clinical_studies_id_01f0facc-cb45-4acb-929c-78833d59be5f">CLINICAL TRIALS</a></span>, <span class="Italics"><a href="#i4i_section_id_7f620ff1-c924-452d-b095-fecf16c630fd"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436100" conceptname="Narcolepsy">Narcolepsy</span></a></span> and<span class="Italics"><a href="#i4i_section_id_186c0551-3dba-48ad-b543-d84271d6e34f">OSA </a></span>sections above for description of these measures).</p>
<p>Patients treated with NUVIGIL showed a statistically significant prolongation in the time to sleep onset compared to placebo-treated patients, as measured by the nighttime MSLT at final visit [Table 1]. A statistically significant greater number of patients treated with NUVIGIL showed improvement in overall clinical condition as rated by the CGI-C scale at final visit [Table 2].</p>
<p>Daytime sleep measured with polysomnography was not affected by the use of NUVIGIL.</p>

<h1> INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">NUVIGIL is indicated to improve <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4100068" conceptname="Wakefulness">wakefulness</span> in patients with excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> associated with obstructive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313459" conceptname="Sleep apnea">sleep apnea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436100" conceptname="Narcolepsy">narcolepsy</span> and shift work disorder.</p>
<p>In OSA, NUVIGIL is indicated as an adjunct to standard treatment(s) for the underlying obstruction. If continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the treatment of choice for a patient, a maximal effort to treat with CPAP for an adequate period of time should be made prior to initiating NUVIGIL. If NUVIGIL is used adjunctively with CPAP, the encouragement of and periodic assessment of CPAP compliance is necessary. </p>
<p>In all cases, careful attention to the diagnosis and treatment of the underlying <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435524" conceptname="Sleep disorder">sleep disorder</span>(s) is of utmost importance. Prescribers should be aware that some patients may have more than one <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435524" conceptname="Sleep disorder">sleep disorder</span> contributing to their excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span>.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of NUVIGIL in long-term use (greater than 12 weeks) has not been systematically evaluated in placebo-controlled trials. The physician who elects to prescribe NUVIGIL for an extended time in patients should periodically re-evaluate long-term usefulness for the individual patient.</p>

<h2>  Multi-organ <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">Hypersensitivity Reactions</span> </h2>
<p class="First">Multi-organ <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span>, including at least one fatality in postmarketing experience, have occurred in close temporal association (median time to detection 13 days: range 4-33) to the initiation of modafinil. A similar risk of multi-organ <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span> with armodafinil cannot be ruled out. </p>
<p>Although there have been a limited number of reports, multi-organ <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span> may result in hospitalization or be life-threatening.

<h2><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4294810" conceptname="Psychiatric symptom">Psychiatric Symptoms</span></span></h2>
<p class="First">Psychiatric adverse experiences have been reported in patients treated with modafinil. Modafinil and armodafinil (NUVIGIL) are very closely related. Therefore, the incidence and type of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4294810" conceptname="Psychiatric symptom">psychiatric symptoms</span> associated with armodafinil are expected to be similar to the incidence and type of these events with modafinil.</p>
<p>Postmarketing adverse events associated with the use of modafinil have included <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">mania</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="444401" conceptname="Delusions">delusions</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4092095" conceptname="Planning suicide">suicidal ideation</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021344" conceptname="Abusive behavior">aggression</span>, some resulting in hospitalization. Many, but not all, patients had a prior psychiatric history. One healthy male volunteer developed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4165403" conceptname="Ideas of reference">ideas of reference</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="444401" conceptname="Delusions">paranoid delusions</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4164151" conceptname="Auditory hallucinations">auditory hallucinations</span> in association with multiple daily 600 mg doses of modafinil and sleep deprivation. There was no evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychosis</span> 36 hours after drug discontinuation.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">CPAP Use in Patients with OSA</span></h2>
<p class="First">In OSA, NUVIGIL is indicated as an adjunct to standard treatment(s) for the underlying obstruction. If continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the treatment of choice for a patient, a maximal effort to treat with CPAP for an adequate period of time should be made prior to initiating NUVIGIL. If NUVIGIL is used adjunctively with CPAP, the encouragement of and periodic assessment of CPAP compliance is necessary. There was a slight trend for reduced CPAP use over time (mean reduction of 18 minutes for patients treated with NUVIGIL and a 6 minute reduction for placebo-treated patients from a mean baseline use of 6.9 hours per night) in NUVIGIL trials.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold"> General</span></h2>
<p class="First">Although NUVIGIL has not been shown to produce functional impairment, any drug affecting the CNS may alter judgment, thinking or motor skills. Patients should be cautioned about operating an automobile or other hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that NUVIGIL therapy will not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities.</p>

<p>Blood pressure monitoring in short-term (≤ 3 months) controlled trials showed only small average increases in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients receiving NUVIGIL as compared to placebo (1.2 to 4.3 mmHg in the various experimental groups). There was also a slightly greater proportion of patients on NUVIGIL requiring new or increased use of antihypertensive medications (2.9%) compared to patients on placebo (1.8%). Increased monitoring of blood pressure may be appropriate in patients on NUVIGIL.</p>

<h2> Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Physicians are advised to discuss the following issues with patients for whom they prescribe NUVIGIL.</p>
<p>NUVIGIL is indicated for patients who have abnormal levels of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span>. NUVIGIL has been shown to improve, but not eliminate, this abnormal tendency to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> asleep.

<h3>  Potential Interactions with Drugs That Inhibit, Induce, or Are Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes and Other Hepatic Enzymes </h3>
<p class="First">Due to the partial involvement of CYP3A enzymes in the metabolic elimination of armodafinil, coadministration of potent inducers of CYP3A4/5 (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, rifampin) or inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 (e.g., ketoconazole, erythromycin) could alter the plasma levels of armodafinil.</p>

<h4>Drugs Metabolized by CYP1A2</h4>
<p class="First">In vitro data demonstrated that armodafinil shows a weak inductive response for CYP1A2 and possibly CYP3A activities in a concentration related manner and demonstrated that CYP2C19 activity is reversibly inhibited by armodafinil. However, the effect on CYP1A2 activity was not observed clinically in an interaction study performed with caffeine (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_pharmacokinetics_id_731a8e2c-3409-4acb-9d0f-bede081e0427">Pharmacokinetics</a></span>, <span class="Italics"><a href="#i4i_interactions_id_df047744-42e5-4004-81af-9e169ebf789d">Drug-Drug Interactions</a></span>).   </p>

<h4>Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A4/5 (e.g., cyclosporine, ethinyl estradiol, midazolam and triazolam) </h4>
<p class="First">Chronic administration of NUVIGIL resulted in moderate induction of CYP3A activity. Hence, the effectiveness of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A enzymes (e.g., cyclosporine, ethinyl estradiol, midazolam and triazolam) may be reduced after initiation of concurrent treatment with NUVIGIL. A 32% reduction in systemic exposure of oral midazolam was seen upon concomitant administration of armodafinil with midazolam. Dose adjustment may be required (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_pharmacokinetics_id_731a8e2c-3409-4acb-9d0f-bede081e0427">Pharmacokinetics</a></span>, <span class="Italics"><a href="#i4i_interactions_id_df047744-42e5-4004-81af-9e169ebf789d">Drug-Drug Interactions</a></span>). Such effects (reduced concentrations) were also seen upon concomitant administration of modafinil with cyclosporine, ethinyl estradiol, and triazolam.   </p>

<h4>Drugs Metabolized by CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole, diazepam, phenytoin, and propranolol) </h4>
<p class="First">Administration of NUVIGIL resulted in moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 activity. Hence, dosage reduction may be required for some drugs that are substrates for CYP2C19 (e.g., phenytoin, diazepam, and propranolol, omeprazole and clomipramine) when used concurrently with NUVIGIL. A 40% increase in exposure was seen upon concomitant administration of armodafinil with omeprazole. (See<span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_pharmacokinetics_id_731a8e2c-3409-4acb-9d0f-bede081e0427">Pharmacokinetics</a></span>, <span class="Italics"><a href="#i4i_interactions_id_df047744-42e5-4004-81af-9e169ebf789d">Drug-Drug Interactions</a></span>).   </p>

<h3>  Interactions with CNS Active Drugs </h3>
<p class="First">Data specific to armodafinil drug-drug interaction potential with CNS active drugs are not available. However, the following available drug-drug interaction information on modafinil should be applicable to armodafinil (See<span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_description_id_408e240f-d4e5-41f6-a3a1-55990de9f238">DESCRIPTION</a></span>and <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_clinical_pharmacology_id_002a70ca-43b7-4f7c-a41a-89cb00eaa121">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span>). </p>
<p>Concomitant administration of modafinil with methylphenidate, or dextroamphetamine produced no significant alterations on the pharmacokinetic profile of modafinil or either stimulant, even though the absorption of modafinil was delayed for approximately one hour. </p>
<p>Concomitant modafinil or clomipramine did not alter the PK profile of either drug; however, one incident of increased levels of clomipramine and its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine was reported in a patient with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436100" conceptname="Narcolepsy">narcolepsy</span> during treatment with modafinil. </p>

<h4> Warfarin </h4>
<p class="First">Concomitant administration of modafinil with warfarin did not produce significant changes in the pharmacokinetic profiles of R- and S-warfarin. However, since only a single dose of warfarin was tested in this study, a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacodynamic interaction</span> cannot be ruled out.

<h3> Carcinogenesis </h3>
<p class="First">Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with armodafinil alone. Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in which modafinil was administered in the diet to mice for 78 weeks and to rats for 104 weeks at doses of 6, 30, and 60 mg/kg/day. The highest dose studied represents 1.5 (mouse) or 3 (rat) times greater than the recommended adult human daily dose of modafinil (200 mg) on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. There was no evidence of tumorigenesis associated with modafinil administration in these studies. However, since the mouse study used an inadequate high dose that was not representative of a maximum tolerated dose, a subsequent carcinogenicity study was conducted in the Tg.AC transgenic mouse. Doses evaluated in the Tg.AC assay were 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg/day, administered dermally. There was no evidence of tumorigenicity associated with modafinil administration; however, this dermal model may not adequately assess the carcinogenic potential of an orally administered drug. </p>

<h3> Impairment of Fertility </h3>
<p class="First">A fertility and early embryonic development (to implantation) study was not conducted with armodafinil alone. </p>
<p>Oral administration of modafinil (doses of up to 480 mg/kg/day) to male and female rats prior to and throughout mating, and continuing in females through day 7 of gestation produced an increase in the time to mate at the highest dose; no effects were observed on other fertility or reproductive parameters. The no-effect dose of 240 mg/kg/day was associated with a plasma modafinil exposure (AUC) approximately equal to that in humans at the recommended dose of 200 mg. </p>

<h3> Pregnancy Category C</h3>
<p class="First">In studies conducted in rats (armodafinil, modafinil) and rabbits (modafinil), developmental toxicity was observed at clinically relevant exposures. </p>
<p>Oral administration of armodafinil (60, 200, or 600 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats throughout the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of fetal visceral and skeletal variations at the intermediate dose or greater and decreased fetal body weights at the highest dose. The no-effect dose for rat embryofetal developmental toxicity was associated with a plasma armodafinil exposure (AUC) approximately 0.03 times the AUC in humans at the maximum recommended daily dose of 250 mg. </p>
<p>Modafinil (50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day) administered orally to pregnant rats throughout the period of organogenesis caused, in the absence of maternal toxicity, an increase in resorptions and an increased incidence of visceral and skeletal variations in the offspring at the highest dose. The higher no-effect dose for rat embryofetal developmental toxicity was associated with a plasma modafinil exposure approximately 0.5 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily dose (RHD) of 200 mg. However, in a subsequent study of up to 480 mg/kg/day (plasma modafinil exposure approximately 2 times the AUC in humans at the RHD) no adverse effects on embryofetal development were observed. </p>
<p>Modafinil administered orally to pregnant rabbits throughout the period of organogenesis at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day (plasma modafinil AUC approximately equal to the AUC in humans at the RHD) had no effect on embryofetal development; however, the doses used were too low to adequately assess the effects of modafinil on embryofetal development. In a subsequent developmental toxicity study evaluating doses of 45, 90, and 180 mg/kg/day in pregnant rabbits, the incidences of fetal structural alterations and embryofetal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> were increased at the highest dose. The highest no-effect dose for developmental toxicity was associated with a plasma modafinil AUC approximately equal to the AUC in humans at the RHD. </p>
<p>Modafinil administration to rats throughout gestation and lactation at oral doses of up to 200 mg/kg/day resulted in decreased viability in the offspring at doses greater than 20 mg/kg/day (plasma modafinil AUC approximately 0.1 times the AUC in humans at the RHD). No effects on postnatal developmental and neurobehavioral parameters were observed in surviving offspring. </p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of either armodafinil or modafinil in pregnant women. Two cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80204" conceptname="Fetal growth restriction">intrauterine growth retardation</span> and one case of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4067106" conceptname="Miscarriage">spontaneous abortion</span> have been reported in association with armodafinil and modafinil. Although the pharmacology of armodafinil is not identical to that of the sympathomimetic amines, it does share some pharmacologic properties with this class. </p>
<p>Certain of these drugs have been associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80204" conceptname="Fetal growth restriction">intrauterine growth retardation</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4067106" conceptname="Miscarriage">spontaneous abortions</span>. Whether the cases reported with armodafinil are drug-related is unknown. </p>
<p>Armodafinil or modafinil should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. </p>
<p>Pregnancy Registry: A pregnancy registry has been established to collect information on the pregnancy outcomes of women exposed to NUVIGIL. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register pregnant patients, or pregnant women may enroll themselves in the registry by calling 1-866-404-4106 (toll free).</p>

<h1> ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Armodafinil has been evaluated for safety in over 1100 patients with excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> associated with primary disorders of sleep and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4100068" conceptname="Wakefulness">wakefulness</span>. In clinical trials, NUVIGIL has been found to be generally well tolerated and most adverse experiences were mild to moderate. </p>
<p>In the placebo-controlled clinical studies, the most commonly observed adverse events (≥ 5%) associated with the use of NUVIGIL occurring more frequently than in the placebo-treated patients were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>. The adverse event profile was similar across the studies. </p>
<p>In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, 44 of the 645 patients (7%) who received NUVIGIL discontinued due to an adverse experience compared to 16 of the 445 (4%) of patients that received placebo.

<h2> Incidence in Controlled Trials</h2>
<p class="First">The following table (Table 3) presents the adverse experiences that occurred at a rate of 1% or more and were more frequent in patients treated with NUVIGIL than in placebo group patients in the placebo-controlled clinical trials.</p>
<p>The prescriber should be aware that the figures provided below cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse experiences in the course of usual medical practice, where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those occurring during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, or investigators. Review of these frequencies, however, provides prescribers with a basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to the incidence of adverse events in the population studied.</p>

<h2> Abuse Potential and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">Dependence</span></h2>
<p class="First">Although the abuse potential of armodafinil has not been specifically studied, its abuse potential is likely to be similar to that of modafinil (PROVIGIL). In humans, modafinil produces psychoactive and euphoric effects, alterations in mood, perception, thinking and feelings typical of other CNS stimulants. In in vitro binding studies, modafinil binds to the dopamine reuptake site and causes an increase in extracellular dopamine, but no increase in dopamine release. Modafinil is reinforcing, as evidenced by its self-administration in monkeys previously trained to self-administer cocaine. In some studies, modafinil was also partially discriminated as stimulant-like. Physicians should follow patients closely, especially those with a history of drug and/or stimulant (e.g., methylphenidate, amphetamine, or cocaine) abuse. Patients should be observed for signs of misuse or abuse (e.g., incrementation of doses or drug-seeking behavior).</p>
<p>The abuse potential of modafinil (200, 400, and 800 mg) was assessed relative to methylphenidate (45 and 90 mg) in an inpatient study in individuals experienced with drugs of abuse. Results from this clinical study demonstrated that modafinil produced psychoactive and euphoric effects and feelings consistent with other scheduled CNS stimulants (methylphenidate). </p>

<h2> Human Experience</h2>
<p class="First">There were no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> reported in the NUVIGIL clinical studies. Symptoms of NUVIGIL <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> are likely to be similar to those of modafinil. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">Overdose</span> in modafinil clinical trials included excitation or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, and slight or moderate elevations in hemodynamic parameters.

<p>Drugs that are largely eliminated via CYP2C19 metabolism, such as diazepam, propranolol, and phenytoin may have prolonged elimination upon coadministration with NUVIGIL and may require dosage reduction and monitoring for toxicity (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_precautions_id_e5720f17-4991-43a1-917f-909eb2493550">PRECAUTIONS</a>, <a href="#i4i_interactions_id_03774081-279e-4207-8f50-08c432e02461">Drug Interactions</a></span>). </p>
<p>In patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>, NUVIGIL should be administered at a reduced dose (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_clinical_pharmacology_id_002a70ca-43b7-4f7c-a41a-89cb00eaa121">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span>and<span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_precautions_id_e5720f17-4991-43a1-917f-909eb2493550">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>). </p>
<p>There is inadequate information to determine safety and efficacy of dosing in patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (See<span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_clinical_pharmacology_id_002a70ca-43b7-4f7c-a41a-89cb00eaa121">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span>and<span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_precautions_id_e5720f17-4991-43a1-917f-909eb2493550">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>). </p>
<p>In elderly patients, elimination of armodafinil and its metabolites may be reduced as a consequence of aging. Therefore, consideration should be given to the use of lower doses in this population (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_clinical_pharmacology_id_002a70ca-43b7-4f7c-a41a-89cb00eaa121">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span> and<span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_precautions_id_e5720f17-4991-43a1-917f-909eb2493550">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>). </p>

<p>If you have a severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> with NUVIGIL, stopping the medicine may not keep the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> from becoming life-threatening or causing you to be permanently disabled or disfigured.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">NUVIGIL is not approved for use in children for any medical condition.</span></p>
<p>It is not known if NUVIGIL is safe or if it works in children under the age of 17.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What is NUVIGIL?</span></p>

</ul>
<p>NUVIGIL will not cure these <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435524" conceptname="Sleep disorder">sleep disorders</span>.

<ul>
<li>are allergic to any of its ingredients.  See the end of this Medication Guide for a complete list of ingredients in NUVIGIL. </li>
<li>have had a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergic reaction</span> to either armodafinil (NUVIGIL) or modafinil (PROVIGIL<span class="Sup">®</span>).
