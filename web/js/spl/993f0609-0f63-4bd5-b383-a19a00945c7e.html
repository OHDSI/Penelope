<p class="First"><span class="Italics ParagraphCaption">Pharmacokinetics</span> - Following oral administration, griseofulvin is deposited in the keratin precursor cells and has a greater affinity for diseased tissue. The drug is tightly bound to the new keratin which becomes highly resistant to fungal invasions. The efficiency of gastrointestinal absorption of ultramicrocrystalline griseofulvin is approximately one and one-half times that of the conventional microsize griseofulvin. This factor permits the oral intake of two-thirds as much ultramicrocrystalline griseofulvin as the microsize form. However, there is currently no evidence that this lower dose confers any significant clinical differences with regard to safety and/or efficacy.</p>
<p>In a bioequivalence study conducted in healthy volunteers (N=24) in the fasted state, 250 mg ultramicrocrystalline griseofulvin tablets were compared with 250 mg ultramicrocrystalline griseofulvin tablets that were physically altered (crushed) and administered with applesauce. The 250 mg ultramicrocrystalline griseofulvin tablets were found to be bioequivalent to the physically altered (crushed) 250 mg ultramicrocrystalline griseofulvin tablets (See Table 1).</p>

<p><span class="Bold">Animal Toxicology</span><br>Chronic feeding of griseofulvin, at levels ranging from 0.5% to 2.5% of the diet resulted in the development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322895" conceptname="Nodule of liver">liver tumors</span> in several <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of mice, particularly in males. Smaller particle sizes result in an enhanced effect. Lower oral dosage levels have not been tested. Subcutaneous administration of relatively small doses of griseofulvin once a week during the first three weeks of life has also been reported to induce hepatomata in mice. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030041" conceptname="Thyroid nodule">Thyroid tumors</span>, mostly <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> but some carcinomas, have been reported in male rats receiving griseofulvin at levels of 2.0%, 1.0% and 0.2% of the diet, and in female rats receiving the two higher dose levels. Although studies in other animal species have not yielded evidence of tumorigenicity, these studies were not of adequate design to form a basis for conclusion in this regard. In subacute toxicity studies, orally administered griseofulvin produced hepatocellular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280654" conceptname="Necrosis">necrosis</span> in mice, but this has not been seen in other species. Disturbances in porphyrin metabolism have been reported in griseofulvin-treated laboratory animals. Griseofulvin has been reported to have colchicine-like effect on mitosis and cocarcinogenicity with methylcholanthrene in cutaneous tumor induction in laboratory animals.</p>

<p><span class="Italics">Animal Reproduction Studies</span> - It has been reported in the literature that griseofulvin was found to be embryotoxic and teratogenic on oral administration to pregnant rats. Pups with abnormalities have been reported in the litters of a few bitches treated with griseofulvin. Suppression of spermatogenesis has been reported to occur in rats, but investigation in man failed to confirm this.</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Patients on prolonged therapy with any potent medication should be under close observation. Periodic monitoring of organ system function, including renal, hepatic and hematopoietic, should be done. Since griseofulvin is derived from species of Penicillium, the possibility of cross-sensitivity with penicillin exists; however, known penicillin-sensitive patients have been treated without difficulty. Since a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4080920" conceptname="Phytophotodermatitis">photosensitivity reaction</span> is occasionally associated with griseofulvin therapy, patients should be warned to avoid exposure to intense natural or artificial sunlight. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255891" conceptname="Lupus erythematosus">Lupus erythematosus</span> or lupus-like syndromes have been reported in patients receiving griseofulvin. Griseofulvin decreases the activity of warfarin-type anticoagulants so that patients receiving these drugs concomitantly may require dosage adjustment of the anticoagulant during and after griseofulvin therapy. Barbiturates usually depress griseofulvin activity and concomitant administration may require a dosage adjustment of the antifungal agent. There have been reports in the literature of possible interactions between griseofulvin and oral contraceptives. The effect of alcohol may be potentiated by griseofulvin, producing such effects as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span> and flush.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">There have been post-marketing reports of severe skin and hepatic adverse events associated with griseofulvin use (see <a href="#L4e0a0739-ca3c-46ea-b662-e5ce459645ed">WARNINGS</a> section).</p>
<p>When adverse reactions occur, they are most commonly of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> type such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">skin rashes</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="139900" conceptname="Urticaria">urticaria</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="132702" conceptname="Erythema multiforme">erythema multiforme</span>-like drug reactions, and rarely, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432791" conceptname="Angioedema">angioneurotic edema</span>, and may necessitate withdrawal of therapy and appropriate countermeasures. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4193492" conceptname="Acroparesthesia">Paresthesia</span> of the hands and feet have been reported after extended therapy.

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Accurate diagnosis of infecting organism is essential. Identification should be made either by direct microscopic examination of a mounting of infected tissue in a solution of potassium hydroxide or by culture on an appropriate medium. Medication should be continued until the infecting organism is completely eradicated, as indicated by appropriate clinical or laboratory examination. Representative treatment periods are <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4182398" conceptname="Tinea capitis">tinea capitis</span>, 4 to 6 weeks; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135473" conceptname="Dermatophytosis">tinea</span> corporis, 2 to 4 weeks; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133141" conceptname="Tinea pedis">tinea pedis</span>, 4 to 8 weeks; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135473" conceptname="Dermatophytosis">tinea</span> unguium- depending on rate of growth-fingernails, at least 4 months; toenails, at least 6 months.</p>
<p>General measures in regard to hygiene should be observed to control sources of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> or reinfection. Concomitant use of appropriate topical agents is usually required, particularly in treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133141" conceptname="Tinea pedis">tinea pedis</span>. In some forms of athlete's foot, yeasts and bacteria may be involved as well as fungi. Griseofulvin will not eradicate the bacterial or monilial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>.<br>Ultramicrosize Griseofulvin Tablets may be swallowed whole or crushed and sprinkled onto 1 tablespoonful of applesauce and swallowed immediately without chewing.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Adults:</span> Daily administration of 375 mg (as a single dose or in divided doses) will give a satisfactory response in most patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135473" conceptname="Dermatophytosis">tinea</span> corporis, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4160328" conceptname="Tinea cruris">tinea cruris</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4182398" conceptname="Tinea capitis">tinea capitis</span>. For those <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432248" conceptname="Opportunistic mycosis">fungal infections</span> more difficult to eradicate, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133141" conceptname="Tinea pedis">tinea pedis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135473" conceptname="Dermatophytosis">tinea</span> unguium, a divided dose of 750 mg is recommended.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use:</span> Approximately 3.3 mg per pound of body weight per day of ultramicrosize griseofulvin is an effective dose for most pediatric patients. On this basis, the following dosage schedule is suggested: Children weighing 35 to 60 pounds -125 mg to 187.5 mg daily. Pediatric patients weighing over 60 pounds - 187.5 mg to 375 mg daily. Children and infants 2 years of age and younger - dosage has not been established.</p>
<p>Clinical experience with griseofulvin in children with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4182398" conceptname="Tinea capitis">tinea capitis</span> indicates that a single daily dose is effective. Clinical relapse will occur if the medication is not continued until the infecting organism is eradicated.</p>
