</div>
<p>Butorphanol tartrate is a white crystalline substance. The dose is expressed as the tartrate salt. One milligram of the salt is equivalent to 0.68 mg of the free base. The n-octanol/aqueous buffer partition coefficient of butorphanol is 180:1 at pH 7.5. </p>
<p>Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Solution, USP is an aqueous solution of butorphanol tartrate for administration as a metered spray to the nasal mucosa. Each mL contains 10 mg of butorphanol tartrate, 6.5 mg sodium chloride, 1 mg citric acid, 1.2 mg sodium hydroxide, 0.2 mg benzethonium chloride in purified water; pH adjusted to 5.0 with sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid, if necessary. The pump reservoir must be fully primed (see <a href="#i4i_patient_package_insert_id_aa615389-5c0d-4654-ac1b-5a23c62e3cae">PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS</a>) prior to initial use. After initial priming each metered spray delivers an average of 1 mg of butorphanol tartrate and the 2.5 mL bottle will deliver an average of 14 to 15 doses of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Solution. If not used for 48 hours or longer, the unit must be reprimed (see <a href="#i4i_patient_package_insert_id_aa615389-5c0d-4654-ac1b-5a23c62e3cae">PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS</a>). With intermittent use requiring repriming before each dose, the 2.5 mL bottle will deliver an average of 8 to 10 doses of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Solution depending on how much repriming is necessary.</p>

<h2>General Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Butorphanol is a mixed agonist-antagonist with low intrinsic activity at receptors of the µ-opioid type (morphine-like). It is also an agonist at κ-opioid receptors.</p>
<p>Its interactions with these receptors in the central nervous system apparently mediate most of its pharmacologic effects, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>.</p>
<p>In addition to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, CNS effects include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> of spontaneous respiratory activity and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span>, stimulation of the emetic center, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435279" conceptname="Tonic pupillary reaction">miosis</span>, and sedation. Effects possibly mediated by non-CNS mechanisms include alteration in cardiovascular resistance and capacitance, bronchomotor tone, gastrointestinal secretory and motor activity, and bladder sphincter activity.</p>
<p>In an animal model, the dose of butorphanol tartrate required to antagonize morphine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> by 50% was similar to that for nalorphine, less than that for pentazocine and more than that for naloxone.</p>
<p>The pharmacological activity of butorphanol metabolites has not been studied in humans; in animal studies, butorphanol metabolites have demonstrated some analgesic activity.</p>
<p>In human studies of butorphanol (see <a href="#i4i_section_id_61af1718-9eeb-4a35-8776-786a6a806cc9">Clinical Trials</a>), sedation is commonly noted at doses of 0.5 mg or more. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4229897" conceptname="Stupor">Narcosis</span> is produced by 10 to 12 mg doses of butorphanol administered over 10 to 15 minutes intravenously.</p>
<p>Butorphanol, like other mixed agonist-antagonists with a high affinity for the κ-receptor, may produce unpleasant psychotomimetic effects in some individuals.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">Nausea</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> may be produced by doses of 1 mg or more administered by any route.</p>
<p>In human studies involving individuals without significant respiratory dysfunction,2 mg of butorphanol IV and 10 mg of morphine sulfate IV depressed respiration to a comparable degree. At higher doses, the magnitude of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> with butorphanol is not appreciably increased; however, the duration of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> is longer. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">Respiratory depression</span> noted after administration of butorphanol to humans by any route is reversed by treatment with naloxone, a specific opioid antagonist (see <a href="#i4i_section_id_9bfcb1d3-54ab-41a2-b761-b557137a5184">OVERDOSAGE: Treatment</a>).</p>
<p>Butorphanol tartrate demonstrates antitussive effects in animals at doses less than those required for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>.</p>
<p>Hemodynamic changes noted during cardiac catheterization in patients receiving single 0.025 mg/kg intravenous doses of butorphanol have included increases in pulmonary artery pressure, wedge pressure and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span>, increases in left ventricular end diastolic pressure, and in systemic arterial pressure.</p>

<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span> of butorphanol is influenced by the route of administration. Onset of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> is within a few minutes for intravenous administration, within 15 minutes for intramuscular injection, and within 15 minutes for the nasal solution doses.</p>
<p>Peak analgesic activity occurs within 30 to 60 minutes following intravenous and intramuscular administration and within 1 to 2 hours following the nasal spray administration.</p>
<p>The duration of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> varies depending on the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> model as well as the route of administration, but is generally 3 to 4 hours with IM and IV doses as defined by the time 50% of patients required remedication. In postoperative studies, the duration of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> with IV or IM butorphanol was similar to morphine, meperidine, and pentazocine when administered in the same fashion at equipotent doses (see <a href="#i4i_section_id_61af1718-9eeb-4a35-8776-786a6a806cc9">Clinical Trials</a>). Compared to the injectable form and other drugs in this class, butorphanol tartrate nasal solution has a longer duration of action (4 to 5 hours) (see <a href="#i4i_section_id_61af1718-9eeb-4a35-8776-786a6a806cc9">Clinical Trials</a>).</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">After nasal administration, mean peak blood levels of 0.9 to 1.04 ng/mL occur at 30 to 60 minutes after a 1 mg dose (see <a href="#_Refid_766b6e1a-0d02-4eca-b1ed-3d4145919">Table 1</a>). The absolute bioavailability of butorphanol tartrate nasal solution is 60% to 70% and is unchanged in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="257007" conceptname="Allergic rhinitis">allergic rhinitis</span>. In patients using a nasal vasoconstrictor (oxymetazoline), the fraction of the dose absorbed was unchanged, but the rate of absorption was slowed. The peak plasma concentrations were approximately half those achieved in the absence of the vasoconstrictor.</p>
<p>Following its initial absorption/distribution phase, the single dose pharmacokinetics of butorphanol by the intravenous, intramuscular, and nasal routes of administration are similar (see Figure 1).</p>

</div>
<p>Serum protein binding is independent of concentration over the range achieved in clinical practice (up to 7 ng/mL) with a bound fraction of approximately 80%.</p>
<p>The volume of distribution of butorphanol varies from 305 to 901 liters and total body clearance from 52 to 154 liters/hour (see Table 1).</p>

<p>Dose proportionality for butorphanol tartrate nasal solution has been determined at steady state in doses up to 4 mg at 6 hour intervals. Steady state is achieved within 2 days. The mean peak plasma concentration at steady state was 1.8-fold (maximal 3-fold) following a single dose.</p>
<p>The drug is transported across the blood brain and placental barriers and into human milk (see <a href="#i4i_nursing_mothers_id_f18c5b0b-160f-4e02-95fb-6c9495ac32eb">PRECAUTIONS: Nursing Mothers</a>).</p>
<p>Butorphanol is extensively metabolized in the liver. Metabolism is qualitatively and quantitatively similar following intravenous, intramuscular, or nasal administration. Oral bioavailability is only 5 to 17% because of extensive first pass metabolism of butorphanol.</p>
<p>The major metabolite of butorphanol is hydroxybutorphanol, while norbutorphanol is produced in small amounts. Both have been detected in plasma following administration of butorphanol, with norbutorphanol present at trace levels at most time points. The elimination half-life of hydroxybutorphanol is about 18 hours and, as a consequence, considerable accumulation (~5-fold) occurs when butorphanol is dosed to steady state (1 mg transnasally q6h for 5 days).</p>
<p>Elimination occurs by urine and fecal excretion. When 3H-labelled butorphanol is administered to normal subjects, most (70 to 80%) of the dose is recovered in the urine, while approximately 15% is recovered in the feces.</p>
<p>About 5% of the dose is recovered in the urine as butorphanol. Forty-nine percent is eliminated in the urine as hydroxybutorphanol. Less than 5% is excreted in the urine as norbutorphanol.</p>
<p>Butorphanol pharmacokinetics in the elderly differ from younger patients (see <a href="#_Refid_766b6e1a-0d02-4eca-b1ed-3d4145919">Table 1</a>). The mean absolute bioavailability of butorphanol tartrate nasal solution in elderly women (48%) was less than that in elderly men (75%), young men (68%), or young women (70%). Elimination half-life is increased in the elderly (6.6 hours as opposed to 4.7 hours in younger subjects).</p>
<p>In renally impaired patients with creatinine clearances &lt; 30 mL/min, the elimination half-life was approximately doubled and the total body clearance was approximately one half (10.5 hours [clearance 150 L/h] compared to 5.8 hours [clearance 260 L/h] in healthy subjects). No effect on C<span class="Sub">max</span> or T<span class="Sub">max</span> was observed after a single dose.</p>
<p>After intravenous administration to patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>, the elimination half-life of butorphanol was approximately tripled and total body clearance was approximately one half (half-life 16.8 hours, clearance 92 L/h) compared to healthy subjects (half-life 4.8 hours, clearance 175 L/h). The exposure of hepatically impaired patients to butorphanol was significantly greater (about 2-fold) than that in healthy subjects.Similar results were seen after nasal administration. No effect on C<span class="Sub">max</span> or T<span class="Sub">max</span> was observed after a single intranasal dose.</p>

<p>The usual recommended dose for initial nasal administration is 1 mg (1 spray in <span class="Bold">one</span> nostril). If adequate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relief is not achieved within 60 to 90 minutes, an additional 1 mg dose may be given.</p>
<p>The initial dose sequence outlined above may be repeated in 3 to 4 hours as required <span class="Underline">after the second dose</span> of the sequence.</p>
<p>For the management of severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, an initial dose of 2 mg (1 spray in <span class="Bold">each </span>nostril) may be used in patients who will be able to remain recumbent in the event <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span> occurs.

<h2>Patients Dependent on Narcotics</h2>
<p class="First">Because of its opioid antagonist properties, butorphanol is not recommended for use in patients dependent on narcotics. Such patients should have an adequate period of withdrawal from opioid drugs prior to beginning butorphanol therapy. In patients taking opioid analgesics chronically, butorphanol has precipitated withdrawal symptoms such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4078201" conceptname="Mood swings">mood changes</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4148767" conceptname="Dysphoric mood">dysphoria</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">weakness</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>.</p>
<p>Because of the difficulty in assessing opioid tolerance in patients who have recently received repeated doses of narcotic analgesic medication, caution should be used in the administration of butorphanol to such patients.</p>

<h2>Use in Ambulatory Patients</h2>
<dl>
<dt>1.</dt>
<dd>Opioid analgesics, including butorphanol, impair the mental and physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery. Effects such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span> can appear, usually within the first hour after dosing. These effects may persist for varying periods of time after dosing. Patients who have taken butorphanol should not drive or operate dangerous machinery for at least 1 hour and until the effects of the drug are no longer present.</dd>
<dt>2.</dt>
<dd>Alcohol should not be consumed while using butorphanol. Concurrent use of butorphanol with drugs that affect the central nervous system (e.g., alcohol, barbiturates, tranquilizers, and antihistamines) may result in increased central nervous system depressant effects such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, and impaired mental function.</dd>
<dt>3.</dt>
<dd>Butorphanol is one of a class of drugs known to be abused and thus should be handled accordingly (see <a href="#i4i_abuse_dependence_id_0f7df0a2-9751-4bd4-8726-74eba49549f0">DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></a>).</dd>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Concurrent use of butorphanol with central nervous system depressants (e.g., alcohol, barbiturates, tranquilizers, and antihistamines) may result in increased central nervous system depressant effects. When used concurrently with such drugs, the dose of butorphanol should be the smallest effective dose and the frequency of dosing reduced as much as possible when administered concomitantly with drugs that potentiate the action of opioids.</p>
<p>In healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of a 1 mg dose of butorphanol administered as butorphanol tartrate nasal solution were not affected by the coadministration of a single 6 mg subcutaneous dose of sumatriptan. However, in another study in healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of butorphanol were significantly altered (29% decrease in AUC and 38% decrease in C<span class="Sub">max</span>) when a 1 mg dose of butorphanol tartrate nasal solution was administered 1 minute after a 20 mg dose of sumatriptan nasal solution. (The two drugs were administered in opposite nostrils.) When butorphanol tartrate nasal solution was administered 30 minutes after the sumatriptan nasal solution, the AUC of butorphanol increased 11% and C<span class="Sub">max</span> decreased 18%. In neither case were the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan affected by coadministration with butorphanol tartrate nasal solution. These results suggest that the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span> of butorphanol tartrate nasal solution may be diminished when it is administered shortly after sumatriptan nasal solution, but by 30 minutes any such reduction in effect should be minimal.</p>
<p>The safety of using butorphanol tartrate nasal solution and IMITREX® (sumatriptan) Nasal Spray during the same episode of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">migraine</span> has not been established. However, it should be noted that both products are capable of producing transient increases in blood pressure.</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of a 1 mg dose of butorphanol administered as butorphanol tartrate nasal solution were not affected by the coadministration of cimetidine (300 mg QID). Conversely, the administration of butorphanol tartrate nasal solution (1 mg butorphanol QID) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a 300 mg dose of cimetidine.</p>
<p>It is not known if the effects of butorphanol are altered by other concomitant medications that affect hepatic metabolism of drugs (erythromycin, theophylline, etc.), but physicians should be alert to the possibility that a smaller initial dose and longer intervals between doses may be needed.</p>
<p>The fraction of butorphanol tartrate nasal solution absorbed is unaffected by the concomitant administration of a nasal vasoconstrictor (oxymetazoline), but the rate of absorption is decreased. Therefore, a slower onset can be anticipated if butorphanol tartrate nasal solution is administered concomitantly with, or immediately following, a nasal vasoconstrictor.</p>
<p>No information is available about the use of butorphanol concurrently with MAO inhibitors.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category C</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">Reproduction studies in mice, rats, and rabbits during organogenesis did not reveal any teratogenic potential to butorphanol. However, pregnant rats treated subcutaneously with butorphanol at 1 mg/kg (5.9 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) had a higher frequency of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443213" conceptname="Stillbirth">stillbirths</span> than controls.

<p>Initially a 1 mg dose of butorphanol tartrate nasal solution should generally be used in geriatric patients and 90 to 120 minutes should elapse before administering a second 1 mg dose, if needed (see <a href="#i4i_section_id_addcb92b-2c7c-4664-bef1-1e00b26f9eab">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Individualization of Dosage</a>). </p>

<h2>Clinical Trial Experience</h2>
<p class="First">A total of 2446 patients were studied in premarketing clinical trials of butorphanol. Approximately half received butorphanol tartrate injection with the remainder receiving butorphanol tartrate nasal solution. In nearly all cases the type and incidence of side effects with butorphanol by any route were those commonly observed with opioid analgesics.</p>
<p>The adverse experiences described below are based on data from short-term and long-term clinical trials in patients receiving butorphanol by any route. There has been no attempt to correct for placebo effect or to subtract the frequencies reported by placebo-treated patients in controlled trials.</p>
<p>The most frequently reported adverse experiences across all clinical trials were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> (43%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span> (19%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> (13%).

<h2>Postmarketing Experience</h2>
<p class="First">Postmarketing experience with butorphanol tartrate nasal solution has shown an adverse event profile similar to that seen during the premarketing evaluation of butorphanol by all routes of administration. Adverse experiences that were associated with the use of butorphanol tartrate nasal solution and that are not listed above have been chosen for inclusion below because of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or probable relationship to butorphanol. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made.

<h1>DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></h1>
<p class="First">Butorphanol tartrate nasal solution is listed in Schedule IV of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).</p>
<p>Proper patient selection, dose and prescribing limitations, appropriate directions for use, and frequent monitoring are important to minimize the risk of abuse and physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> with butorphanol tartrate. Special care should be exercised in administering butorphanol to patients with a history of drug abuse or to patients receiving the drug on a continuous basis for an extended period.</p>

<h2>Clinical Trial Experience</h2>
<p class="First">In all clinical trials, less than 1% of patients using butorphanol tartrate nasal solution had experiences that suggested the development of physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> or tolerance. Much of this information is based on experience with patients who did not have prolonged continuous exposure to butorphanol tartrate nasal solution. However, in one controlled clinical trial where patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436096" conceptname="Chronic pain">chronic pain</span> from nonmalignant disease were treated with butorphanol tartrate nasal solution (n = 303) or placebo (n = 99) for up to 6 months, overuse (which may suggest the development of tolerance) was reported in nine (2.9%) patients receiving butorphanol tartrate nasal solution and no patients receiving placebo. Probable withdrawal symptoms were reported in eight (2.6%) patients using butorphanol tartrate nasal solution and no patients receiving placebo in the chronic nonmalignant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> study.

<h2>Clinical Manifestations</h2>
<p class="First">The clinical manifestations of butorphanol <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> are those of opioid drugs in general. Consequences of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> vary with the amount of butorphanol ingested and individual response to the effects of opiates. The most serious symptoms are <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312603" conceptname="Hypoventilation">hypoventilation</span>, cardiovascular insufficiency, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.

<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">Overdose</span> can occur due to accidental or intentional misuse of butorphanol, especially in young children who may gain access to the drug in the home.</p>

<h2>Treatment</h2>
<p class="First">The management of suspected butorphanol overdosage includes maintenance of adequate ventilation, peripheral perfusion, normal body temperature, and protection of the airway. Patients should be under continuous observation with adequate serial measures of mental state, responsiveness, and vital signs. Oxygen and ventilatory assistance should be available with continual monitoring by pulse oximetry if indicated. In the presence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>, placement of an artificial airway may be required. An adequate intravenous portal should be maintained to facilitate treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> associated with vasodilation. </p>
<p>The use of a specific opioid antagonist such as naloxone should be considered. As the duration of butorphanol action usually exceeds the duration of action of naloxone, repeated dosing with naloxone may be required.</p>
<p>In managing cases of suspected butorphanol overdosage, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should always be considered.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Factors to be considered in determining the dose are age, body weight, physical status, underlying pathological condition, use of other drugs, type of anesthesia to be used, and surgical procedure involved. Use in the elderly and in patients with hepatic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span> requires extra caution (see <a href="#i4i_precautions_id_a9da1d36-9d13-4935-8005-39a17660ffe2">PRECAUTIONS</a> and <a href="#i4i_section_id_addcb92b-2c7c-4664-bef1-1e00b26f9eab">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Individualization of Dosage</a>).

<h2>Use for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">Pain</span></h2>
<p class="First">The usual recommended dose for initial nasal administration of butorphanol tartrate nasal solution is 1 mg (1 spray in <span class="Bold">one </span>nostril). Adherence to this dose reduces the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>. If adequate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relief is not achieved within 60 to 90 minutes, an additional 1 mg dose may be given.</p>
<p>The initial dose sequence outlined above may be repeated in 3 to 4 hours as required after the second dose of the sequence.</p>
<p>Depending on the severity of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, an initial dose of 2 mg (1 spray in <span class="Bold">each </span>nostril) may be used in patients who will be able to remain recumbent in the event <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span> occurs.
