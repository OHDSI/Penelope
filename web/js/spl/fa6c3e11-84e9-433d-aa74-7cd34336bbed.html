<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">The active ingredient in colestipol tablets is colestipol hydrochloride, which is a lipid lowering agent for oral use. Colestipol is an insoluble, high molecular weight basic anion-exchange copolymer of diethylenetriamine and 1-chloro-2, 3-epoxypropane, with approximately 1 out of 5 amine nitrogens protonated (chloride form). It is a light yellow water-insoluble resin which is hygroscopic and swells when suspended in water or aqueous fluids.</p>
<p>Each colestipol tablet contains one gram of colestipol hydrochloride. Colestipol tablets are light yellow in color and are tasteless and odorless. The inactive ingredients are cellulose acetate phthalate, colloidal silicon dioxide, copovidone, dibutyl sebacate, hypromellose type 2910, microcrystalline cellulose and polyethylene glycol 6000.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">Cholesterol</span> is the major, and probably the sole precursor of bile acids. During normal digestion, bile acids are secreted via the bile from the liver and gall bladder into the intestines. Bile acids emulsify the fat and lipid materials present in food, thus facilitating absorption. A major portion of the bile acids secreted is reabsorbed from the intestines and returned via the portal circulation to the liver, thus completing the enterohepatic cycle. Only very small amounts of bile acids are found in normal serum.</p>
<p>Colestipol hydrochloride binds bile acids in the intestine forming a complex that is excreted in the feces. This nonsystemic action results in a partial removal of the bile acids from the enterohepatic circulation, preventing their reabsorption. Since colestipol hydrochloride is an anion exchange resin, the chloride anions of the resin can be replaced by other anions, usually those with a greater affinity for the resin than chloride ion.</p>
<p>Colestipol hydrochloride is hydrophilic, but it is virtually water insoluble (99.75%) and it is not hydrolyzed by digestive enzymes. The high molecular weight polymer in colestipol hydrochloride apparently is not absorbed. In humans, less than 0.17% of a single <span class="Sup">14</span>C-labeled colestipol hydrochloride dose is excreted in the urine when given following 60 days of chronic dosing of 20 grams of colestipol hydrochloride per day.</p>
<p>The increased fecal loss of bile acids due to colestipol hydrochloride administration leads to an increased oxidation of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> to bile acids. This results in an increase in the number of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, increased hepatic uptake of LDL and a decrease in beta lipoprotein or LDL serum levels, and a decrease in serum <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> levels. Although colestipol hydrochloride produces an increase in the hepatic synthesis of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> in man, serum <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> levels <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span>.</p>
<p>There is evidence to show that this <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> is secondary to an increased rate of clearance of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>-rich lipoproteins (beta or low density lipoproteins) from the plasma. Serum triglyceride levels may increase or remain unchanged in colestipol hydrochloride treated patients.</p>
<p>The decline in serum <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> levels with colestipol hydrochloride treatment is usually evident by one month. When colestipol hydrochloride is discontinued, serum <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> levels usually return to baseline levels within one month. Periodic determinations of serum <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> levels as outlined in the National <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">Cholesterol</span> Education Program (NCEP) guidelines should be done to confirm a favorable initial and long-term response<span class="Sup">1</span>.</p>
<p>In a large, placebo-controlled, multiclinic study, the LRC-CPPT<span class="Sup">2</span>, hypercholesterolemic subjects treated with cholestyramine, a bile-acid sequestrant with a mechanism of action and an effect on serum <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> similar to that of colestipol hydrochloride, had reductions in total and LDL-C. Over the 7-year study period the cholestyramine group experienced a 19% reduction (relative to the incidence in the placebo group) in the combined rate of coronary heart disease (CHD) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> plus nonfatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> (cumulative incidences of 7% cholestyramine and 8.6% placebo). The subjects included in the study were middle-aged men (age 35-59) with serum <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> levels above 265 mg/dL, LDL-C above 175 mg/dL on a moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>-lowering diet, and no history of heart disease. It is not clear to what extent these findings can be extrapolated to other segments of the hypercholesterolemic population not studied.</p>
<p>Treatment with colestipol hydrochloride results in a significant increase in lipoprotein LpAI. Lipoprotein LpAI is one of the two major lipoprotein particles within the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) density range<span class="Sup">3</span>, and has been shown in cell culture to promote <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> efflux or removal from cells<span class="Sup">4</span>. Although the significance of this finding has not been established in clinical studies, the elevation of the lipoprotein LpAI particle within the HDL fraction is consistent with an antiatherogenic effect of colestipol hydrochloride, even though little change is observed in HDL <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> (HDL-C).</p>
<p>In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134862" conceptname="Familial hypercholesterolemia">heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia</span> who have not obtained an optimal response to colestipol hydrochloride alone in maximal doses, the combination of colestipol hydrochloride and nicotinic acid has been shown to further lower serum <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>, triglyceride, and LDL <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> (LDL-C) values. Simultaneously, HDL-C values increased significantly. In many such patients it is possible to normalize serum lipid values.<span class="Sup">5-7</span></p>
<p>Preliminary evidence suggests that the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>-lowering effects of lovastatin and the bile acid sequestrant, colestipol hydrochloride, are additive.</p>
<p>The effect of intensive lipid-lowering therapy on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4194618" conceptname="Coronary artery atheroma">coronary atherosclerosis</span> has been assessed by arteriography in hyperlipidemic patients. In these randomized, controlled clinical trials, patients were treated for two to four years by either conventional measures (diet, placebo, or in some cases low-dose resin), or with intensive combination therapy using diet and colestipol hydrochloride granules plus either nicotinic acid or lovastatin. When compared to conventional measures, intensive lipid-lowering combination therapy significantly reduced the frequency of progression and increased the frequency of regression of coronary atherosclerotic lesions in patients with or at risk for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317576" conceptname="Coronary arteriosclerosis">coronary artery disease</span>.<span class="Sup">8-11</span></p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Since no drug is innocuous, strict attention should be paid to the indications and contraindications, particularly when selecting drugs for chronic long-term use.</p>
<p>Colestipol tablets are indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for the reduction of elevated serum total and LDL-C in patients with primary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437827" conceptname="Pure hypercholesterolemia">hypercholesterolemia</span> (elevated LDL-C) who do not respond adequately to diet. Generally, colestipol tablets have no clinically significant effect on serum triglycerides, but with their use, triglyceride levels may be raised in some patients.</p>
<p>Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be a component of multiple risk factor intervention in those individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437827" conceptname="Pure hypercholesterolemia">hypercholesterolemia</span>. Treatment should begin and continue with dietary therapy (see <a href="#NCEP">NCEP guidelines</a>). A minimum of six months of intensive dietary therapy and counseling should be carried out prior to initiation of drug therapy. Shorter periods may be considered in patients with severe elevations of LDL-C or with definite CHD.</p>
<p>According to the NCEP guidelines, the goal of treatment is to lower LDL-C, and LDL-C is to be used to initiate and assess treatment response. Only if LDL-C levels are not available, should the Total-C be used to monitor therapy. The NCEP treatment guidelines are shown below.</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Prior to initiating therapy with colestipol tablets, secondary causes of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437827" conceptname="Pure hypercholesterolemia">hypercholesterolemia</span> (e.g., poorly controlled <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140673" conceptname="Hypothyroidism">hypothyroidism</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="195314" conceptname="Nephrotic syndrome">nephrotic syndrome</span>, dysproteinemias, obstructive liver disease, other drug therapy, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218106" conceptname="Alcoholism">alcoholism</span>), should be excluded, and a lipid profile performed to assess total <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>, HDL-C, and triglycerides (TG). For individuals with TG less than 400 mg/dL (&lt;4.5 mmol/L), LDL-C can be estimated using the following equation:</p>
<p>LDL-C = Total <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> - [ (Triglycerides / 5)+HDL-C]</p>
<p>For TG levels &gt;400 mg/dL, this equation is less accurate and LDL-C concentrations should be determined by ultracentrifugation. In hypertriglyceridemic patients, LDL-C may be low or normal despite elevated Total-C. In such cases colestipol tablets may not be indicated.</p>
<p>Because it sequesters bile acids, colestipol hydrochloride may interfere with normal fat absorption and, thus, may reduce absorption of folic acid and fat soluble vitamins such as A, D, and K.</p>
<p>Chronic use of colestipol hydrochloride may be associated with an increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432585" conceptname="Blood coagulation disorder">bleeding tendency</span> due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4253058" conceptname="Factor II deficiency">hypoprothrombinemia</span> from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435781" conceptname="Vitamin K deficiency">vitamin K deficiency</span>. This will usually respond promptly to parenteral vitamin K<span class="Sub">1</span> and recurrences can be prevented by oral administration of vitamin K<span class="Sub">1</span>.</p>
<p>Serum <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> and triglyceride levels should be determined periodically based on NCEP guidelines to confirm a favorable initial and adequate long-term response.</p>
<p>Colestipol tablets may produce or severely worsen pre-existing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">constipation</span>. The dosage should be increased gradually in patients to minimize the risk of developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4258683" conceptname="Fecal impaction">fecal impaction</span>. In patients with pre-existing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">constipation</span>, the starting dose should be 2 grams once or twice a day. Increased fluid and fiber intake should be encouraged to alleviate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">constipation</span> and a stool softener may occasionally be indicated. If the initial dose is well tolerated, the dose may be increased by a further 2 to 4 grams/day (at monthly intervals) with periodic monitoring of serum lipoproteins. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">constipation</span> worsens or the desired therapeutic response is not achieved at 2 to 16 grams/day, combination therapy or alternate therapy should be considered. Particular effort should be made to avoid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">constipation</span> in patients with symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317576" conceptname="Coronary arteriosclerosis">coronary artery disease</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">Constipation</span> associated with colestipol tablets may aggravate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194382" conceptname="External hemorrhoids">hemorrhoids</span>.</p>
<p>While there have been no reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140673" conceptname="Hypothyroidism">hypothyroidism</span> induced in individuals with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4193309" conceptname="Thyroid function tests normal">normal thyroid function</span>, the theoretical possibility exists, particularly in patients with limited thyroid reserve.</p>
<p>Since colestipol hydrochloride is a chloride form of an anion exchange resin, there is a possibility that prolonged use may lead to the development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4108257" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis, NAG, acidifying salts">hyperchloremic acidosis</span>.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis and impairment of fertility</h2>
<p class="First">In studies conducted in rats in which cholestyramine resin (a bile acid sequestering agent similar to colestipol hydrochloride) was used as a tool to investigate the role of various intestinal factors, such as fat, bile salts and microbial flora, in the development of intestinal tumors induced by potent carcinogens, the incidence of such tumors was observed to be greater in cholestyramine resin treated rats than in control rats.</p>
<p>The relevance of this laboratory observation from studies in rats with cholestyramine resin to the clinical use of colestipol tablets is not known. In the LRC-CPPT study referred to above, the total incidence of fatal and non-fatal neoplasms was similar in both treatment groups. When the many different categories of tumors are examined, various alimentary system cancers were somewhat more prevalent in the cholestyramine group. The small numbers and the multiple categories prevent conclusions from being drawn. Further follow-up of the LRC-CPPT participants by the sponsors of that study is planned for cause-specific mortality and cancer morbidity. When colestipol hydrochloride was administered in the diet to rats for 18 months, there was no evidence of any drug related intestinal tumor formation. In the Ames assay, colestipol hydrochloride was not mutagenic.</p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42228-7">
<a name="section-6.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Use in Pregnancy</h2>
<p class="First">Since colestipol hydrochloride is essentially not absorbed systemically (less than 0.17% of the dose), it is not expected to cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy in recommended dosages. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women, and the known interference with absorption of fat soluble vitamins may be detrimental even in the presence of supplementation.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34080-2">
<a name="section-6.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Caution should be exercised when colestipol tablets are administered to a nursing mother. The possible lack of proper vitamin absorption described in the "pregnancy" section may have an effect on nursing infants.</p>

<a name="section-6.5"></a><p></p>
<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Colestipol tablets may be larger than pills you have taken before. If you have had swallowing problems or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4096712" conceptname="Choking">choking</span> with food, liquids or other tablets or capsules in the past, you should discuss this with your doctor before taking colestipol tablets.</p>
<p>It is important that you take colestipol tablets correctly:</p>
<ol>
<li>Always take one tablet at a time and swallow promptly.</li>
<li>Swallow each tablet whole. Do not cut, crush, or chew the tablets.</li>
<li>Colestipol tablets must be taken with water or another liquid that you prefer. Swallowing the tablets will be easier if you drink plenty of liquid as you swallow each tablet.</li>
</ol>
<p>Difficulty swallowing and temporary obstruction of the esophagus (the tube between your mouth and stomach) have been rarely reported in patients taking colestipol tablets. If a tablet does get stuck after you swallow it, you may notice pressure or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090431" conceptname="Discomfort">discomfort</span>. If this happens to you, you should contact your doctor. Do not take colestipol tablets again without your doctor's advice.</p>
<p>If you are taking other medications, you should take them at least one hour before or four hours after taking colestipol tablets.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34073-7">
<a name="DI"></a><a name="section-6.6"></a><p></p>
<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Since colestipol hydrochloride is an anion exchange resin, it may have a strong affinity for anions other than the bile acids. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies have indicated that colestipol hydrochloride binds a number of drugs. Therefore, colestipol tablets may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication. The interval between the administration of colestipol tablets and any other medication should be as long as possible. Patients should take other drugs at least one hour before or four hours after colestipol tablets to avoid impeding their absorption.</p>
<p>Repeated doses of colestipol hydrochloride given prior to a single dose of propranolol in human trials have been reported to decrease propranolol absorption. However, in a follow-up study in normal subjects, single dose administration of colestipol hydrochloride and propranolol and twice-a-day administration for 5 days of both agents did not effect the extent of propranolol absorption, but had a small yet statistically significant effect on its rate of absorption; the time to reach maximum concentration was delayed 30 minutes. Effects on the absorption of other beta-blockers have not been determined. Therefore, patients on propranolol should be observed when colestipol tablets are either added or deleted from a therapeutic regimen.</p>
<p>Studies in humans show that the absorption of chlorothiazide as reflected in urinary excretion is markedly decreased even when administered one hour before colestipol hydrochloride. The absorption of tetracycline, furosemide, penicillin G, hydrochlorothiazide, and gemfibrozil was significantly decreased when given simultaneously with colestipol hydrochloride; these drugs were not tested to determine the effect of administration one hour before colestipol hydrochloride.</p>
<p>No depressant effect on blood levels in humans was noted when colestipol hydrochloride was administered with any of the following drugs: aspirin, clindamycin, clofibrate, methyldopa, nicotinic acid (niacin), tolbutamide, phenytoin or warfarin. Particular caution should be observed with digitalis preparations since there are conflicting results for the effect of colestipol hydrochloride on the availability of digoxin and digitoxin. The potential for binding of these drugs if given concomitantly is present. Discontinuing colestipol hydrochloride could pose a hazard to health if a potentially toxic drug that is significantly bound to the resin has been titrated to a maintenance level while the patient was taking colestipol hydrochloride.</p>
<p>Bile acid binding resins may also interfere with the absorption of oral phosphate supplements and hydrocortisone.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-7.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Gastrointestinal</h2>
<p class="First">The most common adverse reactions are confined to the gastrointestinal tract. To achieve minimal GI disturbance with an optimal LDL-C lowering effect, a gradual increase of dosage starting with one dose/day is recommended. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">Constipation</span> is the major single complaint and at times is severe. Most instances of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">constipation</span> are mild, transient, and controlled with standard treatment.

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Overdosage of colestipol tablets has not been reported. Should overdosage occur, however, the chief potential harm would be obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract. The location of such potential obstruction, the degree of obstruction and the presence or absence of normal gut motility would determine treatment.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34068-7">
<a name="section-9"></a><p></p>
<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">For adults, colestipol tablets are recommended in doses of 2 to 16 grams/day given once or in divided doses. The starting dose should be 2 grams once or twice daily. Dosage increases of 2 grams, once or twice daily should occur at 1- or 2-month intervals. Appropriate use of lipid profiles as per NCEP guidelines including LDL-C and triglycerides, is advised so that optimal but not excessive doses are used to obtain the desired therapeutic effect on LDL-C level. If the desired therapeutic effect is not obtained at 2 to 16 grams/day with good compliance and acceptable side effects, combined therapy or alternate treatment should be considered.</p>
<p>Colestipol tablets must be taken one at a time and be promptly swallowed whole, using plenty of water or other appropriate liquid. Do not cut, crush, or chew the tablets. Patients should take other drugs at least one hour before or four hours after colestipol tablets to minimize possible interference with their absorption. (See <a href="#DI">DRUG INTERACTIONS</a>.)</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-9.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Before Administration of Colestipol Tablets</h2>
<ol>
<li>Define the type of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432867" conceptname="Hyperlipidemia">hyperlipoproteinemia</span>, as described in NCEP guidelines.</li>
<li>Institute a trial of diet and weight reduction.</li>
<li>Establish baseline serum total and LDL-C and triglyceride levels.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-9.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>During Administration of Colestipol Tablets</h2>
<ol>
<li>The patient should be carefully monitored clinically, including serum <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> and triglyceride levels. Periodic determinations of serum <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> levels as outlined in the NCEP guidelines should be done to confirm a favorable initial and long-term response.</li>
<li>Failure of total or LDL-C to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> within the desired range should lead one to first examine dietary and drug compliance. If these are deemed acceptable, combined therapy or alternate treatment should be considered.</li>
<li>Significant rise in triglyceride level should be considered as indication for dose reduction, drug discontinuation, or combined or alternate therapy.</li>
