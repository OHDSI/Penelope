<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Celexa® (citalopram HBr) is an orally administered selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with a chemical structure unrelated to that 
of other SSRIs or of tricyclic, tetracyclic, or other available antidepressant 
agents. Citalopram HBr is a racemic bicyclic phthalane derivative designated 
(±)-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile, 
HBr with the following structural formula:</p>
<p><img alt="image of chemical structure" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=6c96373f-6744-49d4-aec5-3720bc993fab&amp;name=chemical%20structure.jpg"></p>
<p>The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">20</span>H<span class="Sub">22</span>BrFN<span class="Sub">2</span>O and its molecular weight is 
405.35.</p>
<p>Citalopram HBr occurs as a fine, white to off-white powder. Citalopram HBr is 
sparingly soluble in water and soluble in ethanol.</p>
<p>Celexa (citalopram hydrobromide) is available as tablets or as an oral 
solution.</p>
<p>Celexa 10 mg tablets are film-coated, oval tablets containing citalopram HBr 
in strengths equivalent to 10 mg citalopram base. Celexa 20 mg and 40 mg tablets 
are film-coated, oval, scored tablets containing citalopram HBr in strengths 
equivalent to 20 mg or 40 mg citalopram base. The tablets also contain the 
following inactive ingredients: copolyvidone, corn starch, crosscarmellose 
sodium, glycerin, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, 
microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, and titanium dioxide. Iron 
oxides are used as coloring agents in the beige (10 mg) and pink (20 mg) 
tablets.</p>
<p>Celexa oral solution contains citalopram HBr equivalent to 2 mg/mL citalopram 
base. It also contains the following inactive ingredients: sorbitol, purified 
water, propylene glycol, methylparaben, natural peppermint flavor, and 
propylparaben.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<a href="http://"></a>Pharmacodynamics<p class="First">The mechanism of action of citalopram HBr as an antidepressant is 
presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central 
nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of 
serotonin (5-HT). <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in 
vivo</span> studies in animals suggest that citalopram is a highly selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with minimal effects on norepinephrine (NE) 
and dopamine (DA) neuronal reuptake. Tolerance to the inhibition of 5-HT uptake 
is not induced by long-term (14-day) treatment of rats with citalopram. 
Citalopram is a racemic mixture (50/50), and the inhibition of 5-HT reuptake by 
citalopram is primarily due to the (S)-enantiomer.</p>
<p>Citalopram has no or very low affinity for 5-HT<span class="Sub">1A</span>, 
5-HT<span class="Sub">2A</span>, dopamine D<span class="Sub">1</span> and D<span class="Sub">2</span>, α<span class="Sub">1</span>-, α<span class="Sub">2</span>-, and 
β-adrenergic, histamine H<span class="Sub">1</span>, gamma aminobutyric acid 
(GABA), muscarinic cholinergic, and benzodiazepine receptors. Antagonism of 
muscarinic, histaminergic, and adrenergic receptors has been hypothesized to be 
associated with various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular effects of 
other psychotropic drugs.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pharmacokinetics<p>The single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of citalopram are 
linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10-60 mg/day. Biotransformation 
of citalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 35 
hours. With once daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved 
within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of 
citalopram in plasma, based on the half-life, is expected to be 2.5 times the 
plasma concentrations observed after a single dose. The tablet and oral solution 
dosage forms of citalopram HBr are bioequivalent.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Absorption and Distribution<p>Following a single oral dose (40 mg tablet) of citalopram, peak 
blood levels occur at about 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of citalopram 
was about 80% relative to an intravenous dose, and absorption is not affected by 
food. The volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg and the binding 
of citalopram (CT), demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT) to 
human plasma proteins is about 80%.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Metabolism and Elimination<p>Following intravenous administrations of citalopram, the fraction 
of drug recovered in the urine as citalopram and DCT was about 10% and 5%, 
respectively. The systemic clearance of citalopram was 330 mL/min, with 
approximately 20% of that due to renal clearance.</p>
<p>Citalopram is metabolized to demethylcitalopram (DCT), didemethylcitalopram 
(DDCT), citalopram-N-oxide, and a deaminated propionic acid derivative. In 
humans, unchanged citalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. At steady 
state, the concentrations of citalopram's metabolites, DCT and DDCT, in plasma 
are approximately one-half and one-tenth, respectively, that of the parent drug. 
<span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies show that citalopram is at least 8 
times more potent than its metabolites in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, 
suggesting that the metabolites evaluated do not likely contribute significantly 
to the antidepressant actions of citalopram.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies using human liver microsomes 
indicated that CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary isozymes involved in the 
N-demethylation of citalopram.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Population Subgroups<p>Age - Citalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects ≥ 60 years of age 
were compared to younger subjects in two normal volunteer studies. In a 
single-dose study, citalopram AUC and half-life were increased in the elderly 
subjects by 30% and 50%, respectively, whereas in a multiple-dose study they 
were increased by 23% and 30%, respectively. 20 mg is the recommended dose for 
most elderly patients (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s95">DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>
<p>Gender - In three pharmacokinetic studies (total N=32), citalopram AUC in 
women was one and a half to two times that in men. This difference was not 
observed in five other pharmacokinetic studies (total N=114). In clinical 
studies, no differences in steady state serum citalopram levels were seen 
between men (N=237) and women (N=388). There were no gender differences in the 
pharmacokinetics of DCT and DDCT. No adjustment of dosage on the basis of gender 
is recommended.</p>
<p>Reduced hepatic function - Citalopram oral clearance was reduced by 37% and 
half-life was doubled in patients with reduced hepatic function compared to 
normal subjects. 20 mg is the recommended dose for most hepatically impaired 
patients (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s95">DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>
<p>Reduced renal function - In patients with mild to moderate renal function 
impairment, oral clearance of citalopram was reduced by 17% compared to normal 
subjects. No adjustment of dosage for such patients is recommended. No 
information is available about the pharmacokinetics of citalopram in patients 
with severely reduced renal function (creatinine clearance &lt; 20 
mL/min).</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Drug-Drug Interactions<p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> enzyme inhibition data did 
not reveal an inhibitory effect of citalopram on CYP3A4, -2C9, or -2E1, but did 
suggest that it is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, -2D6, and -2C19. Citalopram would 
be expected to have little inhibitory effect on <span class="Italics">in 
vivo</span> metabolism mediated by these cytochromes. However, <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> data to address this question are limited.</p>
<p>Since CYP3A4 and 2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of 
citalopram, it is expected that potent inhibitors of 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, and macrolide antibiotics) and potent inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., 
omeprazole) might decrease the clearance of citalopram. However, 
coadministration of citalopram and the potent 3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not 
significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. Because citalopram is 
metabolized by multiple enzyme systems, inhibition of a single enzyme may not 
appreciably decrease citalopram clearance. Citalopram steady state levels were 
not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive 2D6 metabolizers 
after multiple-dose administration of Celexa, suggesting that coadministration, 
with Celexa, of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6, is unlikely to have clinically 
significant effects on citalopram metabolism. See <span class="Bold"><a href="#s32">Drug Interactions</a></span> under <span class="Bold"><a href="#s21">PRECAUTIONS</a></span> for more detailed information on available 
drug interaction data.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Clinical Efficacy Trials<p>The efficacy of Celexa as a treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> was 
established in two placebo-controlled studies (of 4 to 6 weeks in duration) in 
adult outpatients (ages 18-66) meeting DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria for major 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>. Study 1, a 6-week trial in which patients received fixed Celexa 
doses of 10, 20, 40, and 60 mg/day, showed that Celexa at doses of 40 and 60 
mg/day was effective as measured by the Hamilton <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> Rating Scale (HAMD) 
total score, the HAMD <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="40546087" conceptname="Depressed mood">depressed mood</span> item (Item 1), the Montgomery Asberg 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> Rating Scale, and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Severity 
scale. This study showed no clear effect of the 10 and 20 mg/day doses, and the 
60 mg/day dose was not more effective than the 40 mg/day dose. In study 2, a 
4-week, placebo-controlled trial in depressed patients, of whom 85% met criteria 
for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440383" conceptname="Depressive disorder">melancholia</span>, the initial dose was 20 mg/day, followed by titration to the 
maximum tolerated dose or a maximum dose of 80 mg/day. Patients treated with 
Celexa showed significantly greater improvement than placebo patients on the 
HAMD total score, HAMD item 1, and the CGI Severity score. In three additional 
placebo-controlled <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> trials, the difference in response to treatment 
between patients receiving Celexa and patients receiving placebo was not 
statistically significant, possibly due to high spontaneous response rate, 
smaller sample size, or, in the case of one study, too low a dose.</p>
<p>In two long-term studies, depressed patients who had responded to Celexa 
during an initial 6 or 8 weeks of acute treatment (fixed doses of 20 or 40 
mg/day in one study and flexible doses of 20-60 mg/day in the second study) were 
randomized to continuation of Celexa or to placebo. In both studies, patients 
receiving continued Celexa treatment experienced significantly lower relapse 
rates over the subsequent 6 months compared to those receiving placebo. In the 
fixed-dose study, the decreased rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> relapse was similar in 
patients receiving 20 or 40 mg/day of Celexa.</p>
<p>Analyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and 
race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these 
patient characteristics.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Comparison of Clinical Trial Results<p>Highly variable results have been seen in the clinical 
development of all antidepressant drugs. Furthermore, in those circumstances 
when the drugs have not been studied in the same controlled clinical trial(s), 
comparisons among the results of studies evaluating the effectiveness of 
different antidepressant drug products are inherently unreliable. Because 
conditions of testing (e.g., patient samples, investigators, doses of the 
treatments administered and compared, outcome measures, etc.) vary among trials, 
it is virtually impossible to distinguish a difference in drug effect from a 
difference due to one of the confounding factors just enumerated.</p>

<p>The efficacy of Celexa in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> was established in 4-6 
week, controlled trials of outpatients whose diagnosis corresponded most closely

<p>The efficacy of Celexa in maintaining an antidepressant response for up to 24 
weeks following 6 to 8 weeks of acute treatment was demonstrated in two 
placebo-controlled trials (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s4">CLINICAL 
PHARMACOLOGY</a></span>). Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use Celexa 
for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of 
the drug for the individual patient.</p>

<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders 
themselves are the strongest predictors of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>. There has been a 
long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing

during the early phases of treatment.</p>
<p>Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant 
drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal 
thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults 
(ages 18-24) with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD) and other psychiatric 
disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of 
suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; 
there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 
and older. </p>
<p>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents 
with MDD, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440374" conceptname="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">obsessive compulsive disorder</span> (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders 
included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 
patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or 
other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median 
duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There 
was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency 
toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There 
were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different 
indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. 
placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across 
indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of 
cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in <span class="Bold"><a href="#t1">Table 1</a>.</span></p>

have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms.</p>
<p>Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment 
with Celexa. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is 
recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a 
decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the 
previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may 
continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s95">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>

small proportion of patients with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="444100" conceptname="Mood disorder">affective disorders</span> treated with other 
marketed antidepressants. As with all antidepressants, Celexa should be used 
cautiously in patients with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">mania</span>.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">Seizures</span><p>Although anticonvulsant effects of citalopram have been observed 
in animal studies, Celexa has not been systematically evaluated in patients with 
a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> disorder. These patients were excluded from clinical studies during 
the product's premarketing testing. In clinical trials of Celexa, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> 
occurred in 0.3% of patients treated with Celexa (a rate of one patient per 98 
years of exposure) and 0.5% of patients treated with placebo (a rate of one 
patient per 50 years of exposure). Like other antidepressants, Celexa should be 
introduced with care in patients with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> disorder.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Interference with Cognitive and Motor 
Performance<p>In studies in normal volunteers, Celexa in doses of 40 mg/day did 
not produce impairment of intellectual function or psychomotor performance. 
Because any psychoactive drug may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, 
however, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, 
including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that Celexa therapy 
does not affect their ability to engage in such activities.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness<p>Clinical experience with Celexa in patients with certain 
concomitant systemic illnesses is limited. Caution is advisable in using Celexa 
in patients with diseases or conditions that produce altered metabolism or 
hemodynamic responses.</p>
<p>Celexa has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a recent 
history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> or unstable heart disease. Patients with these 
diagnoses were generally excluded from clinical studies during the product's 
premarketing testing. However, the electrocardiograms of 1116 patients who 
received Celexa in clinical trials were evaluated and the data indicate that 
Celexa is not associated with the development of clinically significant ECG 
abnormalities.</p>
<p>In subjects with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>, citalopram clearance was decreased and 
plasma concentrations were increased. The use of Celexa in hepatically impaired 
patients should be approached with caution and a lower maximum dosage is 
recommended (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s95">DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>
<p>Because citalopram is extensively metabolized, excretion of unchanged drug in 
urine is a minor route of elimination. Until adequate numbers of patients with 
severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> have been evaluated during chronic treatment with 
Celexa, however, it should be used with caution in such patients (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s95">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Information for Patients<p>Physicians are advised to discuss the following issues with 
patients for whom they prescribe Celexa.</p>
<p>Patients should be cautioned about the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span> with the 
concomitant use of <span class="Bold">Celexa</span> and triptans, tramadol or 
other serotonergic agents.</p>
<p>Although in controlled studies Celexa has not been shown to impair 
psychomotor performance, any psychoactive drug may impair judgment, thinking, or 
motor skills, so patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous 
machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that Celexa 
therapy does not affect their ability to engage in such activities.</p>
<p>Patients should be told that, although Celexa has not been shown in 
experiments with normal subjects to increase the mental and motor skill 
impairments caused by alcohol, the concomitant use of Celexa and alcohol in 
depressed patients is not advised.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised to inform their physician if they are taking, or 
plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, as there is a 
potential for interactions.</p>
<p>Patients should be cautioned about the concomitant use of Celexa and NSAIDs, 
aspirin, warfarin, or other drugs that affect coagulation since combined use of 
psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and these agents has 
been associated with an increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant 
or intend to become pregnant during therapy.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they are 
breastfeeding an infant.</p>
<p>While patients may notice improvement with Celexa therapy in 1 to 4 weeks, 
they should be advised to continue therapy as directed.</p>
<p>Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their 
families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with 
treatment with Celexa and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient 
Medication Guide about “Antidepressant Medicines, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> and other Serious 
Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions? is available for Celexa. The 
prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and 
their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in 
understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss 
the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they 
may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p>CNS Drugs - Given the primary CNS effects of citalopram, caution 
should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting 
drugs.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p>Alcohol - Although citalopram did not potentiate the cognitive

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p>Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (NSAIDs, Aspirin, Warfarin,

with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">gastrointestinal bleeding</span>. 
These studies have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may

<p>Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, have been 
reported when SSRIs and SNRIs are coadministered with warfarin. Patients 
receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when Lexapro is

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p>Cimetidine - In subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day 
Celexa, combined administration of 400 mg/day cimetidine for 8 days resulted in 
an increase in citalopram AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of 43% and 39%, 
respectively. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p>Digoxin - In subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day 
Celexa, combined administration of Celexa and digoxin (single dose of 1 mg) did 
not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p>Lithium - Coadministration of Celexa (40 mg/day for 10 days) and 
lithium (30 mmol/day for 5 days) had no significant effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of citalopram or lithium. Nevertheless, plasma lithium levels 
should be monitored with appropriate adjustment to the lithium dose in 
accordance with standard clinical practice. Because lithium may enhance the 
serotonergic effects of citalopram, caution should be exercised when Celexa and 
lithium are coadministered.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p>Pimozide - In a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg 
co-administered with citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was 
associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared 
to pimozide given alone. Citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or C<span class="Sub">max</span> of pimozide. The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic 
interaction is not known.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p>Theophylline - Combined administration of Celexa (40 mg/day for 
21 days) and the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline (single dose of 300 mg) did not

clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p>Warfarin - Administration of 40 mg/day Celexa for 21 days did not 
affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, a CYP3A4 substrate. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">Prothrombin</span> time

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p>Carbamazepine - Combined administration of Celexa (40 mg/day for 
14 days) and carbamazepine (titrated to 400 mg/day for 35 days) did not 
significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 substrate. 
Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the 
enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that carbamazepine 
might increase the clearance of citalopram should be considered if the two drugs 
are coadministered.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p>Triazolam - Combined administration of Celexa (titrated to 40 
mg/day for 28 days) and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam (single dose of 0.25 mg) 
did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or 
triazolam.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p>Ketoconazole - Combined administration of Celexa (40 mg) and 
ketoconazole (200 mg) decreased the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of 
ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the 
pharmacokinetics of citalopram.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p>CYP3A4 and 2C19 Inhibitors - <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> 
studies indicated that CYP3A4 and 2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the 
metabolism of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram (40 mg) and 
ketoconazole (200 mg), a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, did not significantly 
affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. Because citalopram is metabolized by 
multiple enzyme systems, inhibition of a single enzyme may not appreciably 
decrease citalopram clearance.</p>
<p>Metoprolol - Administration of 40 mg/day Celexa for 22 days resulted in a 
two-fold increase in the plasma levels of the beta-adrenergic blocker 
metoprolol. Increased metoprolol plasma levels have been associated with 
decreased cardioselectivity. Coadministration of Celexa and metoprolol had no 
clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p>Imipramine and Other Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) - <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies suggest that citalopram is a relatively 
weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of Celexa (40 mg/day for 10 days) 
with the TCA imipramine (single dose of 100 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, did not 
significantly affect the plasma concentrations of imipramine or citalopram. 
However, the concentration of the imipramine metabolite desipramine was 
increased by approximately 50%. The clinical significance of the desipramine 
change is unknown. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the coadministration of 
TCAs with Celexa.</p>

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Impairment of Fertility<p>When citalopram was administered orally to 16 male and 24 female 
rats prior to and throughout mating and gestation at doses of 32, 48, and 72 
mg/kg/day, mating was decreased at all doses, and fertility was decreased at 
doses ≥ 32 mg/kg/day, approximately 5 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day on a body 
surface area (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) basis. Gestation duration was 
increased at 48 mg/kg/day, approximately 8 times the MRHD.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pregnancy<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pregnancy Category C<p>In animal reproduction studies, citalopram has been shown to have 
adverse effects on embryo/fetal and postnatal development, including teratogenic 
effects, when administered at doses greater than human therapeutic doses.</p>
<p>In two rat embryo/fetal development studies, oral administration of 
citalopram (32, 56, or 112 mg/kg/day) to pregnant animals during the period of 
organogenesis resulted in decreased embryo/fetal growth and survival and an 
increased incidence of fetal abnormalities (including cardiovascular and 
skeletal defects) at the high dose, which is approximately 18 times the MRHD of 
60 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) basis. This dose 
was also associated with maternal toxicity (clinical signs, decreased body 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span>). The developmental, no-effect dose of 56 mg/kg/day is approximately 
9 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. In a rabbit study, no 
adverse effects on embryo/fetal development were observed at doses of up to 16 
mg/kg/day, or approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> 
basis. Thus, teratogenic effects were observed at a maternally toxic dose in the 
rat and were not observed in the rabbit.</p>
<p>When female rats were treated with citalopram (4.8, 12.8, or 32 mg/kg/day) 
from late gestation through weaning, increased offspring mortality during the 
first 4 days after birth and persistent offspring <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245750" conceptname="Growth retardation">growth retardation</span> were 
observed at the highest dose, which is approximately 5 times the MRHD on a 
mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. The no-effect dose of 12.8 mg/kg/day is 
approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. Similar 
effects on offspring mortality and growth were seen when dams were treated 
throughout gestation and early lactation at doses ≥ 24 mg/kg/day, approximately 
4 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. A no-effect dose was 
not determined in that study.</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; 
therefore, citalopram should be used during pregnancy only if the potential 
benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pregnancy-Nonteratogenic Effects<p>Neonates exposed to Celexa and other SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the

1000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial 
neonatal morbidity and mortality. In a retrospective, case-control study of 377 
women whose infants were born with PPHN and 836 women whose infants were born 
healthy, the risk for developing PPHN was approximately six-fold higher for 
infants exposed to SSRIs after the 20th week of gestation compared to infants 
who had not been exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. There is currently 
no corroborative evidence regarding the risk for PPHN following exposure to 
SSRIs in pregnancy; this is the first study that has investigated the potential 
risk. The study did not include enough cases with exposure to individual SSRIs 
to determine if all SSRIs posed similar levels of PPHN risk.</p>
<p>When treating a pregnant woman with Celexa during the third trimester, the 
physician should carefully consider both the potential risks and benefits of 
treatment (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s95">DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION</a></span>). Physicians should note that in a prospective 
longitudinal study of 201 women with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4114950" conceptname="Endogenous depression">major depression</span> who were

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Labor and Delivery<p>The effect of Celexa on labor and delivery in humans is 
unknown.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Nursing Mothers<p>As has been found to occur with many other drugs, citalopram is

association with breastfeeding from a citalopram-treated mother; in one case, 
the infant was reported to recover completely upon discontinuation of citalopram 
by its mother and in the second case, no follow-up information was available. 
The decision whether to continue or discontinue either nursing or Celexa therapy

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">The premarketing development program for Celexa included 
citalopram exposures in patients and/or normal subjects from 3 different groups 
of studies: 429 normal subjects in clinical pharmacology/pharmacokinetic 
studies; 4422 exposures from patients in controlled and uncontrolled clinical 
trials, corresponding to approximately 1370 patient-exposure years. There were, 
in addition, over 19,000 exposures from mostly open-label, European 
postmarketing studies. The conditions and duration of treatment with Celexa 
varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) open-label and 
double-blind studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, fixed-dose and 
dose-titration studies, and short-term and long-term exposure. Adverse reactions 
were assessed by collecting adverse events, results of physical examinations, 
vital signs, weights, laboratory analyses, ECGs, and results of ophthalmologic 
examinations.</p>
<p>Adverse events during exposure were obtained primarily by general inquiry and 
recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. 
Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the 
proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping 
similar types of events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. 
In the tables and tabulations that follow, standard World Health Organization 
(WHO) terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events.</p>
<p>The stated frequencies of adverse events represent the proportion of 
individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse event 
of the type listed. An event was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred 
for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline 
evaluation.</p>

More Among Celexa -Treated Patients<p><span class="Bold"><a href="#t3">Table 3</a></span> enumerates the 
incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of treatment-emergent adverse events 
that occurred among 1063 depressed patients who received Celexa at doses ranging 
from 10 to 80 mg/day in placebo-controlled trials of up to 6 weeks in duration. 
Events included are those occurring in 2% or more of patients treated with 
Celexa and for which the incidence in patients treated with Celexa was greater 
than the incidence in placebo-treated patients.</p>
<p>The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict 
the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where 
patient characteristics and other factors differ from those which prevailed in 
the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with 
figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different 
treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the 
prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution 
of drug and non-drug factors to the adverse event incidence rate in the 
population studied.</p>
<p>The only commonly observed adverse event that occurred in Celexa patients 
with an incidence of 5% or greater and at least twice the incidence in placebo 
patients was <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4297368" conceptname="Abnormal ejaculation">ejaculation disorder</span> (primarily ejaculatory delay) in male patients

also be a consequence of pharmacologic treatment. In particular, some evidence 
suggests that SSRIs can cause such untoward sexual experiences.</p>
<p>Reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences 
involving sexual desire, performance, and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, 
however, in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss 
them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and 
performance cited in product labeling, are likely to underestimate their actual 
incidence.</p>

<p>While it is difficult to know the precise risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4237140" conceptname="Abnormal sexual function">sexual dysfunction</span> 
associated with the use of SSRIs, physicians should routinely inquire about such 
possible side effects.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Vital Sign Changes<p>Celexa and placebo groups were compared with respect to (1) mean 
change from baseline in vital signs (pulse, systolic blood pressure, and 
diastolic blood pressure) and (2) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for 
potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. 
These analyses did not reveal any clinically important changes in vital signs 
associated with Celexa treatment. In addition, a comparison of supine and 
standing vital sign measures for Celexa and placebo treatments indicated that 
Celexa treatment is not associated with orthostatic changes.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Weight Changes<p>Patients treated with Celexa in controlled trials experienced a 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> of about 0.5 kg compared to no change for placebo patients.</p>

change from baseline in various serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis 
variables, and (2) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially

revealed no clinically important changes in laboratory test parameters

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>ECG Changes<p>Electrocardiograms from Celexa (N=802) and placebo (N=241) groups

clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. The only 
statistically significant drug-placebo difference observed was a decrease in 
heart rate for Celexa of 1.7 bpm compared to no change in heart rate for 
placebo. There were no observed differences in QT or other ECG intervals.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Other Events Observed During the Premarketing 
Evaluation of Celexa (citalopram HBr)<p>Following is a list of WHO terms that reflect treatment-emergent 
adverse events, as defined in the introduction to the <span class="Bold"><a href="#s63">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span> section, reported by patients treated 
with Celexa at multiple doses in a range of 10 to 80 mg/day during any phase of 
a trial within the premarketing database of 4422 patients. All reported events 
are included except those already listed in <span class="Bold"><a href="#t3">Table 
3</a></span> or elsewhere in labeling, those events for which a drug cause was 
remote, those event terms which were so general as to be uninformative, and 
those occurring in only one patient. It is important to emphasize that, although 
the events reported occurred during treatment with Celexa, they were not 
necessarily caused by it.</p>
<p>Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of 
decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse 
events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients; 
infrequent adverse events are those occurring in less than 1/100 patients but at 
least 1/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 
patients.</p>

hemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. There are 
no specific antidotes for Celexa.</p>
<p>In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple-drug

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<a href="http://"></a>Initial Treatment<p class="First">Celexa (citalopram HBr) should be administered at an initial dose 
of 20 mg once daily, generally with an increase to a dose of 40 mg/day. Dose 
increases should usually occur in increments of 20 mg at intervals of no less 
than one week. Although certain patients may require a dose of 60 mg/day, the 
only study pertinent to dose response for effectiveness did not demonstrate an 
advantage for the 60 mg/day dose over the 40 mg/day dose; doses above 40 mg are 
therefore not ordinarily recommended.</p>
<p>Celexa should be administered once daily, in the morning or evening, with or 
without food.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Special Populations<p>20 mg/day is the recommended dose for most elderly patients and 
patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>, with titration to 40 mg/day only for 
nonresponding patients.</p>
<p>No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal 
impairment. Celexa should be used with caution in patients with severe renal 
impairment.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Treatment of Pregnant Women During the Third 
Trimester<p>Neonates exposed to Celexa and other SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the 
third trimester, have developed complications requiring prolonged 
hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s21">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>). When treating pregnant women with Celexa 
during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the 
potential risks and benefits of treatment. The physician may consider tapering 
Celexa in the third trimester.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Maintenance Treatment<p>It is generally agreed that acute episodes of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> require 
several months or longer of sustained pharmacologic therapy. Systematic 
evaluation of Celexa in two studies has shown that its antidepressant efficacy 
is maintained for periods of up to 24 weeks following 6 or 8 weeks of initial 
treatment (32 weeks total). In one study, patients were assigned randomly to 
placebo or to the same dose of Celexa (20-60 mg/day) during maintenance 
treatment as they had received during the acute stabilization phase, while in 
the other study, patients were assigned randomly to continuation of Celexa 20 or 
40 mg/day, or placebo, for maintenance treatment. In the latter study, the rates 
of relapse to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> were similar for the two dose groups (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s11">Clinical Trials</a></span> under <span class="Bold"><a href="#s4">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span>). Based on these limited data, it is 
not known whether the dose of citalopram needed to maintain euthymia is 
identical to the dose needed to induce remission. If adverse reactions are 
bothersome, a decrease in dose to 20 mg/day can be considered.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Discontinuation of Treatment with Celexa<p>Symptoms associated with discontinuation of Celexa and other 
SSRIs and SNRIs have been reported (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s21">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>). Patients should be monitored for these 
symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in the dose rather 
than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms 
occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, 
then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, 
the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Switching Patients To or From a Monoamine Oxidase 
Inhibitor<p>At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI 
and initiation of Celexa therapy. Similarly, at least 14 days should be allowed 
after stopping Celexa before starting an MAOI (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s14">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#s15">WARNINGS</a></span>).</p>

<h1>ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY</h1>
<a href="http://"></a>Retinal Changes in Rats<p class="First">Pathologic changes (degeneration/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4028206" conceptname="Atrophy">atrophy</span>) were observed in the 
retinas of albino rats in the 2-year carcinogenicity study with citalopram. 
There was an increase in both incidence and severity of retinal pathology in 
both male and female rats receiving 80 mg/kg/day (13 times the maximum 
recommended daily human dose of 60 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). 
Similar findings were not present in rats receiving 24 mg/kg/day for two years, 
in mice treated for 18 months at doses up to 240 mg/kg/day, or in dogs treated 
for one year at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (4, 20, and 10 times, respectively, the 
maximum recommended daily human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> 
basis).</p>
<p>Additional studies to investigate the mechanism for this pathology have not 
been performed, and the potential significance of this effect in humans has not 
been established.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Cardiovascular Changes in Dogs<p>In a one-year toxicology study, 5 of 10 beagle dogs receiving 
oral doses of 8 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of 
60 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) died suddenly between weeks 17 
and 31 following initiation of treatment. Although appropriate data from that 
study are not available to directly compare plasma levels of citalopram (CT) and 
its metabolites, demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT), to 
levels that have been achieved in humans, pharmacokinetic data indicate that the 
relative dog-to-human exposure was greater for the metabolites than for 
citalopram. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4132309" conceptname="Sudden death">Sudden deaths</span> were not observed in rats at doses up to 120 
mg/kg/day, which produced plasma levels of CT, DCT, and DDCT similar to those 
observed in dogs at doses of 8 mg/kg/day. A subsequent intravenous dosing study 
demonstrated that in beagle dogs, DDCT caused QT prolongation, a known risk 
factor for the observed outcome in dogs. This effect occurred in dogs at doses 
producing peak DDCT plasma levels of 810 to 3250 nM (39-155 times the mean 
steady state DDCT plasma level measured at the maximum recommended human daily 
dose of 60 mg). In dogs, peak DDCT plasma concentrations are approximately equal 
to peak CT plasma concentrations, whereas in humans, steady state DDCT plasma 
concentrations are less than 10% of steady state CT plasma concentrations. 
Assays of DDCT plasma concentrations in 2020 citalopram-treated individuals 
demonstrated that DDCT levels rarely exceeded 70 nM; the highest measured level 
of DDCT in human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> was 138 nM. While DDCT is ordinarily present in humans 
at lower levels than in dogs, it is unknown whether there are individuals who 
may achieve higher DDCT levels. The possibility that DCT, a principal metabolite 
in humans, may prolong the QT interval in dogs has not been directly examined 
because DCT is rapidly converted to DDCT in that species.</p>
