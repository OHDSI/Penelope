<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Central Nervous System</span></p>
<p>

Oxycodone is a semisynthetic pure opioid agonist whose principal therapeutic action is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>. Other pharmacological effects of oxycodone include anxiolysis, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142453" conceptname="Feeling high">euphoria</span> and feelings of relaxation. These effects are mediated by receptors (notably μ and #) in the central nervous system for endogenous opioid-like compounds such as endorphins and enkephalins. Oxycodone produces <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> through direct activity at respiratory centers in the brain stem and depresses the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> reflex by direct effect on the center of the medulla.</p>
<p>



Acetaminophen is a non-opiate, non-salicylate analgesic and antipyretic. The site and mechanism for the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span> of acetaminophen has not been determined. The antipyretic effect of acetaminophen is accomplished through the inhibition of endogenous pyrogen action on the hypothalamic heat-regulating centers.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle</span></p>
<p>

Oxycodone reduces motility by increasing smooth muscle tone in the stomach and duodenum. In the small intestine, digestion of food is delayed by decreases in propulsive contractions. Other opioid effects include contraction of biliary tract smooth muscle, spasm of the Sphincter of Oddi, increased ureteral and bladder sphincter tone, and a reduction in uterine tone.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Cardiovascular System</span></p>
<p>

Oxycodone may produce a release of histamine and may be associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span>, and other symptoms, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318566" conceptname="Flushing">flushing</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442546" conceptname="Red eye">red eyes</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span></p>
<p>

Absorption and Distribution – The mean absolute oral bioavailability of oxycodone in cancer patients was reported to be about 87%. Oxycodone has been shown to be 45% bound to human plasma proteins in vitro. The volume of distribution after intravenous administration is 

211.9 ± 186.6 L.</p>
<p>



Absorption of acetaminophen is rapid and almost complete from the GI tract after oral administration. With overdosage, absorption is complete in 4 hours. Acetaminophen is relatively uniformly distributed throughout most body fluids. Binding of the drug to plasma proteins is variable; only 20% to 50% may be bound at the concentrations encountered during acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Metabolism and Elimination</span></p>
<p>

A high portion of oxycodone is N-dealkylated to noroxycodone during first-pass metabolism. Oxymorphone, is formed by the O-demethylation of oxycodone. The metabolism of oxycodone to oxymorphone is catalyzed by CYP2D6. Free and conjugated noroxycodone, free and conjugated oxycodone, and oxymorphone are excreted in human urine following a single oral dose of oxycodone. Approximately 8% to 14% of the dose is excreted as free oxycodone over 

24 hours after administration. Following a single, oral dose of oxycodone, the mean ± SD elimination half-life is 3.51 ± 1.43 hours.</p>
<p>



Acetaminophen is metabolized in the liver via cytochrome P450 microsomal enzyme. About 80% to 85% of the acetaminophen in the body is conjugated principally with glucuronic acid and to a lesser extent with sulfuric acid and cysteine. After hepatic conjugation, 90% to 100% of the drug is recovered in the urine within the first day.</p>
<p>



About 4% of acetaminophen is metabolized via cytochrome P450 oxidase to a toxic metabolite which is further detoxified by conjugation with glutathione, present in a fixed amount. It is believed that the toxic metabolite NAPQI (N acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine, 

N-acetylimidoquinone) is responsible for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4337543" conceptname="Hepatic necrosis">liver necrosis</span>. High doses of acetaminophen may deplete the glutathione stores so that inactivation of the toxic metabolite is decreased. At high doses, the capacity of metabolic pathways for conjugation with glucuronic acid and sulfuric acid may be exceeded, resulting in increased metabolism of acetaminophen by alternate pathways.

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Opioids</span></p>
<p>Oxycodone is an opioid agonist of the morphine-type. Such drugs are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion.</p>
<p>Oxycodone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing oxycodone and acetaminophen oral solution in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. Concerns about misuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>.</p>
<p>Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</p>
<p>Administration of oxycodone and acetaminophen oral solution should be closely monitored for the following potentially serious adverse reactions and complications:</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">Respiratory Depression</span></span> – <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">Respiratory depression</span> is a hazard with the use of oxycodone, one of the active ingredients in oxycodone and acetaminophen oral solution, as with all opioid agonists. Elderly and debilitated patients are at particular risk for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> as are non-tolerant patients given large initial doses of oxycodone or when oxycodone is given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Oxycodone should be used with extreme caution in patients with acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>, chronic obstructive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="257907" conceptname="Disorder of lung">pulmonary disorder</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255573" conceptname="Chronic obstructive lung disease">COPD</span>), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4307356" conceptname="Cor pulmonale">cor pulmonale</span>, or pre-existing respiratory impairment. In such patients, even usual therapeutic doses of oxycodone may decrease respiratory drive to the point of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span>. In these patients alternative non-opioid analgesics should be considered, and opioids should be employed only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose.</p>
<p>In case of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, a reversal agent such as naloxone hydrochloride may be utilized (<span class="Italics">see </span><span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_c883539a-953a-4288-a69f-83f162a0a65d">OVERDOSAGE</a></span>).</p>

Oxycodone produces effects on pupillary response and consciousness which may obscure neurologic signs of worsening in patients with head injuries.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Hypotensive Effect</span> – Oxycodone may cause severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> particularly in individuals whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume, or after concurrent administration with drugs which compromise vasomotor tone such as phenothiazines.</p>
<p>Oxycodone, like all opioid analgesics of the morphine-type, should be administered with caution to patients in circulatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span>, since vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span> and blood pressure.

<h2>Information for Patients/Caregivers</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">The following information should be provided to patients receiving oxycodone and acetaminophen oral solution by their physician, nurse, pharmacist, or caregiver:</span></p>
<ol class="Arabic">
<li>Patients should be aware that oxycodone and acetaminophen oral solution contains oxycodone, which is a morphine-like substance.</li>
<li>Patients should be instructed to keep oxycodone and acetaminophen oral solution in a secure place out of the reach of children. In the case of accidental ingestions, emergency medical care should be sought immediately.
</li>
<li>When oxycodone and acetaminophen oral solution is no longer needed, the unused oral solution should be destroyed by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318566" conceptname="Flushing">flushing</span> down the toilet.
</li>
<li>Patients should be advised not to adjust the medication dose themselves. Instead, they must consult with their prescribing physician.
</li>
<li>Patients should be advised that oxycodone and acetaminophen oral solution may impair mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks (e.g., driving, operating heavy machinery).
</li>
<li>Patients should not combine oxycodone and acetaminophen oral solution with alcohol, opioid analgesics, tranquilizers, sedatives, or other CNS depressants unless under the recommendation and guidance of a physician. When co-administered with another CNS depressant, oxycodone and acetaminophen oral solution can cause dangerous additive central nervous system or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, which can result in serious injury or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.
</li>
<li>The safe use of oxycodone and acetaminophen oral solution during pregnancy has not been established; thus, women who are planning to become pregnant or are pregnant should consult with their physician before taking oxycodone and acetaminophen oral solution.
</li>
<li>Nursing mothers should consult with their physicians about whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue oxycodone and acetaminophen oral solution because of the potential for serious adverse reactions to nursing infants.
</li>
<li>Patients who are treated with oxycodone and acetaminophen oral solution for more than a few weeks should be advised not to abruptly discontinue the medication. Patients should consult with their physician for a gradual discontinuation dose schedule to taper off the medication.
</li>
<li>Patients should be advised that oxycodone and acetaminophen oral solution is a potential drug of abuse.

<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">Although oxycodone may cross-react with some drug urine tests, no available studies were found which determined the duration of detectability of oxycodone in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4215138" conceptname="Drug screening test">urine drug screens</span>. However, based on pharmacokinetic data, the approximate duration of detectability for a single dose of oxycodone is roughly estimated to be one to two days following drug exposure.</p>
<p>



Urine testing for opiates may be performed to determine illicit drug use and for medical reasons such as evaluation of patients with altered states of consciousness or monitoring efficacy of drug rehabilitation efforts. The preliminary identification of opiates in urine involves the use of an immunoassay screening and thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Gas chromatography/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> spectrometry (GC/MS) may be utilized as a third-stage identification step in the medical investigational sequence for opiate testing after immunoassay and TLC. The identities of 6-keto opiates (e.g., oxycodone) can further be differentiated by the analysis of their methoximetrimethylsilyl (MO-TMS) derivative.

<h2>Drug/Drug Interactions with Oxycodone</h2>
<p class="First">Opioid analgesics may enhance the neuromuscular-blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increase in the degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>.</p>
<p>



Patients receiving CNS depressants such as other opioid analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, centrally-acting anti-emetics, sedative-hypnotics or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with oxycodone and acetaminophen oral solution may exhibit an additive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span>. When such combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced. The concurrent use of anticholinergics with opioids may produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192357" conceptname="Paralytic ileus">paralytic ileus</span>.</p>
<p>



Agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, naltrexone, and butorphanol) should be administered with caution to a patient who has received or is receiving a pure opioid agonist such as oxycodone. These agonist/antagonist analgesics may reduce the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span> of oxycodone or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

<h2>Drug/Drug Interactions with Acetaminophen</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Alcohol, ethyl</span> – Hepatotoxicity has occurred in chronic alcoholics following various dose levels (moderate to excessive) of acetaminophen.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Anticholinergics</span> – The onset of acetaminophen effect may be delayed or decreased slightly, but the ultimate pharmacological effect is not significantly affected by anticholinergics.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Oral Contraceptives</span> – Increase in glucuronidation resulting in increased plasma clearance and a decreased half-life of acetaminophen.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Charcoal (activated)</span> – Reduces acetaminophen absorption when administered as soon as possible after <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Beta Blockers (Propranolol)</span> – Propranolol appears to inhibit the enzyme systems responsible for the glucuronidation and oxidation of acetaminophen. Therefore, the pharmacologic effects of acetaminophen may be increased.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Loop Diuretics</span> – The effects of the loop diuretic may be decreased because acetaminophen may decrease renal prostaglandin excretion and decrease plasma renin activity.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Lamotrigine</span> – Serum lamotrigine concentrations may be reduced, producing a decrease in therapeutic effects.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Probenecid</span> – Probenecid may increase the therapeutic effectiveness of acetaminophen slightly.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Zidovudine</span> – The pharmacologic effects of zidovudine may be decreased because of enhanced non-hepatic or renal clearance of zidovudine.

<h2>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Depending on the sensitivity/specificity and the test methodology, the individual components of oxycodone and acetaminophen oral solution may cross-react with assays used in the preliminary detection of cocaine (primary urinary metabolite, benzoylecgonine) or marijuana (cannabinoids) in human urine. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. The preferred confirmatory method is gas chromatography/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> spectrometry (GC/MS). Moreover, clinical considerations and professional judgment should be applied to any drug-of-abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.</p>
<p>



Acetaminophen may interfere with home blood glucose measurement systems; decreases of &gt;20% in mean glucose values may be noted. This effect appears to be drug, concentration and system dependent.

<h1>DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></h1>
<p class="First">Oxycodone and acetaminophen oral solution is a Schedule II controlled substance. Oxycodone is a mu-agonist opioid with an abuse liability similar to morphine. Oxycodone, like morphine and other opioids used in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, can be abused and is subject to criminal diversion.</p>
<p>



<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug addiction</span> is defined as an abnormal, compulsive use, use for non-medical purposes of a substance despite physical, psychological, occupational or interpersonal difficulties resulting from such use, and continued use despite harm or risk of harm.</p>
<p>



<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug addiction</span> is a treatable disease, utilizing a multi-disciplinary approach, but relapse is common. Opioid addiction is relatively rare in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436096" conceptname="Chronic pain">chronic pain</span> but may be more common in individuals who have a past history of alcohol or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4279309" conceptname="Substance abuse">substance abuse</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>. Pseudoaddiction refers to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relief seeking behavior of patients whose <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> is poorly managed. It is considered an iatrogenic effect of ineffective <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> management. The health care provider must assess continuously the psychological and clinical condition of a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> patient in order to distinguish addiction from pseudoaddiction and thus, be able to treat the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> adequately.</p>
<p>



Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> on a prescribed medication does not signify addiction. Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> involves the occurrence of a withdrawal syndrome when there is sudden reduction or cessation in drug use or if an opiate antagonist is administered. Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> can be detected after a few days of opioid therapy. However, clinically significant physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> is only seen after several weeks of relatively high dosage therapy. In this case, abrupt discontinuation of the opioid may result in a withdrawal syndrome. If the discontinuation of opioids is therapeutically indicated, gradual tapering of the drug over a 2-week period will prevent withdrawal symptoms. The severity of the withdrawal syndrome depends primarily on the daily dosage of the opioid, the duration of therapy and medical status of the individual.</p>

<p>



“Drug-seeking? behavior is very common in addicts and drug abusers. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated “loss? of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). “Doctor Shopping? to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>.</p>
<p>



Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction and is characterized by misuse for non-medical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. Oxycodone, like other opioids, has been diverted for non-medical use. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised.</p>
<p>



Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</p>
<p>



Like other opioid medications, oxycodone and acetaminophen oral solution is subject to the Federal Controlled Substances Act. After chronic use, oxycodone and acetaminophen oral solution should not be discontinued abruptly when it is thought that the patient has become physically dependent on oxycodone. </p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">
Following an acute overdosage, toxicity may result from the oxycodone or the acetaminophen.</p>

Toxicity from <span class="Italics">oxycodone</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">poisoning</span> includes the opioid triad of: pinpoint pupils, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> of respiration, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372448" conceptname="Loss of consciousness">loss of consciousness</span>.

Clinical and laboratory evidence of hepatic toxicity may not be apparent until 48 to 72 hours post-ingestion.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Treatment</span></p>
<p>

A single or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">multiple drug overdose</span> with oxycodone and acetaminophen is a potentially lethal polydrug <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, and consultation with a regional poison control center is recommended. Immediate treatment includes support of cardiorespiratory function and measures to reduce drug absorption. Oxygen, intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and other supportive measures should be employed as indicated. Assisted or controlled ventilation should also be considered.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Oxycodone</span></p>
<p>

Primary attention should be given to the reestablishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and the institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. The narcotic antagonist naloxone hydrochloride is a specific antidote against <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> which may result from overdosage or unusual sensitivity to narcotics, including oxycodone. Since the duration of action of oxycodone may exceed that of the antagonist, the patient should be kept under continued surveillance, and repeated doses of the antagonist should be administered as needed to maintain adequate respiration. A narcotic antagonist should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or cardiovascular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Acetaminophen</span></p>
<p>

Gastric decontamination with activated charcoal should be administered just prior to 

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to decrease systemic absorption if acetaminophen ingestion is known or suspected to have occurred within a few hours of presentation. Serum acetaminophen levels should be obtained immediately if the patient presents 4 hours or more after ingestion to assess potential risk of hepatotoxicity; acetaminophen levels drawn less than 4 hours post-ingestion may be misleading. To obtain the best possible outcome, NAC should be administered as soon as possible where impending or evolving <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver injury</span> is suspected. Intravenous NAC may be administered when circumstances preclude oral administration.</p>
<p>



Vigorous supportive therapy is required in severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>. Procedures to limit the continuing absorption of the drug must be readily performed since the hepatic injury is dose dependent and occurs early in the course of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>.</p>

It may occasionally be necessary to exceed the usual dosage recommended below in cases of more severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> or in those patients who have become tolerant to the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span> of opioids. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> is constant, the opioid analgesic should be given at regular intervals on an around-the-clock schedule. Oxycodone and acetaminophen oral solution is given orally.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Oral Solution</span></p>
<p>

The usual adult dosage is 5 mL (one teaspoonful) every six hours as needed for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>. The total daily dose of acetaminophen should not exceed 4 grams. (Maximum daily dose is 12 teaspoonfuls or 60 mL.)</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Cessation of Therapy</span></p>
<p>

In patients treated with oxycodone and acetaminophen oral solution for more than a few weeks who no longer require therapy, doses should be tapered gradually to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the physically dependent patient.
