<h1>DESCRIPTION
</h1>
<p class="First">The barbiturates are nonselective central nervous system depressants which are primarily used as sedative hypnotics and also anticonvulsants in subhypnotic doses. The barbiturates and their sodium salts are subject to control under the Federal Controlled Substances Act (See â€œ<a href="#s22">Drug Abuse and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">Dependence</span></a>â€? section).
</p>
<p>The sodium salts of amobarbital, pentobarbital, phenobarbital, and secobarbital are available as sterile parenteral solutions.
</p>
<p>Barbiturates are substituted pyrimidine derivatives in which the basic structure common to these drugs is barbituric acid, a substance which has no central nervous system (CNS) activity. CNS activity is obtained by substituting alkyl, alkenyl, or aryl groups on the pyrimidine ring.
</p>
<p>NEMBUTAL Sodium Solution (pentobarbital sodium injection) is a sterile solution for intravenous or intramuscular injection. Each mL contains pentobarbital sodium 50 mg, in a vehicle of propylene glycol, 40%, alcohol, 10% and water for injection, to volume. The pH is adjusted to approximately 9.5 with hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide.
</p>
<p>NEMBUTAL Sodium is a short-acting barbiturate, chemically designated as sodium 5-ethyl-5-(1-methylbutyl) barbiturate. The structural formula for pentobarbital sodium is:

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</h1>
<p class="First">Barbiturates are capable of producing all levels of CNS mood alteration from excitation to mild sedation, to hypnosis, and deep <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>. Overdosage can produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. In high enough therapeutic doses, barbiturates induce anesthesia.
</p>
<p>Barbiturates depress the sensory cortex, decrease motor activity, alter cerebellar function, and produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, sedation, and hypnosis.
</p>
<p>Barbiturate-induced sleep differs from physiological sleep. Sleep laboratory studies have demonstrated that barbiturates reduce the amount of time spent in the rapid eye movement (REM) phase of sleep or dreaming stage. Also, Stages III and IV sleep are decreased. Following abrupt cessation of barbiturates used regularly, patients may experience markedly increased dreaming, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4009184" conceptname="Dream anxiety disorder">nightmares</span>, and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>. Therefore, withdrawal of a single therapeutic dose over 5 or 6 days has been recommended to lessen the REM rebound and disturbed sleep which contribute to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441260" conceptname="Drug withdrawal">drug withdrawal syndrome</span> (for example, decrease the dose from 3 to 2 doses a day for 1 week).
</p>
<p>In studies, secobarbital sodium and pentobarbital sodium have been found to lose most of their effectiveness for both inducing and maintaining sleep by the end of 2 weeks of continued drug administration at fixed doses. The short-, intermediate-, and, to a lesser degree, long-acting barbiturates have been widely prescribed for treating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>. Although the clinical literature abounds with claims that the short-acting barbiturates are superior for producing sleep while the intermediate-acting compounds are more effective in maintaining sleep, controlled studies have failed to demonstrate these differential effects. Therefore, as sleep medications, the barbiturates are of limited value beyond short-term use.
</p>
<p>Barbiturates have little analgesic action at subanesthetic doses. Rather, in subanesthetic doses these drugs may increase the reaction to painful stimuli. All barbiturates exhibit anticonvulsant activity in anesthetic doses. However, of the drugs in this class, only phenobarbital, mephobarbital, and metharbital have been clinically demonstrated to be effective as oral anticonvulsants in subhypnotic doses.
</p>
<p>Barbiturates are respiratory depressants. The degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> is dependent upon dose. With hypnotic doses, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> produced by barbiturates is similar to that which occurs during physiologic sleep with slight decrease in blood pressure and heart rate.
</p>
<p>Studies in laboratory animals have shown that barbiturates cause reduction in the tone and contractility of the uterus, ureters, and urinary bladder. However, concentrations of the drugs required to produce this effect in humans are not reached with sedative-hypnotic doses.
</p>
<p>Barbiturates do not impair normal hepatic function, but have been shown to induce liver microsomal enzymes, thus increasing and/or altering the metabolism of barbiturates and other drugs. (See â€œ<a href="#s9">Precautionsâ€”</a><span class="Italics"><a href="#s12">Drug Interactions</a></span>â€? section).

<h2>Pharmacokinetics:
</h2>
<p class="First">Barbiturates are absorbed in varying degrees following oral, rectal, or parenteral administration. The salts are more rapidly absorbed than are the acids.
</p>
<p>The onset of action for oral or rectal administration varies from 20 to 60 minutes. For IM administration, the onset of action is slightly faster. Following IV administration, the onset of action ranges from almost immediately for pentobarbital sodium to 5 minutes for phenobarbital sodium. Maximal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span> may not occur until 15 minutes or more after IV administration for phenobarbital sodium.
</p>
<p>Duration of action, which is related to the rate at which the barbiturates are redistributed throughout the body, varies among persons and in the same person from time to time.
</p>
<p>No studies have demonstrated that the different routes of administration are equivalent with respect to bioavailability.
</p>
<p>Barbiturates are weak acids that are absorbed and rapidly distributed to all tissues and fluids with high concentrations in the brain, liver, and kidneys. Lipid solubility of the barbiturates is the dominant factor in their distribution within the body. The more lipid soluble the barbiturate, the more rapidly it penetrates all tissues of the body. Barbiturates are bound to plasma and tissue proteins to a varying degree with the degree of binding increasing directly as a function of lipid solubility.
</p>
<p>Phenobarbital has the lowest lipid solubility, lowest plasma binding, lowest brain protein binding, the longest delay in onset of activity, and the longest duration of action. At the opposite extreme is secobarbital which has the highest lipid solubility, plasma protein binding, brain protein binding, the shortest delay in onset of activity, and the shortest duration of action. Butabarbital is classified as an intermediate barbiturate.
</p>
<p>The plasma half-life for pentobarbital in adults is 15 to 50 hours and appears to be dose dependent.
</p>
<p>Barbiturates are metabolized primarily by the hepatic microsomal enzyme system, and the metabolic products are excreted in the urine, and less commonly, in the feces. Approximately 25 to 50 percent of a dose of aprobarbital or phenobarbital is eliminated unchanged in the urine, whereas the amount of other barbiturates excreted unchanged in the urine is negligible. The excretion of unmetabolized barbiturate is one feature that distinguishes the long-acting category from those belonging to other categories which are almost entirely metabolized. The inactive metabolites of the barbiturates are excreted as conjugates of glucuronic acid.

<a name="s10"></a><a name="section-7.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>General:
</h2>
<p class="First">Barbiturates may be habit forming. Tolerance and psychological and physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> may occur with continuing use. (See â€œ<a href="#s22">Drug Abuse and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">Dependence</span></a>â€? section.) Barbiturates should be administered with caution, if at all, to patients who are mentally depressed, have suicidal tendencies, or a history of drug abuse.
</p>
<p>Elderly or debilitated patients may react to barbiturates with marked <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">excitement</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>.

</p>
<p>In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">hepatic damage</span>, barbiturates should be administered with caution and initially in reduced doses. Barbiturates should not be administered to patients showing the premonitory signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377604" conceptname="Hepatic coma">hepatic coma</span>.
</p>
<p>Parenteral solutions of barbiturates are highly alkaline. Therefore, extreme care should be taken to avoid perivascular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4295895" conceptname="Extravasation">extravasation</span> or intra-arterial injection.

<h2>Information for the patient:
</h2>
<p class="First">Practitioners should give the following information and instructions to patients receiving barbiturates.
</p>
<ol class="Arabic">
<li>The use of barbiturates carries with it an associated risk of psychological and/or physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>. The patient should be warned against increasing the dose of the drug without consulting a physician.
</li>
<li>Barbiturates may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks (e.g., driving, operating machinery, etc.).
</li>
<li>Alcohol should not be consumed while taking barbiturates. Concurrent use of the barbiturates with other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, narcotics, tranquilizers, and antihistamines) may result in additional CNS depressant effects.

<a name="e11"></a><a name="section-7.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Laboratory tests:
</h2>
<p class="First">Prolonged therapy with barbiturates should be accompanied by periodic laboratory evaluation of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic systems. (See â€œ<a href="#s9">Precautions-</a><span class="Italics"><a href="#s10">General</a></span>â€? and â€œ<a href="#s21">Adverse Reactions</a>â€? sections.)

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34073-7">
<a name="s12"></a><a name="section-7.4"></a><p></p>
<h2>Drug interactions:
</h2>
<p class="First">Most reports of clinically significant drug interactions occurring with the barbiturates have involved phenobarbital. However, the application of these data to other barbiturates appears valid and warrants serial blood level determinations of the relevant drugs when there are multiple therapies.
</p>
<ol class="Arabic">
<li>
<span class="Italics"> Anticoagulants</span>: Phenobarbital lowers the plasma levels of dicumarol (name previously used: bishydroxycoumarin) and causes a decrease in anticoagulant activity as measured by the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time. Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon). Patients stabilized on anticoagulant therapy may require dosage adjustments if barbiturates are added to or withdrawn from their dosage regimen.
</li>
<li>
<span class="Italics"> Corticosteroids</span>: Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes. Patients stabilized on corticosteroid therapy may require dosage adjustments if barbiturates are added to or withdrawn from their dosage regimen.
</li>
<li>
<span class="Italics"> Griseofulvin</span>: Phenobarbital appears to interfere with the absorption of orally administered griseofulvin, thus decreasing its blood level. The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established. However, it would be preferable to avoid concomitant administration of these drugs.
</li>
<li>
<span class="Italics"> Doxycycline</span>: Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued.<br>This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic. If phenobarbital and doxycycline are administered concurrently, the clinical response to doxycycline should be monitored closely.
</li>
<li>
<span class="Italics"> Phenytoin, sodium valproate, valproic acid:</span> The effect of barbiturates on the metabolism of phenytoin appears to be variable. Some investigators report an accelerating effect, while others report no effect. Because the effect of barbiturates on the metabolism of phenytoin is not predictable, phenytoin and barbiturate blood levels should be monitored more frequently if these drugs are given concurrently. Sodium valproate and valproic acid appear to decrease barbiturate metabolism; therefore, barbiturate blood levels should be monitored and appropriate dosage adjustments made as indicated.
</li>
<li>
<span class="Italics"> Central nervous system depressants:</span> The concomitant use of other central nervous system depressants, including other sedatives or hypnotics, antihistamines, tranquilizers, or alcohol, may produce additive depressant effects.
</li>
<li>
<span class="Italics"> Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI):</span> MAOI prolong the effects of barbiturates probably because metabolism of the barbiturate is inhibited.
</li>
<li>
<span class="Italics"> Estradiol, estrone, progesterone and other steroidal hormones:</span> Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism. There have been reports of patients treated with antiepileptic drugs (e.g., phenobarbital) who became pregnant while taking oral contraceptives. An alternate contraceptive method might be suggested to women taking phenobarbital.

<h2>Carcinogenesis:
</h2>
<ol class="Arabic">
<li>
<span class="Italics"> Animal data.</span> Phenobarbital sodium is carcinogenic in mice and rats after lifetime administration. In mice, it produced benign and malignant liver cell tumors. In rats, benign liver cell tumors were observed very late in life.
</li>
<li>

Thus, this study did not provide sufficient evidence that phenobarbital sodium is carcinogenic in humans.

<p class="First">No adequate well-controlled studies have been conducted in pediatric patients; however, safety and effectiveness of pentobarbital in pediatric patients is supported by numerous studies and case reports cited in the literature.
</p>
<p>Pediatric dosing information for Nembutal is described in the <a href="#s24">DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION</a> section.

<h2>Geriatric Use:
</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of Nembutal have not included sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects.  Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.  In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.
</p>
<p>Elderly patients may react to barbiturates with marked <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">excitement</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>.  In some persons, barbiturates repeatedly produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">excitement</span> rather than <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.  Dosage should be reduced in the elderly because these patients may be more sensitive to barbiturates.

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS

<h1>DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span>
</h1>
<p class="First">Pentobarbital sodium injection is subject to control by the Federal Controlled Substances Act under DEA schedule II.
</p>
<p>Barbiturates may be habit forming. Tolerance, psychological <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>, and physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> may occur especially following prolonged use of high doses of barbiturates. Daily administration in excess of 400 milligrams (mg) of pentobarbital or secobarbital for approximately 90 days is likely to produce some degree of physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>. A dosage of from 600 to 800 mg taken for at least 35 days is sufficient to produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218977" conceptname="Drug withdrawal seizure">withdrawal seizures</span>. The average daily dose for the barbiturate addict is usually about 1.5 grams. As tolerance to barbiturates develops, the amount needed to maintain the same level of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> increases; tolerance to a fatal dosage, however, does not increase more than two-fold. As this occurs, the margin between an intoxicating dosage and fatal dosage becomes smaller.
</p>
<p>Symptoms of acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> with barbiturates include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437643" conceptname="Abnormal gait">unsteady gait</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196636" conceptname="Dysarthria">slurred speech</span>, and sustained <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378165" conceptname="Nystagmus">nystagmus</span>. Mental signs of chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, poor judgment, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, and somatic complaints.
</p>
<p>Symptoms of barbiturate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> are similar to those of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435243" conceptname="Alcohol dependence">chronic alcoholism</span>. If an individual appears to be intoxicated with alcohol to a degree that is radically disproportionate to the amount of alcohol in his or her blood the use of barbiturates should be suspected. The lethal dose of a barbiturate is far less if alcohol is also ingested.
</p>
<p>The symptoms of barbiturate withdrawal can be severe and may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. Minor withdrawal symptoms may appear 8 to 12 hours after the last dose of a barbiturate. These symptoms usually appear in the following order: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4247265" conceptname="Muscle twitch">muscle twitching</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span> of hands and fingers, progressive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">weakness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, distortion in visual perception, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span>. Major withdrawal symptoms (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373995" conceptname="Delirium">delirium</span>) may occur within 16 hours and last up to 5 days after abrupt cessation of these drugs. Intensity of withdrawal symptoms gradually declines over a period of approximately 15 days. Individuals susceptible to barbiturate abuse and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> include alcoholics and opiate abusers, as well as other sedative-hypnotic and amphetamine abusers.
</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug dependence</span> to barbiturates arises from repeated administration of a barbiturate or agent with barbiturate-like effect on a continuous basis, generally in amounts exceeding therapeutic dose levels. The characteristics of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">drug dependence</span> to barbiturates include: (a) a strong desire or need to continue taking the drug; (b) a tendency to increase the dose; (c) a psychic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> on the effects of the drug related to subjective and individual appreciation of those effects; and (d) a physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> on the effects of the drug requiring its presence for maintenance of homeostasis and resulting in a definite, characteristic, and self-limited abstinence syndrome when the drug is withdrawn.
</p>
<p>Treatment of barbiturate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> consists of cautious and gradual withdrawal of the drug. Barbiturate-dependent patients can be withdrawn by using a number of different withdrawal regimens. In all cases withdrawal takes an extended period of time. One method involves substituting a 30 mg dose of phenobarbital for each 100 to 200 mg dose of barbiturate that the patient has been taking. The total daily amount of phenobarbital is then administered in 3 to 4 divided doses, not to exceed 600 mg daily. Should signs of withdrawal occur on the first day of treatment, a loading dose of 100 to 200 mg of phenobarbital may be administered IM in addition to the oral dose. After stabilization on phenobarbital, the total daily dose is decreased by 30 mg a day as long as withdrawal is proceeding smoothly. A modification of this regimen involves initiating treatment at the patient's regular dosage level and decreasing the daily dosage by 10 percent if tolerated by the patient.
</p>
<p>Infants physically dependent on barbiturates may be given phenobarbital 3 to 10 mg/kg/day. After withdrawal symptoms (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">hyperactivity</span>, disturbed sleep, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremors</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4313132" conceptname="Hyperreflexia">hyperreflexia</span>) are relieved, the dosage of phenobarbital should be gradually decreased and completely withdrawn over a 2-week period.

<h1>OVERDOSAGE
</h1>
<p class="First">The toxic dose of barbiturates varies considerably. In general, an oral dose of 1 gram of most barbiturates produces serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">poisoning</span> in an adult. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Death</span> commonly occurs after 2 to 10 grams of ingested barbiturate. Barbiturate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> may be <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confused</span> with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218106" conceptname="Alcoholism">alcoholism</span>, bromide <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>, and with various neurological disorders.
</p>
<p>Acute overdosage with barbiturates is manifested by CNS and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> which may progress to Cheyne-Stokes respiration, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4290597" conceptname="Absent reflex">areflexia</span>, constriction of the pupils to a slight degree (though in severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">poisoning</span> they may show paralytic dilation), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306451" conceptname="Oliguria">oliguria</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, lowered body temperature, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>. Typical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span> syndrome (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">circulatory collapse</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317109" conceptname="Respiratory arrest">respiratory arrest</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>) may occur. In extreme <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, all electrical activity in the brain may cease, in which case a â€œflatâ€? EEG normally equated with clinical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> cannot be accepted. This effect is fully reversible unless <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxic</span> damage occurs. Consideration should be given to the possibility of barbiturate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> even in situations that appear to involve <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433633" conceptname="Late effect of superficial injury">trauma</span>.

<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Intramuscular Administration:</span> IM injection of the sodium salts of barbiturates should be made deeply into a large muscle, and a volume of 5 mL should not be exceeded at any one site because of possible tissue irritation. After IM injection of a hypnotic dose, the patient's vital signs should be monitored. The usual adult dosage of NEMBUTAL Sodium Solution is 150 to 200 mg as a single IM injection; the recommended pediatric dosage ranges from 2 to 6 mg/kg as a single IM injection not to exceed 100 mg.

Slow IV injection is essential, and patients should be carefully observed during  administration.

The rate of IV injection should not exceed 50 mg/min for pentobarbital sodium.

<p>There is no average intravenous dose of NEMBUTAL Sodium Solution (pentobarbital sodium injection) that can be relied on to produce similar effects in different patients. The possibility of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> is remote when the drug is injected slowly in fractional doses.
</p>
<p>A commonly used initial dose for the 70 kg adult is 100 mg. Proportional reduction in dosage should be made for pediatric or debilitated patients. At least one minute is necessary to determine the full effect of intravenous pentobarbital. If necessary, additional small increments of the drug may be given up to a total of from 200 to 500 mg for normal adults.
