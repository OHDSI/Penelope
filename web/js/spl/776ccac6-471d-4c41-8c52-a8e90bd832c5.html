<h1><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION </span></h1>
<p class="First">Nifedipine is an antianginal drug belonging to a class of pharmacological agents, the calcium channel blockers. Nifedipine is 3,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid, 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-4-(2-nitrophenyl)-, dimethyl ester, C<span class="Sub">17</span>H<span class="Sub">18</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">6</span>, and has the structural formula:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="2be1748e-figure-01" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=776ccac6-471d-4c41-8c52-a8e90bd832c5&amp;name=776ccac6-471d-4c41-8c52-a8e90bd832c5-01.jpg"></div>
<p>Nifedipine is a yellow crystalline substance, practically insoluble in water but soluble in ethanol. It has a molecular weight of 346.3. Nifedipine capsules are formulated as soft gelatin capsules for oral administration each containing 10 mg nifedipine.</p>
<p>Inert ingredients in the formulation are: FD&amp;C blue number 1 lake, gelatin, glycerin, isobutyl alcohol, menthol, polyethylene glycol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, red iron oxide, shellac, sorbitol, sorbitans, titanium dioxide and water.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY </span></h1>
<p class="First">Nifedipine is a calcium ion influx inhibitor (slow-channel blocker or calcium ion antagonist) and inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Nifedipine selectively inhibits calcium ion influx across the cell membrane of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action </span></h2>
<p class="First">The precise means by which this inhibition relieves angina has not been fully determined, but includes at least the following two mechanisms:</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">1) Relaxation and Prevention of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4127089" conceptname="Coronary artery spasm">Coronary Artery Spasm</span></span></span></p>
<p>Nifedipine dilates the main coronary arteries and coronary arterioles, both in normal and ischemic regions, and is a potent inhibitor of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4127089" conceptname="Coronary artery spasm">coronary artery spasm</span>, whether spontaneous or ergonovine-induced.  This property increases myocardial oxygen delivery in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4127089" conceptname="Coronary artery spasm">coronary artery spasm</span>, and is responsible for the effectiveness of nifedipine in vasospastic (Prinzmetal’s or variant) angina.  Whether this effect plays any role in classical angina is not clear, but studies of exercise tolerance have not shown an increase in the maximum exercise rate-pressure product, a widely accepted measure of oxygen utilization. This suggests that, in general, relief of spasm or dilation of coronary arteries is not an important factor in classical angina.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">2) Reduction of Oxygen Utilization</span></span></p>
<p>Nifedipine regularly reduces arterial pressure at rest and at a given level of exercise by dilating peripheral arterioles and reducing the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works. This unloading of the heart reduces myocardial energy consumption and oxygen requirements and probably accounts for the effectiveness of nifedipine in chronic stable angina.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism </span></h2>
<p class="First">Nifedipine is rapidly and fully absorbed after oral administration. The drug is detectable in serum 10 minutes after oral administration, and peak blood levels occur in approximately 30 minutes. Bioavailability is proportional to dose from 10 to 30 mg; half-life does not change significantly with dose.  There is little difference in relative bioavailability when nifedipine capsules are given orally and either swallowed whole, bitten and swallowed, or bitten and held sublingually. However, biting through the capsule prior to swallowing does result in slightly earlier plasma concentrations (27 ng/mL 10 minutes after 10 mg) than if capsules are swallowed intact. It is highly bound by serum proteins. Nifedipine is extensively converted to inactive metabolites and approximately 80 percent of nifedipine and metabolites are eliminated via the kidneys. The half-life of nifedipine in plasma is approximately two hours. Since hepatic biotransformation is the predominant route for the disposition of nifedipine, the pharmacokinetics may be altered in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">chronic liver disease</span>. Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4064161" conceptname="Cirrhosis of liver">liver cirrhosis</span>) have a longer disposition half-life and higher bioavailability of nifedipine than healthy volunteers. The degree of serum protein binding of nifedipine is high (92–98%). Protein binding may be greatly reduced in patients with renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>.</p>
<p>In healthy subjects, the elimination half-life of a BID sustained release nifedipine formulation [that was neither Nifedipine Capsules nor Nifedipine Extended Release Tablets] was longer in elderly subjects (6.7 h) compared to young subjects (3.8 h) following oral administration. A decreased clearance was also observed in the elderly (348 mL/min) following intravenous administration.</p>
<p>Co-administration of nifedipine with grapefruit juice resulted in approximately a 2-fold increase in nifedipine AUC and Cmax with no change in half-life. The increased plasma concentrations are most likely due to inhibition of CYP 3A4 related first-pass metabolism.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Hemodynamics </span></h2>
<p class="First">Like other slow-channel blockers, nifedipine exerts a negative inotropic effect on isolated myocardial tissue. This is rarely, if ever, seen in intact animals or man, probably because of reflex responses to its vasodilating effects. In man, nifedipine causes decreased peripheral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span> and a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> in systolic and diastolic pressure, usually modest (5–10mm Hg systolic), but sometimes larger. There is usually a small increase in heart rate, a reflex response to vasodilation. Measurements of cardiac function in patients with normal ventricular function have generally found a small increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208254" conceptname="Cardiac index">cardiac index</span> without major effects on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4108582" conceptname="Left ventricular ejection fraction">ejection fraction</span>, left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) or volume (LVEDV). In patients with impaired ventricular function, most acute studies have shown some increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4108582" conceptname="Left ventricular ejection fraction">ejection fraction</span> and reduction in left ventricular filling pressure.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Electrophysiologic Effects </span></h2>
<p class="First">Although, like other members of its class, nifedipine decreases sinoatrial node function and atrioventricular conduction in isolated myocardial preparations, such effects have not been seen in studies in intact animals or in man. In formal electrophysiologic studies, predominantly in patients with normal conduction systems, nifedipine has had no tendency to prolong atrioventricular conduction, prolong sinus node recovery time, or slow sinus rate.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE </span></h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">I. Vasospastic Angina</span></p>
<p>Nifedipine is indicated for the management of vasospastic angina confirmed by any of the following criteria: 1) classical pattern of angina at rest accompanied by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4295129" conceptname="ST segment elevation">ST segment elevation</span>, 2) angina or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4127089" conceptname="Coronary artery spasm">coronary artery spasm</span> provoked by ergonovine, or 3) angiographically demonstrated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4127089" conceptname="Coronary artery spasm">coronary artery spasm</span>. In those patients who have had angiography, the presence of significant fixed obstructive disease is not incompatible with the diagnosis of vasospastic angina, provided that the above criteria are satisfied. Nifedipine may also be used where the clinical presentation suggests a possible vasospastic component but where <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4215494" conceptname="Vasospasm">vasospasm</span> has not been confirmed, e.g., where <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> has a variable threshold on exertion or when angina is refractory to nitrates and/or adequate doses of beta blockers.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">II. Chronic Stable Angina (Classical Effort-Associated Angina)</span></p>
<p>Nifedipine is indicated for the management of chronic stable angina (effort-associated angina) without evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4215494" conceptname="Vasospasm">vasospasm</span> in patients who remain symptomatic despite adequate doses of beta blockers and/or organic nitrates or who cannot tolerate those agents.  In chronic stable angina (effort-associated angina) nifedipine has been effective in controlled trials of up to eight weeks duration in reducing angina frequency and increasing exercise tolerance, but confirmation of sustained effectiveness and evaluation of long-term safety in these patients are incomplete.  Controlled studies in small numbers of patients suggest concomitant use of nifedipine and betablocking agents may be beneficial in patients with chronic stable angina, but available information is not sufficient to predict with confidence the effects of concurrent treatment, especially in patients with compromised left ventricular function or cardiac conduction abnormalities. When introducing such concomitant therapy, care must be taken to monitor blood pressure closely since severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> can occur from the combined effects of the drugs.

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span></span></p>
<p>Although, in most patients, the hypotensive effect of nifedipine is modest and well tolerated, occasional patients have had excessive and poorly tolerated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>. These responses have usually occurred during initial titration or at the time of subsequent upward dosage adjustment. Although patients have rarely experienced excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> on nifedipine alone, this may be more common in patients on concomitant beta-blocker therapy. Although not approved for this purpose, nifedipine and other immediate-release nifedipine capsules have been used (orally and sublingually) for acute reduction of blood pressure. Several well-documented reports describe cases of profound <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> when immediate-release nifedipine was used in this way. <span class="Bold">Nifedipine capsules should not be used for the acute reduction of blood pressure.</span></p>

<p>Several well-controlled, randomized trials studied the use of immediate-release nifedipine in patients who had just sustained <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarctions</span>. In none of these trials did immediate-release nifedipine appear to provide any benefit. In some of the trials, patients who received immediate-release nifedipine had significantly worse outcomes than patients who received placebo. <span class="Bold">Nifedipine capsules should not be administered within the first week or two after <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, and they should also be avoided in the setting of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4215140" conceptname="Acute coronary syndrome">acute coronary syndrome</span> (when <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4206471" conceptname="Infarct">infarction</span> may be imminent).</span></p>
<p>Severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> and/or increased fluid volume requirements have been reported in patients receiving nifedipine together with a beta-blocking agent who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery using high dose fentanyl anesthesia. The interaction with high dose fentanyl appears to be due to the combination of nifedipine and a beta blocker, but the possibility that it may occur with nifedipine alone, with low doses of fentanyl, in other surgical procedures, or with other narcotic analgesics cannot be ruled out. In nifedipine treated patients where surgery using high dose fentanyl anesthesia is contemplated, the physician should be aware of these potential problems and, if the patient’s condition permits, sufficient time (at least 36 hours) should be allowed for nifedipine to be washed out of the body prior to surgery.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Increased Angina and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">Myocardial Infarction</span></span></p>
<p>Rarely, patients, particularly those who have severe obstructive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317576" conceptname="Coronary arteriosclerosis">coronary artery disease</span>, have developed well documented increased frequency, duration and/or severity of angina or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">acute myocardial infarction</span> on starting nifedipine or at the time of dosage increase. The mechanism of this effect is not established.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Beta Blocker Withdrawal</span></p>
<p>Patients recently withdrawn from beta blockers may develop a withdrawal syndrome with increased angina, probably related to increased sensitivity to catecholamines. Initiation of nifedipine treatment will not prevent this occurrence and might be expected to exacerbate it by provoking reflex catecholamine release. There have been occasional reports of increased angina in a setting of beta blocker withdrawal and nifedipine initiation. It is important to taper beta blockers if possible, rather than stopping them abruptly before beginning nifedipine.</p>

<p>Rarely, patients, usually receiving a beta blocker, have developed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> after beginning nifedipine.  Patients with tight <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4189343" conceptname="Aortic valve stenosis">aortic stenosis</span> may be at greater risk for such an event, as the unloading effect of nifedipine would be expected to be of less benefit to these patients, owing to their fixed impedance to flow across the aortic valve.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span></span></p>
<p>Because nifedipine decreases peripheral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span>, careful monitoring of blood pressure during the initial administration and titration of nifedipine is suggested.

Experience in over 1400 patients in a non-comparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>, severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> or exacerbation of angina.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Long-acting nitrates</span></p>
<p>Nifedipine may be safely co-administered with nitrates, but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Digitalis</span></p>
<p>Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Quinidine</span></p>
<p>There have been rare reports of an interaction between quinidine and nifedipine (with a decreased plasma level of quinidine).</p>

Ranitidine produced smaller, non-significant increases. The effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of cimetidine on hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system probably responsible for the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine. If nifedipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, cautious titration is advised.</p>

<p>Nifedipine has been shown to produce teratogenic findings in rats and rabbits, including digital anomalies similar to those reported for phenytoin. Digital anomalies have been reported to occur with other members of the dihydropyridine class and are possibly a result of compromised uterine blood flow.  Nifedipine administration was associated with a variety of embryotoxic, placentotoxic, and fetotoxic effects, including stunted fetuses (rats, mice, rabbits), rib deformities (mice), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135923" conceptname="Cleft palate">cleft palate</span> (mice), small placentas and underdeveloped chorionic villi (monkeys), embryonic and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079844" conceptname="Fetal death">fetal deaths</span> (rats, mice, rabbits), and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432695" conceptname="Post-term pregnancy">prolonged pregnancy</span>/decreased neonatal survival (rats; not evaluated in other species). On a mg/kg basis, all of the doses associated with the teratogenic embryotoxic or fetotoxic effects in animals were higher (3.5 to 42 times) than the maximum recommended human dose of 120 mg/day. On a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, some doses were higher and some were lower than the maximum recommended human dose but all are within an order of magnitude of it. The doses associated with placentotoxic effects in monkeys were equivalent to or lower than the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Nifedipine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Geriatric Use </span></h2>
<p class="First">Although small pharmacokinetic studies have identified an increased half-life and increased Cmax and AUC (See <a href="#i4i_section_id_f76c7388-3a81-422c-a900-3994b9abcb5c">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</a>), clinical studies of nifedipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>

<p class="First">In multiple-dose U.S. and foreign controlled studies in which adverse reactions were reported spontaneously, adverse effects were frequent but generally not serious and rarely required discontinuation of therapy or dosage adjustment.

<p class="First">Experience with nifedipine overdosage is limited. Generally, overdosage with nifedipine leading to pronounced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> calls for active cardiovascular support including monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, and judicious use of calcium infusion, pressor agents and fluids. Clearance of nifedipine would be expected to be prolonged in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4326594" conceptname="Abnormal liver function">impaired liver function</span>.

<h1><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION </span></h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">The dosage of nifedipine needed to suppress angina and that can be tolerated by the patient must be established by titration. Excessive doses can result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>.</span></p>
<p>Therapy should be initiated with the 10 mg capsule. The starting dose is one 10 mg capsule, swallowed whole, 3 times/day. The usual effective dose range is 10–20 mg three times daily. Some patients, especially those with evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4127089" conceptname="Coronary artery spasm">coronary artery spasm</span>, respond only to higher doses, more frequent administration, or both. In such patients, doses of 20–30 mg three or four times daily may be effective.  Doses above 120 mg daily are rarely necessary. More than 180 mg per day is not recommended.</p>
<p>In most cases, nifedipine titration should proceed over a 7–14 day period so that the physician can assess the response to each dose level andmonitor the blood pressure before proceeding to higher doses.</p>
<p>If symptoms so warrant, titration may proceed more rapidly provided that the patient is assessed frequently. Based on the patient’s physical activity level, attack frequency, and sublingual nitroglycerin consumption, the dose of nifedipine may be increased from 10 mg t.i.d. to 20 mg t.i.d. and then to 30 mg t.i.d. over a three-day period.</p>
<p>In hospitalized patients under close observation, the dose may be increased in 10 mg increments over four- to six-hour periods as required to control <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span> due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4200991" conceptname="Ischemia">ischemia</span>. A single dose should rarely exceed 30 mg.</p>
<p>Co-administration of nifedipine with grapefruit juice is to be avoided (See <a href="#i4i_clinical_pharmacology_id_52bc1688-7df1-46fe-9ce2-92e8829f6dd7">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a> and <a href="#i4i_section_id_af70d9ac-0d69-493e-8c6d-a1a64065a962">PRECAUTIONS: Other Interactions</a>).</p>
<p>No “rebound effect? has been observed upon discontinuation of nifedipine. However, if discontinuation of nifedipine is necessary, sound clinical practice suggests that the dosage should be decreased gradually with close physician supervision.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Co-Administration with Other Antianginal Drugs</span></p>
<p>Sublingual nitroglycerin may be taken as required for the control of acute manifestations of angina, particularly during nifedipine titration. See <a href="#i4i_interactions_id_2bab7f9f-aece-42b5-a802-623050335f7f">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</a>, for information on coadministration of nifedipine with beta blockers or long-acting nitrates.</p>
