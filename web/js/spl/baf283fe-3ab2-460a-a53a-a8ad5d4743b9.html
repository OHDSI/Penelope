<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Lovastatin is a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> lowering agent isolated from a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span> of <span class="Italics">Aspergillus terreus.</span> After oral ingestion, lovastatin, which is an inactive lactone, is hydrolyzed to the corresponding β-hydroxyacid form. This is a principal metabolite and an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, which is an early and rate limiting step in the biosynthesis of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>.
</p>
<p>Lovastatin is [1 <span class="Italics">S</span>   -[1α(<span class="Italics">R</span> *), 3α, 7β, 8β(2 <span class="Italics">S</span>   *,4 <span class="Italics">S</span>   *),8aβ]]-1,2,3, 7,8,8a-hexahydro-3,7-dimethyl-8-[2-(tetrahydro-4-hydroxy-6-oxo-2 <span class="Italics">H</span> -pyran-2-yl)ethyl]-1-naphthalenyl 2-methylbutanoate. The empirical formula of lovastatin is C <span class="Sub">24</span> H <span class="Sub">36</span> O <span class="Sub">5</span> and its molecular weight is 404.55. Its structural formula is:

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>The involvement of low-density lipoprotein <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> (LDL-C) in atherogenesis has been well documented in clinical and pathological studies, as well as in many animal experiments. Epidemiological and clinical studies have established that high LDL-C and low high-density lipoprotein <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> (HDL-C) are both associated with coronary heart disease. However, the risk of developing coronary heart disease is continuous and graded over the range of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> levels and many coronary events do occur in patients with total <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> (total-C) and LDL-C in the lower end of this range.
</p>
<p>Lovastatin has been shown to reduce both normal and elevated LDL-C concentrations. LDL is formed from very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and is catabolized predominantly by the high affinity LDL receptor. The mechanism of the LDL-lowering effect of lovastatin may involve both reduction of VLDL-C concentration, and induction of the LDL receptor, leading to reduced production and/or increased catabolism of LDL-C. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4122128" conceptname="Apolipoprotein">Apolipoprotein</span> B also <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falls</span> substantially during treatment with lovastatin. Since each LDL particle contains one molecule of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4122128" conceptname="Apolipoprotein">apolipoprotein</span> B, and since little <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4122128" conceptname="Apolipoprotein">apolipoprotein</span> B is found in other lipoproteins, this strongly suggests that lovastatin does not merely cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> to be lost from LDL, but also reduces the concentration of circulating LDL particles. In addition, lovastatin can produce increases of variable magnitude in HDL-C, and modestly reduces VLDL-C and plasma triglycerides (TG) (see <a href="#t300">Tables I</a>-<a href="#t302">III</a> under <span class="Italics"><a href="#s5">Clinical Studies</a></span>). The effects of lovastatin on Lp (a), fibrinogen, and certain other independent biochemical risk markers for coronary heart disease are unknown.
</p>
<p>Lovastatin is a specific inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate. The conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate is an early step in the biosynthetic pathway for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lovastatin is a lactone, which is readily hydrolyzed <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> to the corresponding β-hydroxyacid, a potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase is the basis for an assay in pharmacokinetic studies of the β-hydroxyacid metabolites (active inhibitors) and, following base hydrolysis, active plus latent inhibitors (total inhibitors) in plasma following administration of lovastatin.
</p>
<p>Following an oral dose of <span class="Sup">14</span> C-labeled lovastatin in man, 10% of the dose was excreted in urine and 83% in feces. The latter represents absorbed drug equivalents excreted in bile, as well as any unabsorbed drug. Plasma concentrations of total radioactivity (lovastatin plus <span class="Sup">14</span> C-metabolites) peaked at 2 hours and declined rapidly to about 10% of peak by 24 hours postdose. Absorption of lovastatin, estimated relative to an intravenous reference dose, in each of four animal species tested, averaged about 30% of an oral dose. In animal studies, after oral dosing, lovastatin had high selectivity for the liver, where it achieved substantially higher concentrations than in non-target tissues. Lovastatin undergoes extensive first-pass extraction in the liver, its primary site of action, with subsequent excretion of drug equivalents in the bile. As a consequence of extensive hepatic extraction of lovastatin, the availability of drug to the general circulation is low and variable. In a single dose study in four hypercholesterolemic patients, it was estimated that less than 5% of an oral dose of lovastatin reaches the general circulation as active inhibitors. Following administration of lovastatin tablets the coefficient of variation, based on between-subject variability, was approximately 40% for the area under the curve (AUC) of total inhibitory activity in the general circulation.
</p>
<p>Both lovastatin and its β-hydroxyacid metabolite are highly bound (&gt;95%) to human plasma proteins. Animal studies demonstrated that lovastatin crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers.
</p>
<p>The major active metabolites present in human plasma are the β-hydroxyacid of lovastatin, its 6'-hydroxy derivative, and two additional metabolites. Peak plasma concentrations of both active and total inhibitors were attained within 2 to 4 hours of dose administration. While the recommended therapeutic dose range is 10 to 80 mg/day, linearity of inhibitory activity in the general circulation was established by a single dose study employing lovastatin tablet dosages from 60 to as high as 120 mg. With a once-a-day dosing regimen, plasma concentrations of total inhibitors over a dosing interval achieved a steady state between the second and third days of therapy and were about 1.5 times those following a single dose. When lovastatin was given under fasting conditions, plasma concentrations of total inhibitors were on average about two-thirds those found when lovastatin was administered immediately after a standard test meal.
</p>
<p>In a study of patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> (creatinine clearance 10-30 mL/min), the plasma concentrations of total inhibitors after a single dose of lovastatin were approximately two-fold higher than those in healthy volunteers.
</p>
<p>In a study including 16 elderly patients between 70-78 years of age who received lovastatin 80 mg/day, the mean plasma level of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity was increased approximately 45% compared with 18 patients between 18-30 years of age (see <a href="#s27">PRECAUTIONS</a>, <span class="Italics"><a href="#s48">Geriatric Use</a></span> ).
</p>
<p>Although the mechanism is not fully understood, cyclosporine has been shown to increase the AUC of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. The increase in AUC for lovastatin and lovastatin acid is presumably due, in part, to inhibition of CYP3A4.
</p>
<p>The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137275" conceptname="Disorder of muscle">myopathy</span> is increased by high levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity in plasma. Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 can raise the plasma levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity and increase the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137275" conceptname="Disorder of muscle">myopathy</span> (see <a href="#s19">WARNINGS</a>, <span class="Italics"><a href="#s20"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137275" conceptname="Disorder of muscle">Myopathy</span>/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4230337" conceptname="Rhabdomyolysis">Rhabdomyolysis</span></a></span> and <a href="#s27">PRECAUTIONS</a>, <span class="Italics"><a href="#s31">Drug Interactions</a></span> ).
</p>
<p>Lovastatin is a substrate for cytochrome P450 isoform 3A4 (CYP3A4) (see <a href="#s27">PRECAUTIONS</a>, <span class="Italics"><a href="#s31">Drug Interactions</a></span> .) Grapefruit juice contains one or more components that inhibit CYP3A4 and can increase the plasma concentrations of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. In one study **, 10 subjects consumed 200 mL of double-strength grapefruit juice (one can of frozen concentrate diluted with one rather than 3 cans of water) three times daily for 2 days and an additional 200 mL double-strength grapefruit juice together with and 30 and 90 minutes following a single dose of 80 mg lovastatin on the third day. This regimen of grapefruit juice resulted in a mean increase in the serum concentration of lovastatin and its β-hydroxyacid metabolite (as measured by the area under the concentration-time curve) of 15-fold and 5-fold, respectively [as measured using a chemical assay--high performance liquid chromatography.] In a second study, 15 subjects consumed one 8 oz glass of single-strength grapefruit juice (one can of frozen concentrate diluted with 3 cans of water) with breakfast for 3 consecutive days and a single dose of 40 mg lovastatin in the evening of the third day. This regimen of grapefruit juice resulted in a mean increase in the plasma concentration (as measured by the area under the concentration-time curve) of active and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity [using an enzyme inhibition assay both before (for active inhibitors) and after (for total inhibitors) base hydrolysis] of 1.34-fold and 1.36-fold, respectively, and of lovastatin and its β-hydroxyacid metabolite [measured using a chemical assay--liquid chromatography/tandem <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> spectrometry--different from that used in the first ** study] of 1.94-fold and 1.57-fold, respectively. The effect of amounts of grapefruit juice between those used in these two studies on lovastatin pharmacokinetics has not been studied.

<p>Lovastatin has been shown to be highly effective in reducing total-C and LDL-C in heterozygous familial and non-familial forms of primary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437827" conceptname="Pure hypercholesterolemia">hypercholesterolemia</span> and in mixed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432867" conceptname="Hyperlipidemia">hyperlipidemia</span>. A marked response was seen within 2 weeks, and the maximum therapeutic response occurred within 4-6 weeks. The response was maintained during continuation of therapy. Single daily doses given in the evening were more effective than the same dose given in the morning, perhaps because <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> is synthesized mainly at night.
</p>
<p>In multicenter, double-blind studies in patients with familial or non-familial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437827" conceptname="Pure hypercholesterolemia">hypercholesterolemia</span>, lovastatin, administered in doses ranging from 10 mg q.p.m. to 40 mg b.i.d., was compared to placebo. Lovastatin consistently and significantly decreased plasma total-C, LDL-C, total-C/HDL-C ratio and LDL-C/HDL-C ratio. In addition, lovastatin produced increases of variable magnitude in HDL-C, and modestly decreased VLDL-C and plasma TG (see <a href="#t300">Tables I</a> through <a href="#t302">III</a> for dose response results).
</p>
<p>The results of a study in patients with primary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437827" conceptname="Pure hypercholesterolemia">hypercholesterolemia</span> are presented in <a href="#t300">Table I</a>.

Participants were middle-aged and elderly men (ages 45-73) and women (ages 55-73) without symptomatic cardiovascular disease with average to moderately elevated total-C and LDL-C, below average HDL-C, and who were at high risk based on elevated total-C/HDL-C. In addition to age, 63% of the participants had at least one other risk factor (baseline HDL-C &lt;35 mg/dL, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, family history, smoking and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>).
</p>
<p>AFCAPS/TexCaps enrolled 6,605 participants (5,608 men, 997 women) based on the following lipid entry criteria: total-C range of 180-264 mg/dL, LDL-C range of 130-190 mg/dL, HDL-C of ≤45 mg/dL for men and ≤47 mg/dL for women, and TG of ≤400 mg/dL. Participants were treated with standard care, including diet, and either lovastatin 20-40 mg daily (n= 3,304) or placebo (n= 3,301). Approximately 50% of the participants treated with lovastatin were titrated to 40 mg daily when their LDL-C remained &gt;110 mg/dL at the 20-mg starting dose.
</p>
<p>Lovastatin reduced the risk of a first acute major coronary event, the primary efficacy endpoint, by 37% (lovastatin 3.5%, placebo 5.5%; p&lt;0.001; <a href="#f02">Figure 1</a>). A first acute major coronary event was defined as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> (54 participants on lovastatin, 94 on placebo) or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315296" conceptname="Preinfarction syndrome">unstable angina</span> (54 vs. 80) or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4317150" conceptname="Sudden cardiac death">sudden cardiac death</span> (8 vs. 9). Furthermore, among the secondary endpoints, lovastatin reduced the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315296" conceptname="Preinfarction syndrome">unstable angina</span> by 32% (1.8 vs. 2.6%; p=0.023), of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> by 40% (1.7 vs. 2.9%; p=0.002), and of undergoing coronary revascularization procedures (e.g., coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) by 33% (3.2 vs. 4.8%; p=0.001). Trends in risk reduction associated with treatment with lovastatin were consistent across men and women, smokers and non-smokers, hypertensives and non-hypertensives, and older and younger participants. Participants with ≥2 risk factors had risk reductions (RR) in both acute major coronary events (RR 43%) and coronary revascularization procedures (RR 37%). Because there were too few events among those participants with age as their only risk factor in this study, the effect of lovastatin on outcomes could not be adequately assessed in this subgroup.

<p>In the Canadian <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4194618" conceptname="Coronary artery atheroma">Coronary Atherosclerosis</span> Intervention Trial (CCAIT), the effect of therapy with lovastatin on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4194618" conceptname="Coronary artery atheroma">coronary atherosclerosis</span> was assessed by coronary angiography in hyperlipidemic patients. In the randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial, patients were treated with conventional measures (usually diet and 325 mg of aspirin every other day) and either lovastatin 20-80 mg daily or placebo. Angiograms were evaluated at baseline and at two years by computerized quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). Lovastatin significantly slowed the progression of lesions as measured by the mean change per-patient in minimum lumen diameter (the primary endpoint) and percent diameter stenosis, and decreased the proportions of patients categorized with disease progression (33% vs. 50%) and with new lesions (16% vs. 32%).
</p>
<p>In a similarly designed trial, the Monitored <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103842" conceptname="Arteriosclerosis">Atherosclerosis</span> Regression Study (MARS), patients were treated with diet and either lovastatin 80 mg daily or placebo. No statistically significant difference between lovastatin and placebo was seen for the primary endpoint (mean change per patient in percent diameter stenosis of all lesions), or for most secondary QCA endpoints. Visual assessment by angiographers who formed a consensus opinion of overall angiographic change (Global Change Score) was also a secondary endpoint. By this endpoint, significant slowing of disease was seen, with regression in 23% of patients treated with lovastatin compared to 11% of placebo patients.
</p>
<p>In the Familial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103842" conceptname="Arteriosclerosis">Atherosclerosis</span> Treatment Study (FATS), either lovastatin or niacin in combination with a bile acid sequestrant for 2.5 years in hyperlipidemic subjects significantly reduced the frequency of progression and increased the frequency of regression of coronary atherosclerotic lesions by QCA compared to diet and, in some cases, low-dose resin.
</p>
<p>The effect of lovastatin on the progression of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103842" conceptname="Arteriosclerosis">atherosclerosis</span> in the coronary arteries has been corroborated by similar findings in another vasculature. In the Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Progression Study (ACAPS), the effect of therapy with lovastatin on carotid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103842" conceptname="Arteriosclerosis">atherosclerosis</span> was assessed by B-mode ultrasonography in hyperlipidemic patients with early carotid lesions and without known coronary heart disease at baseline. In this double-blind, controlled clinical trial, 919 patients were randomized in a 2 x 2 factorial design to placebo, lovastatin 10-40 mg daily and/or warfarin. Ultrasonograms of the carotid walls were used to determine the change per patient from baseline to three years in mean maximum intimal-medial thickness (IMT) of 12 measured segments. There was a significant regression of carotid lesions in patients receiving lovastatin alone compared to those receiving placebo alone (p=0.001). The predictive value of changes in IMT for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> has not yet been established. In the lovastatin group there was a significant reduction in the number of patients with major cardiovascular events relative to the placebo group (5 vs. 14) and a significant reduction in all-cause mortality (1 vs. 8).
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>There was a high prevalence of baseline <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">lenticular opacities</span> in the patient population included in the early clinical trials with lovastatin. During these trials the appearance of new opacities was noted in both the lovastatin and placebo groups. There was no clinically significant change in visual acuity in the patients who had new opacities reported nor was any patient, including those with opacities noted at baseline, discontinued from therapy because of a decrease in visual acuity.
</p>
<p>A three-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in hypercholesterolemic patients to assess the effect of lovastatin on the human lens demonstrated that there were no clinically or statistically significant differences between the lovastatin and placebo groups in the incidence, type or progression of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">lenticular opacities</span>. There are no controlled clinical data assessing the lens available for treatment beyond three years.

<p>In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 132 boys 10-17 years of age (mean age 12.7 yrs) with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134862" conceptname="Familial hypercholesterolemia">heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia</span> (heFH) were randomized to lovastatin (n=67) or placebo (n=65) for 48 weeks. Inclusion in the study required a baseline LDL-C level between 189 and 500 mg/dL and at least one parent with an LDL-C level &gt;189 mg/dL. The mean baseline LDL-C value was 253.1 mg/dL (range: 171-379 mg/dL) in the lovastatin group compared to 248.2 mg/dL (range 158.5-413.5 mg/dL) in the placebo group. The dosage of lovastatin (once daily in the evening) was 10 mg for the first 8 weeks, 20 mg for the second 8 weeks, and 40 mg thereafter.

<p>After the LDL-C goal has been achieved, if the TG is still ≥200 mg/dL, non-HDL-C (total-C minus HDL-C) becomes a secondary target of therapy. Non-HDL-C goals are set 30 mg/dL higher than LDL-C goals for each risk category.
</p>
<p>At the time of hospitalization for an acute coronary event, consideration can be given to initiating drug therapy at discharge if the LDL-C is ≥130 mg/dL (see NCEP Guidelines above).
</p>

<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4</span>: Lovastatin, like several other inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, is a substrate of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). When lovastatin is used with a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, elevated plasma levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity can increase the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137275" conceptname="Disorder of muscle">myopathy</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4230337" conceptname="Rhabdomyolysis">rhabdomyolysis</span>, particularly with higher doses of lovastatin.

<p>Concomitant use of other medicines labeled as having a potent inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 should be avoided unless the benefits of combined therapy outweigh the increased risk. If treatment with itraconazole, ketoconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin or telithromycin is unavoidable, therapy with lovastatin should be suspended during the course of treatment.

<p><span class="Bold">Persistent increases (to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal) in serum transaminases occurred in 1.9% of adult patients who received lovastatin for at least one year in early clinical trials (see <a href="#s49">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a>).</span> When the drug was interrupted or discontinued in these patients, the transaminase levels usually fell slowly to pretreatment levels. The increases usually appeared 3 to 12 months after the start of therapy with lovastatin, and were not associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span> or other clinical signs or symptoms. There was no evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span>. In the EXCEL study (see <a href="#s3">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a> , <span class="Italics"><a href="#s5">Clinical Studies</a></span> ), the incidence of persistent increases in serum transaminases over 48 weeks was 0.1% for placebo, 0.1% at 20 mg/day, 0.9% at 40 mg/day, and 1.5% at 80 mg/day in patients on lovastatin. However, in post-marketing experience with lovastatin, symptomatic liver disease has been reported rarely at all dosages (see <a href="#s49">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a> ).
</p>
<p>In AFCAPS/TexCAPS, the number of participants with consecutive elevations of either <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4211515" conceptname="Alanine aminotransferase">alanine aminotransferase</span> (ALT) or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4094657" conceptname="Aspartate aminotransferase">aspartate aminotransferase</span> (AST) (&gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal), over a median of 5.1 years of follow-up, was not significantly different between the lovastatin and placebo groups (18 [0.6%] vs. 11 [0.3%]). The starting dose of lovastatin was 20 mg/day; 50% of the lovastatin treated participants were titrated to 40 mg/day at Week 18. Of the 18 participants on lovastatin with consecutive elevations of either ALT or AST, 11 (0.7%) elevations occurred in participants taking 20 mg/day, while 7 (0.4%) elevations occurred in participants titrated to 40 mg/day. Elevated transaminases resulted in discontinuation of 6 (0.2%) participants from therapy in the lovastatin group (n=3,304) and 4 (0.1%) in the placebo group (n=3,301).
</p>
<p>It is recommended that liver function tests be performed prior to initiation of therapy in patients with a history of liver disease, or when otherwise clinically indicated. It is recommend that liver function tests be performed in all patients prior to use of 40mg or more daily and thereafter when clinically indicated. Patients who develop increased transaminase levels should be monitored with a second liver function evaluation to confirm the finding and be followed thereafter with frequent liver function tests until the abnormality (ies) return to normal. Should an increase in AST or ALT of three times the upper limit of normal or greater persist, withdrawal of therapy with lovastatin is recommended.
</p>
<p>The drug should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of lovastatin.
</p>
<p>As with other lipid-lowering agents, moderate (less than three times the upper limit of normal) elevations of serum transaminases have been reported following therapy with lovastatin (see <a href="#s49">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a> ). These changes appeared soon after initiation of therapy with lovastatin, were often transient, were not accompanied by any symptoms and interruption of treatment was not required.

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Lovastatin may elevate creatine phosphokinase and transaminase levels (see <a href="#s19">WARNINGS</a> and <a href="#s49">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a> ). This should be considered in the differential diagnosis of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77670" conceptname="Chest pain">chest pain</span> in a patient on therapy with lovastatin.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>

<p>Lovastatin is less effective in patients with the rare <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134862" conceptname="Familial hypercholesterolemia">homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia</span>, possibly because these patients have no functional LDL receptors.

<p>HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> synthesis and as such might theoretically blunt adrenal and/or gonadal steroid production. Results of clinical trials with drugs in this class have been inconsistent with regard to drug effects on basal and reserve steroid levels. However, clinical studies have shown that lovastatin does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve, and does not reduce basal plasma testosterone concentration. Another HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor has been shown to reduce the plasma testosterone response to HCG. In the same study, the mean testosterone response to HCG was slightly but not significantly reduced after treatment with lovastatin 40 mg daily for 16 weeks in 21 men. The effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on male fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of male patients. The effects, if any, on the pituitary-gonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Patients treated with lovastatin who develop clinical evidence of endocrine dysfunction should be evaluated appropriately. Caution should also be exercised if an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor or other agent used to lower <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> levels is administered to patients also receiving other drugs (e.g., ketoconazole, spironolactone, cimetidine) that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones.

<p>Lovastatin produced optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs in a dose-dependent fashion starting at 60 mg/kg/day, a dose that produced mean plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose (as measured by total enzyme inhibitory activity). Vestibulocochlear Wallerian-like degeneration and retinal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="72712" conceptname="Synovial cyst">ganglion</span> cell chromatolysis were also seen in dogs treated for 14 weeks at 180 mg/kg/day, a dose which resulted in a mean plasma drug level (C <span class="Sub">max</span>) similar to that seen with the 60 mg/kg/day dose.

<p>In a 21-month carcinogenic study in mice, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> in both males and females at 500 mg/kg/day. This dose produced a total plasma drug exposure 3 to 4 times that of humans given the highest recommended dose of lovastatin (drug exposure was measured as total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity in extracted plasma). Tumor increases were not seen at 20 and 100 mg/kg/day, doses that produced drug exposures of 0.3 to 2 times that of humans at the 80 mg/day dose. A statistically significant increase in pulmonary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> was seen in female mice at approximately 4 times the human drug exposure. (Although mice were given 300 times the human dose [HD] on a mg/kg body weight basis, plasma levels of total inhibitory activity were only 4 times higher in mice than in humans given 80 mg of lovastatin.)
</p>
<p>There was an increase in incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4034142" conceptname="Papilloma">papilloma</span> in the non-glandular mucosa of the stomach of mice beginning at exposures of 1 to 2 times that of humans.

</p>
<p>In a 24-month carcinogenicity study in rats, there was a positive dose response relationship for hepatocellular carcinogenicity in males at drug exposures between 2-7 times that of human exposure at 80 mg/day (doses in rats were 5, 30 and 180 mg/kg/day).
</p>
<p>An increased incidence of thyroid neoplasms in rats appears to be a response that has been seen with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.
</p>
<p>A chemically similar drug in this class was administered to mice for 72 weeks at 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg body weight, which resulted in mean serum drug levels approximately 3, 15, and 33 times higher than the mean human serum drug concentration (as total inhibitory activity) after a 40 mg oral dose. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201519" conceptname="Primary malignant neoplasm of liver">Liver carcinomas</span> were significantly increased in high-dose females and mid- and high-dose males, with a maximum incidence of 90 percent in males. The incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> of the liver was significantly increased in mid- and high-dose females.

<p>Drug-related <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438477" conceptname="Atrophy of testis">testicular atrophy</span>, decreased spermatogenesis, spermatocytic degeneration and giant cell formation were seen in dogs starting at 20 mg/kg/day. Similar findings were seen with another drug in this class. No drug-related effects on fertility were found in studies with lovastatin in rats. However, in studies with a similar drug in this class, there was decreased fertility in male rats treated for 34 weeks at 25 mg/kg body weight, although this effect was not observed in a subsequent fertility study when this same dose was administered for 11 weeks (the entire cycle of spermatogenesis, including epididymal maturation). In rats treated with this same reductase inhibitor at 180 mg/kg/day, seminiferous tubule degeneration (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280654" conceptname="Necrosis">necrosis</span> and loss of spermatogenic epithelium) was observed.

<p>Safety in pregnant women has not been established.
</p>
<p>Lovastatin has been shown to produce skeletal malformations in offspring of pregnant mice and rats dosed during gestation at 80 mg/kg/day (affected mouse fetuses/total: 8/307 compared to 4/289 in the control group; affected rat fetuses/total: 6/324 compared to 2/308 in the control group). Female rats dosed before mating through gestation at 80 mg/kg/day also had fetuses with skeletal malformations (affected fetuses/total: 1/152 compared to 0/171 in the control group). The 80 mg/kg/day dose in mice is 7 times the human dose based on body surface area and in rats results in 5 times the human exposure based on AUC. In pregnant rats given doses of 2, 20, or 200 mg/kg/day and treated through lactation, the following effects were observed: neonatal mortality (4.1%, 3.5%, and 46%, respectively, compared to 0.6% in the control group), decreased pup body weights throughout lactation (up to 5%, 8%, and 38%, respectively, below control), supernumerary ribs in dead pups (affected fetuses/total: 0/7, 1/17, and 11/79, respectively, compared to 0/5 in the control group), delays in ossification in dead pups (affected fetuses/total: 0/7, 0/17, and 1/79, respectively, compared to 0/5 in the control group) and delays in pup development (delays in the appearance of an auditory startle response at 200 mg/kg/day and free-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> righting reflexes at 20 and 200 mg/kg/day).
</p>
<p>Direct dosing of neonatal rats by subcutaneous injection with 10 mg/kg/day of the open hydroxyacid form of lovastatin resulted in delayed passive avoidance learning in female rats (mean of 8.3 trials to criterion, compared to 7.3 and 6.4 in untreated and vehicle-treated controls; no effects on retention 1 week later) at exposures 4 times the human systemic exposure at 80 mg/day based on AUC. No effect was seen in male rats. No evidence of malformations was observed when pregnant rabbits were given 5 mg/kg/day (doses equivalent to a human dose of 80 mg/day based on body surface area) or a maternally toxic dose of 15 mg/kg/day (3 times the human dose of 80 mg/day based on body surface area).
</p>
<p>Rare clinical reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been received. However, in an analysis† of greater than 200 prospectively followed pregnancies exposed during the first trimester to lovastatin or another closely related HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, the incidence of congenital anomalies was comparable to that seen in the general population. This number of pregnancies was sufficient to exclude a 3-fold or greater increase in congenital anomalies over the background incidence.
</p>
<p>Maternal treatment with lovastatin may reduce the fetal levels of mevalonate, which is a precursor of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> biosynthesis. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103842" conceptname="Arteriosclerosis">Atherosclerosis</span> is a chronic process, and ordinarily discontinuation of lipidlowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the long-term risk associated with primary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437827" conceptname="Pure hypercholesterolemia">hypercholesterolemia</span>. For these reasons, lovastatin should not be used in women who are pregnant, or can become pregnant (see <a href="#s17">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>). Lovastatin should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. Treatment should be immediately discontinued as soon as pregnancy is recognized.

<p>It is not known whether lovastatin is excreted in human milk. Because a small amount of another drug in this class is excreted in human breast milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women taking lovastatin should not nurse their infants (see <a href="#s17">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>).

<p>A pharmacokinetic study with lovastatin showed the mean plasma level of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity to be approximately 45% higher in elderly patients between 70-78 years of age compared with patients between 18-30 years of age; however, clinical study experience in the elderly indicates that dosage adjustment based on this age-related pharmacokinetic difference is not needed. In the two large clinical studies conducted with lovastatin (EXCEL and AFCAPS/TexCAPS), 21% (3,094/14,850) of patients were ≥65 years of age. Lipid-lowering efficacy with lovastatin was at least as great in elderly patients compared with younger patients, and there were no overall differences in safety over the 20 to 80 mg/day dosage range (see <a href="#s3">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY </a>).

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Lovastatin is generally well tolerated; adverse reactions usually have been mild and transient.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>In Phase III controlled clinical studies involving 613 patients treated with lovastatin, the adverse experience profile was similar to that shown below for the 8,245-patient EXCEL study (see <span class="Italics"><a href="#s51">Expanded Clinical Evaluation of Lovastatin [EXCEL] Study</a></span> ).
</p>
<p>Persistent increases of serum transaminases have been noted (see <a href="#s19">WARNINGS</a>, <span class="Italics"><a href="#s26">Liver Dysfunction</a></span> ). About 11% of patients had elevations of CK levels of at least twice the normal value on one or more occasions. The corresponding values for the control agent cholestyramine was 9 percent. This was attributable to the noncardiac fraction of CK. Large increases in CK have sometimes been reported (see <a href="#s19">WARNINGS</a>, <span class="Italics"><a href="#s20"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137275" conceptname="Disorder of muscle">Myopathy</span>/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4230337" conceptname="Rhabdomyolysis">Rhabdomyolysis</span></a></span> ).

<p>In controlled clinical studies in which lovastatin was administered concomitantly with cholestyramine, no adverse reactions peculiar to this concomitant treatment were observed. The adverse reactions that occurred were limited to those reported previously with lovastatin or cholestyramine. Other lipid-lowering agents were not administered concomitantly with lovastatin during controlled clinical studies. Preliminary data suggests that the addition of gemfibrozil to therapy with lovastatin is not associated with greater reduction in LDL-C than that achieved with lovastatin alone. In uncontrolled clinical studies, most of the patients who have developed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137275" conceptname="Disorder of muscle">myopathy</span> were receiving concomitant therapy with cyclosporine, gemfibrozil or niacin (nicotinic acid). The combined use of lovastatin at doses exceeding 20 mg/day with cyclosporine, gemfibrozil, other fibrates or lipid-lowering doses (≥1 g/day) of niacin should be avoided (see <a href="#s19">WARNINGS</a> , <span class="Italics"><a href="#s20"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137275" conceptname="Disorder of muscle">Myopathy</span>/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4230337" conceptname="Rhabdomyolysis">Rhabdomyolysis</span></a></span> ).

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>After oral administration of lovastatin to mice the median lethal dose observed was &gt;15 g/m <span class="Sup">2</span>.
</p>
<p>Five healthy human volunteers have received up to 200 mg of lovastatin as a single dose without clinically significant adverse experiences. A few cases of accidental overdosage have been reported; no patients had any specific symptoms, and all patients recovered without sequelae. The maximum dose taken was 5-6 g.
</p>
<p>Until further experience is obtained, no specific treatment of overdosage with lovastatin can be recommended.
</p>
<p>The dialyzability of lovastatin and its metabolites in man is not known at present.

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34068-7">

<h1>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>The patient should be placed on a standard <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>-lowering diet before receiving lovastatin and should continue on this diet during treatment with lovastatin (see NCEP Treatment Guidelines for details on dietary therapy). Lovastatin should be given with meals.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The usual recommended starting dose is 20 mg once a day given with the evening meal. The recommended dosing range is 10-80 mg/day in single or two divided doses; the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg/day. Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy (see NCEP Guidelines and <a href="#s3">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a> ). Patients requiring reductions in LDL-C of 20% or more to achieve their goal (see <a href="#s13">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</a>) should be started on 20 mg/day of lovastatin. A starting dose of 10 mg may be considered for patients requiring smaller reductions. Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more.
</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">Cholesterol</span> levels should be monitored periodically and consideration should be given to reducing the dosage of lovastatin if <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> levels <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> significantly below the targeted range.

</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>In patients taking amiodarone or verapamil concomitantly with lovastatin, the dose should not exceed 40 mg/day (see <a href="#s19">WARNINGS</a> , <span class="Italics"><a href="#s20"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137275" conceptname="Disorder of muscle">Myopathy</span>/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4230337" conceptname="Rhabdomyolysis">Rhabdomyolysis</span></a></span> and <a href="#s27">PRECAUTIONS</a> , <span class="Italics"><a href="#s31">Drug Interactions</a></span> , <span class="Italics"><a href="#s34">Other drug interactions</a></span> ).
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The recommended dosing range is 10-40 mg/day; the maximum recommended dose is 40 mg/day. Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy (see NCEP Pediatric Panel Guidelines <span class="Sup">††,
</span><a href="#s3">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a> , and <a href="#s13">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</a> ). Patients requiring reductions in LDL-C of 20% or more to achieve their goal should be started on 20 mg/day of lovastatin.

<p>Lovastatin is effective alone or when used concomitantly with bile-acid sequestrants. If lovastatin is used in combination with gemfibrozil, other fibrates or lipid-lowering doses (≥1g/day) of niacin, the dose of lovastatin should not exceed 20 mg/day (see <a href="#s19">WARNINGS</a>, <span class="Italics"><a href="#s20"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137275" conceptname="Disorder of muscle">Myopathy</span>/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4230337" conceptname="Rhabdomyolysis">Rhabdomyolysis</span></a></span> and <a href="#s27">PRECAUTIONS</a> , <span class="Italics"><a href="#s31">Drug Interactions</a></span> ).
