<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Oxandrin<span class="Sup">Â®</span> oral tablets contain 2.5 mg or 10 mg of the anabolic steroid oxandrolone. Oxandrolone is 17Î²-hydroxy-17Î±-methyl-2-oxa-5Î±-androstan-3-one with the following structural formula:</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Anabolic steroids are synthetic derivatives of testosterone. Certain clinical effects and adverse reactions demonstrate the androgenic properties of this class of drugs. Complete dissociation of anabolic and androgenic effects has not been achieved. The actions of anabolic steroids are therefore similar to those of male sex hormones with the possibility of causing serious disturbances of growth and sexual development if given to young children. Anabolic steroids suppress the gonadotropic functions of the pituitary and may exert a direct effect upon the testes.</p>
<p>During exogenous administration of anabolic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4233066" conceptname="Androgen level">androgens</span>, endogenous testosterone release is inhibited through inhibition of pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH). At large doses, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).</p>
<p>Anabolic steroids have been reported to increase low-density lipoproteins and decrease high-density lipoproteins. These levels revert to normal on discontinuation of treatment.</p>
<p>In a single dose pharmacokinetic study of Oxandrin in elderly subjects, the mean elimination half-life was 13.3 hours. In a previous single dose pharmacokinetic study in younger volunteers, the mean elimination half-life was 10.4 hours. No significant differences between younger and elderly volunteers were found for time to peak, peak plasma concentration or AUC after a single dose of Oxandrin. The correlation between plasma level and therapeutic effect has not been defined.</p>

<h2>Geriatric use</h2>
<p class="First">Oxandrin, at daily doses of 5 mg bid, and 10 mg bid, was evaluated in four clinical trials involving a total of 339 patients with different underlying medical conditions. The maximum duration of treatment was 4 months with the average duration of treatment from 68.5 days to 94.7 days across the studies. A total of 172 elderly patients ( â‰¥ 65 years of age) received Oxandrin treatment. Mean <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span> was similar in those â‰¥ 65 and those &lt; 65 years of age. No significant differences in efficacy were detected between the 5 mg bid and 10 mg bid daily doses. The adverse event profiles were similar between the two age groups although the elderly, particularly in women, had a greater sensitivity to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4125002" conceptname="Idiopathic fluid retention">fluid retention</span> and increases in hepatic transaminases. A single dose pharmacokinetic study in elderly volunteers revealed an increased half-life when compared to younger volunteers. (see <a href="#clinicalpharma">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>) Based on greater sensitivity to drug-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4125002" conceptname="Idiopathic fluid retention">fluid retention</span> and transaminase elevations, a lower dose is recommended in the elderly (see  <a href="#dosage">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34075-2">
<a name="prelab"></a><a name="section-8.4"></a><p></p>
<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">Women with disseminated breast carcinoma should have frequent determination of urine and serum calcium levels during the course of therapy. (See <a href="#warning">WARNINGS</a>).</p>
<p>Because of the hepatotoxicity associated with the use of 17-alpha-alkylated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4233066" conceptname="Androgen level">androgens</span>, liver function tests should be obtained periodically.</p>
<p>Periodic (every 6 months) x-ray examinations of bone age should be made during treatment of children to determine the rate of bone maturation and the effects of androgen therapy on the epiphyseal centers.</p>
<p>Androgenic anabolic steroids have been reported to increase low-density lipoproteins and decrease high-density lipoproteins. Therefore, caution is required when administering these agents to patients with a history of cardiovascular disease or who are at risk for cardiovascular disease. Serum determination of lipid levels should be performed periodically and therapy adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>Hemoglobin and hematocrit should be checked periodically for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435790" conceptname="Secondary polycythemia">polycythemia</span> in patients who are receiving high doses of anabolic steroids.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-8.5.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Anticoagulants</h3>
<p class="First">Anabolic steroids may increase sensitivity to oral anticoagulants. Dosage of the anticoagulant may have to be decreased in order to maintain desired <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time. Patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy require close monitoring, especially when anabolic steroids are started or stopped.</p>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-8.5.1.1"></a><p></p>
<h4>Warfarin</h4>
<p class="First">A multidose study of oxandrolone, given as 5 or 10 mg bid in 15 healthy subjects concurrently treated with warfarin, resulted in a mean increase in S-warfarin half-life from 26 to 48 hours and AUC from 4.55 to 12.08 ng<span class="Sup">*</span>hr/mL; similar increases in R-warfarin half-life and AUC were also detected. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75004" conceptname="Frank hematuria">Microscopic hematuria</span> (9/15) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4311406" conceptname="Bleeding gums">gingival bleeding</span> (1/15) were also observed. A 5.5-fold decrease in the mean warfarin dose from 6.13 mg/day to 1.13 mg/day (approximately 80-85% reduction of warfarin dose), was necessary to maintain a target INR of 1.5. When oxandrolone therapy is initiated in a patient already receiving treatment with warfarin, the INR or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time (PT) should be monitored closely and the dose of warfarin adjusted as necessary until a stable target INR or PT has been achieved. Furthermore, in patients receiving both drugs, careful monitoring of the INR or PT, and adjustment of the warfarin dosage if indicated are recommended when the oxandrolone dose is changed or discontinued. Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of occult <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>.</p>

<h2>Nursing mothers</h2>
<p class="First">It is not known whether anabolic steroids are excreted in human milk.

<h2>Pediatric use</h2>
<p class="First">Anabolic agents may accelerate epiphyseal maturation more rapidly than linear growth in children and the effect may continue for 6 months after the drug has been stopped. Therefore, therapy should be monitored by x-ray studies at 6-month intervals in order to avoid the risk of compromising adult height. Androgenic anabolic steroid therapy should be used very cautiously in children and only by specialists who are aware of the effects on bone maturation (See <a href="#warning">WARNINGS</a>).</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Therapy with anabolic steroids is adjunctive to and not a replacement for conventional therapy. The duration of therapy with Oxandrin (oxandrolone)Â will depend on the response of the patient and the possible appearance of adverse reactions. Therapy should be intermittent.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Adults: </span>The response of individuals to anabolic steroids varies. The daily adult dosage is 2.5 mg to 20 mg given in 2 to 4 divided doses. The desired response may be achieved with as little as 2.5 mg or as much as 20 mg daily. A course of therapy of 2 to 4 weeks is usually adequate. This may be repeated intermittently as indicated.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Children: </span>For children the total daily dosage of Oxandrin is â‰¤0.1 mg per kilogram body weight or â‰¤0.045 mg per pound of body weight. This may be repeated intermittently as indicated.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Geriatric Use:</span>
							 Recommended dose for geriatric patients is 5 mg bid.</p>
