<p>ZYLOPRIM is known chemically as 1,5-dihydro-4<span class="Italics">H</span>-pyrazolo [3,4-<span class="Italics">d</span>]pyrimidin-4-one. It is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor which is administered orally. Each scored white tablet contains 100 mg allopurinol and the inactive ingredients lactose, magnesium stearate, potato starch, and povidone. Each scored peach tablet contains 300 mg allopurinol and the inactive ingredients corn starch, FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6 Lake, lactose, magnesium stearate, and povidone. Its solubility in water at 37°C is 80.0 mg/dL and is greater in an alkaline solution.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">ZYLOPRIM acts on purine catabolism, without disrupting the biosynthesis of purines. It reduces the production of uric acid by inhibiting the biochemical reactions immediately preceding its formation.</p>
<p> ZYLOPRIM is a structural analogue of the natural purine base, hypoxanthine. It is an inhiboitor of xanthine oxidase, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine and of xanthine to uric acid, the end product of purine metabolism in man. ZYLOPRIM is metabolized to the corresponding xanthine analogue, oxipurinol (alloxanthine), which also is an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase.</p>
<div class="Figure">
<a name="f02"></a><img alt="Figure" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=342832b5-1a32-4bea-bc49-ab0fd152154e&amp;name=zyloprim-tablets-02.jpg">
</div>
<p> It has been shown that reutilization of both hypoxanthine and xanthine for nucleotide and nucleic acid synthesis is markedly enhanced when their oxidations are inhibited by ZYLOPRIM and oxipurinol. This reutilization does not disrupt normal nucleic acid anabolism, however, because feedback inhibition is an integral part of purine biosynthesis. As a result of xanthine oxidase inhibition, the serum concentration of hypoxanthine plus xanthine in patients receiving ZYLOPRIM for treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4147761" conceptname="Hyperuricemia">hyperuricemia</span> is usually in the range of 0.3 to 0.4 mg/dL compared to a normal level of approximately 0.15 mg/dL. A maximum of 0.9 mg/dL of these oxypurines has been reported when the serum urate was lowered to less than 2 mg/dL by high doses of ZYLOPRIM. These values are far below the saturation levels at which point their precipitation would be expected to occur (above 7 mg/dL).</p>
<p> The renal clearance of hypoxanthine and xanthine is at least 10 times greater than that of uric acid. The increased xanthine and hypoxanthine in the urine have not been accompanied by problems of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201620" conceptname="Kidney stone">nephrolithiasis</span>. Xanthine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4188213" conceptname="Crystalluria">crystalluria</span> has been reported in only three patients. Two of the patients had Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, which is characterized by excessive uric acid production combined with a deficiency of the enzyme, hypoxanthineguanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRTase). This enzyme is required for the conversion of hypoxanthine, xanthine, and guanine to their respective nucleotides. The third patient had lymphosarcoma and produced an extremely large amount of uric acid because of rapid cell lysis during chemotherapy.</p>
<p> ZYLOPRIM is approximately 90% absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Peak plasma levels generally occur at 1.5 hours and 4.5 hours for ZYLOPRIM and oxipurinol respectively, and after a single oral dose of 300 mg ZYLOPRIM, maximum plasma levels of about 3 mcg/mL of ZYLOPRIM and 6.5 mcg/mL of oxipurinol are produced.</p>
<p> Approximately 20% of the ingested ZYLOPRIM is excreted in the feces. Because of its rapid oxidation to oxipurinol and a renal clearance rate approximately that of glomerular filtration rate, ZYLOPRIM has a plasma half-life of about 1 to 2 hours. Oxipurinol, however, has a longer plasma half-life (approximately 15 hours) and therefore effective xanthine oxidase inhibition is maintained over a 24-hour period with single daily doses of ZYLOPRIM. Whereas ZYLOPRIM is cleared essentially by glomerular filtration, oxipurinol is reabsorbed in the kidney tubules in a manner similar to the reabsorption of uric acid.</p>
<p> The clearance of oxipurinol is increased by uricosuric drugs, and as a consequence, the addition of a uricosuric agent reduces to some degree the inhibition of xanthine oxidase by oxipurinol and increases to some degree the urinary excretion of uric acid. In practice, the net effect of such combined therapy may be useful in some patients in achieving minimum serum uric acid levels provided the total urinary uric acid load does not exceed the competence of the patient's renal function.</p>
<p> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4147761" conceptname="Hyperuricemia">Hyperuricemia</span> may be primary, as in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440674" conceptname="Gout">gout</span>, or secondary to diseases such as acute and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140057" conceptname="Chronic leukemia">chronic leukemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135214" conceptname="Polycythemia vera">polycythemia vera</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437233" conceptname="Multiple myeloma">multiple myeloma</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span>. It may occur with the use of diuretic agents, during renal dialysis, in the presence of renal damage, during <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443082" conceptname="Starvation">starvation</span> or reducing diets, and in the treatment of neoplastic disease where rapid resolution of tissue <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">masses</span> may occur. Asymptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4147761" conceptname="Hyperuricemia">hyperuricemia</span> is not an indication for treatment with ZYLOPRIM (see <a href="#s4">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</a>).</p>
<p> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440674" conceptname="Gout">Gout</span> is a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436670" conceptname="Metabolic disease">metabolic disorder</span> which is characterized by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4147761" conceptname="Hyperuricemia">hyperuricemia</span> and resultant deposition of monosodium urate in the tissues, particularly the joints and kidneys. The etiology of this <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4147761" conceptname="Hyperuricemia">hyperuricemia</span> is the overproduction of uric acid in relation to the patient's ability to excrete it. If progressive deposition of urates is to be arrested or reversed, it is necessary to reduce the serum uric acid level below the saturation point to suppress urate precipitation.</p>
<p> Administration of ZYLOPRIM generally results in a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> in both serum and urinary uric acid within 2 to 3 days. The degree of this decrease can be manipulated almost at will since it is dose-dependent. A week or more of treatment with ZYLOPRIM may be required before its full effects are manifested; likewise, uric acid may return to pretreatment levels slowly (usually after a period of 7 to 10 days following cessation of therapy). This reflects primarily the accumulation and slow clearance of oxipurinol. In some patients a dramatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> in urinary uric acid excretion may not occur, particularly in those with severe tophaceous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440674" conceptname="Gout">gout</span>. It has been postulated that this may be due to the mobilization of urate from tissue deposits as the serum uric acid level begins to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span>.</p>
<p> The action of ZYLOPRIM differs from that of uricosuric agents, which lower the serum uric acid level by increasing urinary excretion of uric acid. ZYLOPRIM reduces both the serum and urinary uric acid levels by inhibiting the formation of uric acid. The use of ZYLOPRIM to block the formation of urates avoids the hazard of increased renal excretion of uric acid posed by uricosuric drugs.</p>
<p> ZYLOPRIM can substantially reduce serum and urinary uric acid levels in previously refractory patients even in the presence of renal damage serious enough to render uricosuric drugs virtually ineffective. Salicylates may be given conjointly for their antirheumatic effect without compromising the action of ZYLOPRIM. This is in contrast to the nullifying effect of salicylates on uricosuric drugs.</p>
<p> ZYLOPRIM also inhibits the enzymatic oxidation of mercaptopurine, the sulfur-containing analogue of hypoxanthine, to 6-thiouric acid. This oxidation, which is catalyzed by xanthine oxidase, inactivates mercaptopurine. Hence, the inhibition of such oxidation by ZYLOPRIM may result in as much as a 75% reduction in the therapeutic dose requirement of mercaptopurine when the two compounds are given together.</p>

<p class="First">ZYLOPRIM SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED AT THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">SKIN RASH</span> OR OTHER SIGNS WHICH MAY INDICATE AN <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">ALLERGIC REACTION</span>. In some instances a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">skin rash</span> may be followed by more severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span> such as exfoliative, urticarial, and purpuric lesions, as well as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="141651" conceptname="Stevens-Johnson syndrome">Stevens-Johnson syndrome</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="132702" conceptname="Erythema multiforme">erythema multiforme exudativum</span>), and/or generalized <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137275" conceptname="Vasculitis">vasculitis</span>, irreversible hepatotoxicity, and, on rare occasions, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.</p>
<p> In patients receiving PURINETHOL<span class="Sup">®</span> (mercaptopurine) or IMURAN<span class="Sup">®</span> (azathioprine), the concomitant administration of 300 to 600 mg of ZYLOPRIM per day will require a reduction in dose to approximately one-third to one-fourth of the usual dose of mercaptopurine or azathioprine. Subsequent adjustment of doses of mercaptopurine or azathioprine should be made on the basis of therapeutic response and the appearance of toxic effects (see <a href="#s3">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>).</p>
<p> A few cases of reversible clinical hepatotoxicity have been noted in patients taking ZYLOPRIM, and in some patients, asymptomatic rises in serum alkaline phosphatase or serum transaminase have been observed. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">anorexia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span> develop in patients on ZYLOPRIM, evaluation of liver function should be part of their diagnostic workup.

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34072-9">
<a name="s8"></a><a name="section-7.1"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">General:</span> An increase in acute attacks of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440674" conceptname="Gout">gout</span> has been reported during the early stages of administration of ZYLOPRIM , even when normal or subnormal serum uric acid levels have been attained. Accordingly, maintenance doses of colchicine generally should be given prophylactically when ZYLOPRIM is begun. In addition, it is recommended that the patient start with a low dose of ZYLOPRIM (100 mg daily) and increase at weekly intervals by 100 mg until a serum uric acid level of 6 mg/dL or less is attained but without exceeding the maximum recommended dose (800 mg per day). The use of colchicine or anti-inflammatory agents may be required to suppress gouty attacks in some cases. The attacks usually become shorter and less severe after several months of therapy. The mobilization of urates from tissue deposits which cause fluctuations in the serum uric acid levels may be a possible explanation for these episodes. Even with adequate therapy with ZYLOPRIM, it may require several months to deplete the uric acid pool sufficiently to achieve control of the acute attacks.</p>
<p> A fluid intake sufficient to yield a daily urinary output of at least 2 liters and the maintenance of a neutral or, preferably, slightly alkaline urine are desirable to (1) avoid the theoretical possibility of formation of xanthine calculi under the influence of therapy with ZYLOPRIM and (2) help prevent renal precipitation of urates in patients receiving concomitant uricosuric agents.</p>
<p> Some patients with pre-existing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span> or poor urate clearance have shown a rise in BUN during administration of ZYLOPRIM. Although the mechanism responsible for this has not been established, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> should be carefully observed during the early stages of administration of ZYLOPRIM and the dosage decreased or the drug withdrawn if increased abnormalities in renal function appear and persist.</p>
<p> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal failure</span> in association with administration of ZYLOPRIM has been observed among patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4147761" conceptname="Hyperuricemia">hyperuricemia</span> secondary to neoplastic diseases. Concurrent conditions such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437233" conceptname="Multiple myeloma">multiple myeloma</span> and congestive myocardial disease were present among those patients whose renal dysfunction increased after ZYLOPRIM was begun. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal failure</span> is also frequently associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192276" conceptname="Chronic gouty nephropathy">gouty nephropathy</span> and rarely with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span> associated with ZYLOPRIM. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168705" conceptname="Albuminuria">Albuminuria</span> has been observed among patients who developed clinical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440674" conceptname="Gout">gout</span> following <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312358" conceptname="Chronic glomerulonephritis">chronic glomerulonephritis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4056021" conceptname="Chronic pyelitis">chronic pyelonephritis</span>.</p>
<p> Patients with decreased renal function require lower doses of ZYLOPRIM than those with normal renal function. Lower than recommended doses should be used to initiate therapy in any patients with decreased renal function and they should be observed closely during the early stages of administration of ZYLOPRIM . In patients with severely <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> or decreased urate clearance, the half-life of oxipurinol in the plasma is greatly prolonged. Therefore, a dose of 100 mg per day or 300 mg twice a week, or perhaps less, may be sufficient to maintain adequate xanthine oxidase inhibition to reduce serum urate levels.</p>
<p> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4145241" conceptname="Bone marrow depression">Bone marrow depression</span> has been reported in patients receiving ZYLOPRIM, most of whom received concomitant drugs with the potential for causing this reaction. This has occurred as early as 6 weeks to as long as 6 years after the initiation of therapy of ZYLOPRIM . Rarely, a patient may develop varying degrees of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4145241" conceptname="Bone marrow depression">bone marrow depression</span>, affecting one or more cell lines, while receiving ZYLOPRIM alone.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Information for Patients:</span> Patients should be informed of the following:</p>
<p>(1) They should be cautioned to discontinue ZYLOPRIM and to consult their physician immediately at the first sign of a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">skin rash</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197684" conceptname="Dysuria">painful urination</span>, blood in the urine, irritation of the eyes, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span> of the lips or mouth. (2) They should be reminded to continue drug therapy prescribed for gouty attacks since optimal benefit of ZYLOPRIM may be delayed for 2 to 6 weeks. (3) They should be encouraged to increase fluid intake during therapy to prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201620" conceptname="Kidney stone">renal stones</span>. (4) If a single dose of ZYLOPRIM is occasionally forgotten, there is no need to double the dose at the next scheduled time. (5) There may be certain risks associated with the concomitant use of ZYLOPRIM and dicumarol, sulfinpyrazone, mercaptopurine, azathioprine, ampicillin, amoxicillin, and thiazide diuretics, and they should follow the instructions of their physician.

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Laboratory Tests:</span> The correct dosage and schedule for maintaining the serum uric acid within the normal range is best determined by using the serum uric acid as an index.</p>
<p> In patients with pre-existing liver disease, periodic liver function tests are recommended during the early stages of therapy (see <a href="#s6">WARNINGS</a>).</p>
<p> ZYLOPRIM and its primary active metabolite, oxipurinol, are eliminated by the kidneys; therefore, changes in renal function have a profound effect on dosage. In patients with decreased renal function or who have concurrent illnesses which can affect renal function such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus, periodic laboratory parameters of renal function, particularly BUN and serum creatinine or creatinine clearance, should be performed and the patient's dosage of ZYLOPRIM reassessed.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions:</span> In patients receiving PURINETHOL (mercaptopurine) or IMURAN (azathioprine), the concomitant administration of 300 to 600 mg of ZYLOPRIM per day will require a reduction in dose to approximately one third to one fourth of the usual dose of mercaptopurine or azathioprine. Subsequent adjustment of doses of mercaptopurine or azathioprine should be made on the basis of therapeutic response and the appearance of toxic effects (see <a href="#s3">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>).</p>
<p> It has been reported that ZYLOPRIM prolongs the half-life of the anticoagulant, dicumarol. The clinical basis of this drug interaction has not been established but should be noted when ZYLOPRIM is given to patients already on dicumarol therapy.</p>
<p> Since the excretion of oxipurinol is similar to that of urate, uricosuric agents, which increase the excretion of urate, are also likely to increase the excretion of oxipurinol and thus lower the degree of inhibition of xanthine oxidase. The concomitant administration of uricosuric agents and ZYLOPRIM has been associated with a decrease in the excretion of oxypurines (hypoxanthine and xanthine) and an increase in urinary uric acid excretion compared with that observed with ZYLOPRIM alone. Although clinical evidence to date has not demonstrated renal precipitation of oxypurines in patients either on ZYLOPRIM alone or in combination with uricosuric agents, the possibility should be kept in mind.</p>
<p> The reports that the concomitant use of ZYLOPRIM and thiazide diuretics may contribute to the enhancement of allopurinol toxicity in some patients have been reviewed in an attempt to establish a cause-and-effect relationship and a mechanism of causation. Review of these case reports indicates that the patients were mainly receiving thiazide diuretics for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> and that tests to rule out decreased renal function secondary to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="195556" conceptname="Hypertensive heart AND renal disease">hypertensive nephropathy</span> were not often performed. In those patients in whom <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> was documented, however, the recommendation to lower the dose of ZYLOPRIM was not followed. Although a causal mechanism and a cause-and-effect relationship have not been established, current evidence suggests that renal function should be monitored in patients on thiazide diuretics and ZYLOPRIM even in the absence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span>, and dosage levels should be even more conservatively adjusted in those patients on such combined therapy if diminished renal function is detected.</p>
<p> An increase in the frequency of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">skin rash</span> has been reported among patients receiving ampicillin or amoxicillin concurrently with ZYLOPRIM compared to patients who are not receiving both drugs. The cause of the reported association has not been established.</p>
<p> Enhanced bone marrow suppression by cyclophosphamide and other cytotoxic agents has been reported among patients with neoplastic disease, except <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315497" conceptname="Subacute leukemia">leukemia</span>, in the presence of ZYLOPRIM. However, in a well-controlled study of patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> on combination therapy, ZYLOPRIM did not increase the marrow toxicity of patients treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, bleomycin, procarbazine, and/or mechlorethamine.</p>
<p> Tolbutamide's conversion to inactive metabolites has been shown to be catalyzed by xanthine oxidase from rat liver. The clinical significance, if any, of these observations is unknown.</p>
<p> Chlorpropamide's plasma half-life may be prolonged by ZYLOPRIM, since ZYLOPRIM and chlorpropamide may compete for excretion in the renal tubule.

<p> Rare reports indicate that cyclosporine levels may be increased during concomitant treatment with ZYLOPRIM. Monitoring of cyclosporine levels and possible adjustment of cyclosporine dosage should be considered when these drugs are co-administered.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Teratogenic Effects:</span> Pregnancy Category C. Reproductive studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to twenty times the usual human dose (5 mg/kg per day), and it was concluded that there was no impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to allopurinol. There is a published report of a study in pregnant mice given 50 or 100 mg/kg allopurinol intraperitoneally on gestation days 10 or 13. There were increased numbers of dead fetuses in dams given 100 mg/kg allopurinol but not in those given 50 mg/kg. There were increased numbers of external malformations in fetuses at both doses of allopurinol on gestation day 10 and increased numbers of skeletal malformations in fetuses at both doses on gestation day 13. It cannot be determined whether this represented a fetal effect or an effect secondary to maternal toxicity. There are, however, no adequate or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p>
<p>  Experience with ZYLOPRIM during human pregnancy has been limited partly because women of reproductive age rarely require treatment with ZYLOPRIM. There are two unpublished reports and one published paper of women giving birth to normal offspring after receiving ZYLOPRIM during pregnancy.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Data upon which the following estimates of incidence of adverse reactions are made are derived from experiences reported in the literature, unpublished clinical trials and voluntary reports since marketing of ZYLOPRIM (allopurinol) began. Past experience suggested that the most frequent event following the initiation of allopurinol treatment was an increase in acute attacks of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440674" conceptname="Gout">gout</span> (average 6% in early studies). An analysis of current usage suggests that the incidence of acute gouty attacks has diminished to less than 1%. The explanation for this decrease has not been determined but may be due in part to initiating therapy more gradually (see <a href="#s7">PRECAUTIONS</a> and <a href="#s19">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>
<p> The most frequent adverse reaction to ZYLOPRIM is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">skin rash</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089139" conceptname="Skin reaction">Skin reactions</span> can be severe and sometimes fatal. Therefore, treatment with ZYLOPRIM should be discontinued immediately if a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> develops (see <a href="#s6">WARNINGS</a>). Some patients with the most severe reaction also had <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4190045" conceptname="Rigor">chills</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77074" conceptname="Joint pain">arthralgias</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185719" conceptname="Cholestatic jaundice syndrome">cholestatic jaundice</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302954" conceptname="Disorder characterized by eosinophilia">eosinophilia</span> and mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438398" conceptname="Leukocytosis">leukocytosis</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435224" conceptname="Leukopenia">leukopenia</span>. Among 55 patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440674" conceptname="Gout">gout</span> treated with ZYLOPRIM for 3 to 34 months (average greater than 1 year) and followed prospectively, Rundles observed that 3% of patients developed a type of drug reaction which was predominantly a pruritic maculopapular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">skin eruption</span>, sometimes scaly or exfoliative. However, with current usage, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089139" conceptname="Skin reaction">skin reactions</span> have been observed less frequently than 1%. The explanation for this decrease is not obvious. The incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">skin rash</span> may be increased in the presence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>. The frequency of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">skin rash</span> among patients receiving ampicillin or amoxicillin concurrently with ZYLOPRIM has been reported to be increased (see <a href="#s7">PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>

<p class="First">Massive overdosing or acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">poisoning</span> by ZYLOPRIM has not been reported.</p>
<p> In mice, the 50% lethal dose (LD<span class="Sub">50</span>) is 160 mg/kg given intraperitoneally (IP) with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> delayed up to 5 days and 700 mg/kg orally (PO) (approximately 140 times the usual human dose) with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> delayed up to 3 days.

<p> In the management of overdosage there is no specific antidote for ZYLOPRIM. There has been no clinical experience in the management of a patient who has taken massive amounts of ZYLOPRIM.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">The dosage of ZYLOPRIM to accomplish full control of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440674" conceptname="Gout">gout</span> and to lower serum uric acid to normal or near-normal levels varies with the severity of the disease. The average is 200 to 300 mg/day for patients with mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440674" conceptname="Gout">gout</span> and 400 to 600 mg/day for those with moderately severe tophaceous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440674" conceptname="Gout">gout</span>. The appropriate dosage may be administered in divided doses or as a single equivalent dose with the 300-mg tablet. Dosage requirements in excess of 300 mg should be administered in divided doses. The minimal effective dosage is 100 to 200 mg daily and the maximal recommended dosage is 800 mg daily. To reduce the possibility of flare-up of acute gouty attacks, it is recommended that the patient start with a low dose of ZYLOPRIM (100 mg daily) and increase at weekly intervals by 100 mg until a serum uric acid level of 6 mg/dL or less is attained but without exceeding the maximal recommended dosage.</p>
<p> Normal serum urate levels are usually achieved in 1 to 3 weeks. The upper limit of normal is about 7 mg/dL for men and postmenopausal women and 6 mg/dL for premenopausal women. Too much reliance should not be placed on a single serum uric acid determination since, for technical reasons, estimation of uric acid may be difficult. By selecting the appropriate dosage and, in certain patients, using uricosuric agents concurrently, it is possible to reduce serum uric acid to normal or, if desired, to as low as 2 to 3 mg/dL and keep it there indefinitely.</p>
<p> While adjusting the dosage of ZYLOPRIM in patients who are being treated with colchicine and/or anti-inflammatory agents, it is wise to continue the latter therapy until serum uric acid has been normalized and there has been freedom from acute gouty attacks for several months.</p>
<p> In transferring a patient from a uricosuric agent to ZYLOPRIM, the dose of the uricosuric agent should be gradually reduced over a period of several weeks and the dose of ZYLOPRIM gradually increased to the required dose needed to maintain a normal serum uric acid level.</p>
<p> It should also be noted that ZYLOPRIM is generally better tolerated if taken following meals. A fluid intake sufficient to yield a daily urinary output of at least 2 liters and the maintenance of a neutral or, preferably, slightly alkaline urine are desirable.</p>
<p> Since ZYLOPRIM and its metabolites are primarily eliminated only by the kidney, accumulation of the drug can occur in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span>, and the dose of ZYLOPRIM should consequently be reduced. With a creatinine clearance of 10 to 20 mL/min, a daily dosage of 200 mg of ZYLOPRIM is suitable. When the creatinine clearance is less than 10 mL/min, the daily dosage should not exceed 100 mg. With extreme <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (creatinine clearance less than 3 mL/min) the interval between doses may also need to be lengthened.</p>
<p> The correct size and frequency of dosage for maintaining the serum uric acid just within the normal range is best determined by using the serum uric acid level as an index.</p>
<p> For the prevention of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4128219" conceptname="Urate nephropathy">uric acid nephropathy</span> during the vigorous therapy of neoplastic disease, treatment with 600 to 800 mg daily for 2 or 3 days is advisable together with a high fluid intake. Otherwise similar considerations to the above recommendations for treating patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440674" conceptname="Gout">gout</span> govern the regulation of dosage for maintenance purposes in secondary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4147761" conceptname="Hyperuricemia">hyperuricemia</span>.</p>
<p> The dose of ZYLOPRIM recommended for management of recurrent calcium oxalate stones in hyperuricosuric patients is 200 to 300 mg/day in divided doses or as the single equivalent. This dose may be adjusted up or down depending upon the resultant control of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4057743" conceptname="Hyperuricuria">hyperuricosuria</span> based upon subsequent 24 hour urinary urate determinations. Clinical experience suggests that patients with recurrent calcium oxalate stones may also benefit from dietary changes such as the reduction of animal protein, sodium, refined sugars, oxalate-rich foods, and excessive calcium intake, as well as an increase in oral fluids and dietary fiber.</p>
<p> Children, 6 to 10 years of age, with secondary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4147761" conceptname="Hyperuricemia">hyperuricemia</span> associated with malignancies may be given 300 mg ZYLOPRIM daily while those under 6 years are generally given 150 mg daily. The response is evaluated after approximately 48 hours of therapy and a dosage adjustment is made if necessary.</p>
