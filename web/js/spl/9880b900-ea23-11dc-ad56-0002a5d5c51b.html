<h2>Severe Combined <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433740" conceptname="Immunodeficiency disorder">Immunodeficiency</span> Disease Associated with ADA Deficiency</h2>
<p class="First">Severe combined <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433740" conceptname="Immunodeficiency disorder">immunodeficiency</span> disease (SCID) associated with a deficiency of ADA is a rare, inherited, and often fatal disease. In the absence of the ADA enzyme, the purine substrates adenosine and 2â€²-deoxyadenosine accumulate, causing metabolic abnormalities that are directly toxic to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span>.</p>
<p>The immune deficiency can be cured by bone marrow transplantation. When a suitable bone marrow donor is unavailable or when bone marrow transplantation fails, non-selective replacement of the ADA enzyme has been provided by periodic irradiated red blood cell transfusions. However, transmission of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440029" conceptname="Viral disease">viral infections</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4246084" conceptname="Iron overload">iron overload</span> are serious risks associated with irradiated red blood cell transfusions, and relatively few ADA deficient patients have benefitted from chronic transfusion therapy.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection provides specific and direct replacement of the deficient enzyme, but will not benefit patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433740" conceptname="Immunodeficiency disorder">immunodeficiency</span> due to other causes.</p>
<p>In patients with ADA deficiency, rigorous adherence to a schedule of <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection administration can eliminate the toxic metabolites of ADA deficiency and result in improved immune function. It is imperative that treatment with <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection be carefully monitored by measurement of the level of ADA activity in plasma. Monitoring of the level of deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) in erythrocytes is also helpful in determining that the dose of <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection is adequate.</p>

<h2>Actions</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection provides specific replacement of the deficient enzyme.</p>
<p>In the absence of the enzyme ADA, the purine substrates adenosine, 2â€²-deoxyadenosine and their metabolites are toxic to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span>. The direct action of <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection is the correction of these metabolic abnormalities. Improvement in immune function and diminished frequency of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4247535" conceptname="Opportunistic infectious disease">opportunistic infections</span> compared with the natural history of combined <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433740" conceptname="Immunodeficiency disorder">immunodeficiency</span> due to ADA deficiency only occurs after metabolic abnormalities are corrected. There is a lag between the correction of the metabolic abnormalities and improved immune function. This period of time is variable, and has been reported to be from a few weeks to as long as 6 months. In contrast to the natural history of combined <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433740" conceptname="Immunodeficiency disorder">immunodeficiency</span> disease due to ADA deficiency, a trend toward diminished frequency of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4247535" conceptname="Opportunistic infectious disease">opportunistic infections</span> and fewer complications of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> has occurred in patients receiving <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">The pharmacokinetics and biochemical effects of <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection have been studied in six children ranging in age from 6 weeks to 12 years with SCID associated with ADA deficiency.</p>
<p>After the intramuscular injection of <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection, peak plasma levels of ADA activity were reached 2 to 3 days following administration. The plasma elimination half-life of ADA following the administration of <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection was variable, even for the same child. The range was 3 to &gt; 6 days. Following weekly injections of <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection at 15 U/kg, the average trough level of ADA activity in plasma was between 20 and 25 Î¼mol/hr/mL.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="i4i_section_id_a2855fdd-da28-4333-b7f3-1723c8688904"></a><a name="section-2.4"></a><p></p>
<h2>Biochemical Effects</h2>
<p class="First">The changes in red blood cell deoxyadenosine nucleotide (dATP) and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHase) have been evaluated. In patients with ADA deficiency, inadequate elimination of 2â€²-deoxyadenosine caused a marked elevation in dATP and a decrease in SAHase level in red blood cells. Prior to treatment with <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection, the levels of dATP in the red blood cells ranged from 0.056 to 0.899 Î¼mol/mL of erythrocytes. After 2 months of maintenance treatment with <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection, the levels decreased to 0.007 to 0.015 Î¼mol/mL. The normal value of dATP is below 0.001 Î¼mol/mL. In the same period of time, the levels of SAHase increased from the pretreatment range of 0.09 to 0.22 nmol/hr/mg protein to a range of 2.37 to 5.16 nmol/hr/mg protein. The normal value for SAHase is 4.18 Â± 1.9 nmol/hr/mg protein.</p>
<p>The optimal dosage and schedule of administration of <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection should be established for each patient, based on monitoring of plasma ADA activity levels (trough levels before maintenance injection), biochemical markers of ADA deficiency (primarily red cell dATP content), and parameters of immune function. Since improvement in immune function follows correction of metabolic abnormalities, maintenance dosage in individual patients should be aimed at achieving the following biochemical goals: 1) maintain plasma ADA activity (trough levels) in the range of 15-35 Î¼mol/hr/mL (assayed at 37Â°C); and 2) decline in erythrocyte dATP to â‰¤ 0.005-0.015 Âµmol/mL packed erythrocytes, or â‰¤ 1% of the total erythrocyte adenine nucleotide (ATP + dATP) content, with a normal ATP level, as measured in a pre-injection sample.</p>
<p>In vitro immunologic data (lymphocyte response to mitogens and lymphocyte surface antigens) were obtained, but their clinical significance is unknown. Prior to treatment with <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection, immune status was significantly below normal, as indicated by &lt; 10% of normal mitogen responses and circulating mononuclear cells bearing T-cell surface antigens. These parameters improved, though not always to normal, within 2 to 6 months of therapy.</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Any laboratory or clinical indication of a decrease in potency of <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection should be reported immediately by telephone to Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Telephone 1-866-792-5172.</p>
<p>There have been no reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span> in patients who have been treated with <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection.</p>
<p>One of 12 patients showed an enhanced rate of clearance of plasma ADA activity after 5 months of therapy at 15 U/kg/week. Enhanced clearance was correlated with the appearance of an antibody that directly inhibited both unmodified ADA and <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection. Subsequently, the patient was treated with twice weekly intramuscular injections at an increased dose of 20 U/kg, or a total weekly dose of 40 U/kg. No adverse effects were observed at the higher dose and effective levels of plasma ADA were restored. After 4 months, the patient returned to a weekly dosage schedule of 20 U/kg and effective plasma levels have been maintained.</p>
<p>Appropriate care to protect immune deficient patients should be maintained until improvement in immune function has been documented. The degree of immune function improvement may vary from patient to patient and, therefore, each patient will require appropriate care consistent with immunologic status.</p>

<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">The treatment of SCID associated with ADA deficiency with <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection should be monitored by measuring plasma ADA activity and red blood cell dATP levels.</p>
<p>Plasma ADA activity and red cell dATP should be determined prior to treatment. Once treatment with <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection has been initiated, a desirable range of plasma ADA activity (trough level before maintenance injection) should be 15â€“35 Î¼mol/hr/mL. This minimum trough level will ensure that plasma ADA activity from injection to injection is maintained above the level of total erythrocyte ADA activity in the blood of normal individuals.</p>
<p>Plasma ADA activity (pre-injection) should be determined every 1-2 weeks during the first 8-12 weeks of treatment in order to establish an effective dose of <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection. After 2 months of maintenance treatment with <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection, red cell dATP levels should decrease to a range of â‰¤ 0.005 to 0.015 Î¼mol/mL. The normal value of dATP is below 0.001 Î¼mol/mL. Once the level of dATP has fallen adequately, it should be measured 2-4 times a year during the remainder of the first year and 2-3 times a year thereafter, assuming no interruption in therapy.</p>
<p>Between 3 and 9 months, plasma ADA should be determined twice a month, then monthly until after 18-24 months of treatment with <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection.</p>
<p>Patients who have successfully been maintained on therapy for two years should continue to have plasma ADA measured every 2-4 months and red cell dATP measured twice yearly. More frequent monitoring would be necessary if therapy were interrupted or if an enhanced rate of clearance of plasma ADA activity develops.</p>
<p>Once effective ADA plasma levels have been established, should a patientâ€™s plasma ADA activity level <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> below 10 Î¼mol/hr/mL (which cannot be attributed to improper dosing, sample handling or antibody development) then the patients receiving this lot of <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection should be requested to have a blood sample for plasma ADA determination taken prior to their next injection of <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection.</p>
<p>Immune function, including the ability to produce antibodies, generally improves after 2-6 months of therapy, and matures over a longer period. Compared with the natural history of combined <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433740" conceptname="Immunodeficiency disorder">immunodeficiency</span> disease due to ADA deficiency, a trend toward diminished frequency of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4247535" conceptname="Opportunistic infectious disease">opportunistic infections</span> and fewer complications of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> has occurred in patients receiving <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection. However, the lag between the correction of the metabolic abnormalities and improved immune function with a trend toward diminished frequency of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> and complications of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> is variable, and has ranged from a few weeks to approximately 6 months. Improvement in the general clinical status of the patient may be gradual (as evidenced by improvement in various clinical parameters) but should be apparent by the end of the first year of therapy. Antibody to <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection may develop in patients and may result in more rapid clearance of <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection. Antibody to <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection should be suspected if a persistent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> in pre-injection levels of plasma ADA to &lt; 10 Î¼mol/hr/mL occurs. If other causes for a decline in plasma ADA levels can be ruled out [such as improper storage of <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection vials (freezing or prolonged storage at temperatures above 8Â°C), or improper handling of plasma samples (e.g., repeated freezing and thawing during transport to laboratory)], then a specific assay for antibody to ADA and <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection (ELISA, enzyme inhibition) should be performed.</p>
<p>In patients undergoing treatment with <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection, a decline in immune function, with increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4247535" conceptname="Opportunistic infectious disease">opportunistic infections</span> and complications of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, will result from failure to maintain adequate levels of plasma ADA activity [whether due to the development of antibody to <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection, to improper calculation of <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection dosage, to interruption of treatment or to improper storage of <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection with subsequent loss of activity]. If a persistent decline in plasma ADA activity occurs, immune function and clinical status should be monitored closely and precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>. If antibody to ADA or <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection is found to be the cause of a persistent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> in plasma ADA activity, then adjustment in the dosage of <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection and other measures may be taken to induce tolerance and restore adequate ADA activity.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">There is no documented experience with <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection overdosage. An intraperitoneal dose of 50,000 U/kg of <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection in mice resulted in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> up to 9%.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Before prescribing <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection the physician should be thoroughly familiar with the details of this prescribing information. For further information concerning the essential monitoring of <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection therapy, the prescribing physician should contact Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD 20878. Telephone 1-866-792-5172.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection is recommended for use in infants from birth or in children of any age at the time of diagnosis.</p>
<p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permits.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection should not be diluted nor mixed with any other drug prior to administration.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection should be administered every 7 days as an intramuscular injection. The dosage of <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection should be individualized. The recommended dosing schedule is 10 U/kg for the first dose, 15 U/kg for the second dose, and 20 U/kg for the third dose. The usual maintenance dose is 20 U/kg per week. Further increases of 5 U/kg/week may be necessary, but a maximum single dose of 30 U/kg should not be exceeded. Plasma levels of ADA more than twice the upper limit of 35 Î¼mol/hr/mL have occurred on occasion in several patients, and have been maintained for several weeks in one patient who received twice weekly injections (20 U/kg per dose) of <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection. No adverse effects have been observed at these higher levels; there is no evidence that maintaining pre-injection plasma ADA above 35 Î¼mol/hr/mL produces any additional clinical benefits.</p>
<p>Dose proportionality has not been established and patients should be closely monitored when the dosage is increased. <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection is not recommended for intravenous administration.</p>
<p>The optimal dosage and schedule of administration should be established for each patient based on monitoring of plasma ADA activity levels (trough levels before maintenance injection) and biochemical markers of ADA deficiency (primarily red cell dATP content). Since improvement in immune function follows correction of metabolic abnormalities, maintenance dosage in individual patients should be aimed at achieving the following biochemical goals: 1) maintain plasma ADA activity (trough levels before maintenance injection) in the range of 15-35 Î¼mol/hr/mL (assayed at 37Â°C); and 2) decline in erythrocyte dATP to â‰¤ 0.005-0.015 Î¼mol/mL packed erythrocytes, or â‰¤ 1% of the total erythrocyte adenine nucleotide (ATP + dATP) content, with a normal ATP level, as measured in a pre-injection sample. In addition, continued monitoring of immune function and clinical status is essential in any patient with a primary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433740" conceptname="Immunodeficiency disorder">immunodeficiency</span> disease and should be continued in patients undergoing treatment with <span class="Bold">ADAGEN<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pegademase bovine) Injection.</p>
