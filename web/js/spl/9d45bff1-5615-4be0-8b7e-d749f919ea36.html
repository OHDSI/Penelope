<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<a href="http://"></a><p class="First"></p>
<p>DIFLUCAN® (fluconazole), the first of a new subclass of synthetic triazole antifungal agents, is available as tablets for oral administration, as a powder for oral suspension, and as a sterile solution for intravenous use in glass and in Viaflex® Plus plastic containers.</p>
<p>Fluconazole is designated chemically as 2,4-difluoro-α,α<span class="Sup">1</span>-bis(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl) benzyl alcohol with an empirical formula of C<span class="Sub">13</span>H<span class="Sub">12</span>F<span class="Sub">2</span>N<span class="Sub">6</span>O and molecular weight of 306.3. The structural formula is:</p>

<p>Fluconazole is a white crystalline solid which is slightly soluble in water and saline.</p>
<p>DIFLUCAN Tablets contain 50, 100, 150, or 200 mg of fluconazole and the following inactive ingredients: microcrystalline cellulose, dibasic calcium phosphate anhydrous, povidone, croscarmellose sodium, FD&amp;C Red No. 40 aluminum lake dye, and magnesium stearate.</p>
<p>DIFLUCAN for Oral Suspension contains 350 mg or 1400 mg of fluconazole and the following inactive ingredients: sucrose, sodium citrate dihydrate, citric acid anhydrous, sodium benzoate, titanium dioxide, colloidal silicon dioxide, xanthan gum, and natural orange flavor. After reconstitution with 24 mL of distilled water or Purified Water (USP), each mL of reconstituted suspension contains 10 mg or 40 mg of fluconazole.</p>
<p>DIFLUCAN Injection is an iso-osmotic, sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of fluconazole in a sodium chloride or dextrose diluent. Each mL contains 2 mg of fluconazole and 9 mg of sodium chloride or 56 mg of dextrose, hydrous. The pH ranges from 4.0 to 8.0 in the sodium chloride diluent and from 3.5 to 6.5 in the dextrose diluent. Injection volumes of 100 mL and 200 mL are packaged in glass and in Viaflex® Plus plastic containers.</p>
<p>The Viaflex® Plus plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinyl chloride (PL 146® Plastic) (Viaflex and PL 146 are registered trademarks of Baxter International, Inc.). The amount of water that can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the plastic container can leach out certain of its chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period, e.g., di-2-ethylhexylphthalate (DEHP), up to 5 parts per million. However, the suitability of the plastic has been confirmed in tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers as well as by tissue culture toxicity studies.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<a href="http://"></a><p class="First"></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetic properties of fluconazole are similar following administration by the intravenous or oral routes. In normal volunteers, the bioavailability of orally administered fluconazole is over 90% compared with intravenous administration. Bioequivalence was established between the 100 mg tablet and both suspension strengths when administered as a single 200 mg dose.</p>
<p>Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) in fasted normal volunteers occur between 1 and 2 hours with a terminal plasma elimination half-life of approximately 30 hours (range: 20–50 hours) after oral administration.</p>
<p>In fasted normal volunteers, administration of a single oral 400 mg dose of DIFLUCAN (fluconazole) leads to a mean Cmax of 6.72 µg/mL (range: 4.12 to 8.08 µg/mL) and after single oral doses of 50–400 mg, fluconazole plasma concentrations and AUC (area under the plasma concentration-time curve) are dose proportional.</p>
<p>The C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC data from a food-effect study involving administration of DIFLUCAN (fluconazole) tablets to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and with a high-fat meal indicated that exposure to the drug is not affected by food.  Therefore, DIFLUCAN may be taken without regard to meals. (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Dosage">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>.)</p>
<p>Administration of a single oral 150 mg tablet of DIFLUCAN (fluconazole) to ten lactating women resulted in a mean Cmax of 2.61 µg/mL (range: 1.57 to 3.65 µg/mL).</p>
<p>Steady-state concentrations are reached within 5–10 days following oral doses of 50–400 mg given once daily. Administration of a loading dose (on day 1) of twice the usual daily dose results in plasma concentrations close to steady-state by the second day. The apparent volume of distribution of fluconazole approximates that of total body water. Plasma protein binding is low (11–12%). Following either single- or multiple oral doses for up to 14 days, fluconazole penetrates into all body fluids studied (see table below). In normal volunteers, saliva concentrations of fluconazole were equal to or slightly greater than plasma concentrations regardless of dose, route, or duration of dosing. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256449" conceptname="Bronchiectasis">bronchiectasis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4102774" conceptname="Productive cough">sputum</span> concentrations of fluconazole following a single 150 mg oral dose were equal to plasma concentrations at both 4 and 24 hours post dose. In patients with fungal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435785" conceptname="Meningitis">meningitis</span>, fluconazole concentrations in the CSF are approximately 80% of the corresponding plasma concentrations.</p>
<p>A single oral 150 mg dose of fluconazole administered to 27 patients penetrated into vaginal tissue, resulting in tissue:plasma ratios ranging from 0.94 to 1.14 over the first 48 hours following dosing.</p>
<p>A single oral 150 mg dose of fluconazole administered to 14 patients penetrated into vaginal fluid, resulting in fluid:plasma ratios ranging from 0.36 to 0.71 over the first 72 hours following dosing.</p>

<p>In normal volunteers, fluconazole is cleared primarily by renal excretion, with approximately 80% of the administered dose appearing in the urine as unchanged drug. About 11% of the dose is excreted in the urine as metabolites.</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of fluconazole are markedly affected by reduction in renal function. There is an inverse relationship between the elimination half-life and creatinine clearance. The dose of DIFLUCAN may need to be reduced in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#Dosage">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>.) A 3-hour hemodialysis session decreases plasma concentrations by approximately 50%.</p>
<p>In normal volunteers, DIFLUCAN administration (doses ranging from 200 mg to 400 mg once daily for up to 14 days) was associated with small and inconsistent effects on testosterone concentrations, endogenous corticosteroid concentrations, and the ACTH-stimulated cortisol response.</p>

<p>Clearance corrected for body weight was not affected by age in these studies. Mean body clearance in adults is reported to be 0.23 (17%) mL/min/kg.</p>
<p>In premature newborns (gestational age 26 to 29 weeks), the mean (%cv) clearance within 36 hours of birth was 0.180 (35%, N=7) mL/min/kg, which increased with time to a mean of 0.218 (31%, N=9) mL/min/kg six days later and 0.333 (56%, N=4) mL/min/kg 12 days later. Similarly, the half-life was 73.6 hours, which decreased with time to a mean of 53.2 hours six days later and 46.6 hours 12 days later.</p>

<p>A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 22 subjects, 65 years of age or older receiving a single 50 mg oral dose of fluconazole. Ten of these patients were concomitantly receiving diuretics. The Cmax was 1.54 mcg/mL and occurred at 1.3 hours post dose. The mean AUC was 76.4 ± 20.3 mcg∙h/mL, and the mean terminal half-life was 46.2 hours. These pharmacokinetic parameter values are higher than analogous values reported for normal young male volunteers. Coadministration of diuretics did not significantly alter AUC or Cmax. In addition, creatinine clearance (74 mL/min), the percent of drug recovered unchanged in urine (0–24 hr, 22%), and the fluconazole renal clearance estimates (0.124 mL/min/kg) for the elderly were generally lower than those of younger volunteers. Thus, the alteration of fluconazole disposition in the elderly appears to be related to reduced renal function characteristic of this group. A plot of each subject's terminal elimination half-life versus creatinine clearance compared with the predicted half-life – creatinine clearance curve derived from normal subjects and subjects with varying degrees of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> indicated that 21 of 22 subjects fell within the 95% confidence limit of the predicted half-life – creatinine clearance curves. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that higher values for the pharmacokinetic parameters observed in the elderly subjects compared with normal young male volunteers are due to the decreased kidney function that is expected in the elderly.</p>

<p>Oral contraceptives were administered as a single dose both before and after the oral administration of DIFLUCAN 50 mg once daily for 10 days in 10 healthy women. There was no significant difference in ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel AUC after the administration of 50 mg of DIFLUCAN. The mean increase in ethinyl estradiol AUC was 6% (range: –47 to 108%) and levonorgestrel AUC increased 17% (range: –33 to 141%).</p>
<p>In a second study, twenty-five normal females received daily doses of both 200 mg DIFLUCAN tablets or placebo for two, ten-day periods. The treatment cycles were one month apart with all subjects receiving DIFLUCAN during one cycle and placebo during the other. The order of study treatment was random. Single doses of an oral contraceptive tablet containing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol were administered on the final treatment day (day 10) of both cycles. Following administration of 200 mg of DIFLUCAN, the mean percentage increase of AUC for levonorgestrel compared to placebo was 25% (range: –12 to 82%) and the mean percentage increase for ethinyl estradiol compared to placebo was 38% (range: –11 to 101%). Both of these increases were statistically significantly different from placebo.</p>
<p>A third study evaluated the potential interaction of once weekly dosing of fluconazole 300 mg to 21 normal females taking an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone. In this placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, two-way crossover study carried out over three cycles of oral contraceptive treatment, fluconazole dosing resulted in small increases in the mean AUCs of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone compared to similar placebo dosing. The mean AUCs of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone increased by 24% (95% C.I. range: 18–31%) and 13% (95% C.I. range: 8–18%), respectively, relative to placebo. Fluconazole treatment did not cause a decrease in the ethinyl estradiol AUC of any individual subject in this study compared to placebo dosing. The individual AUC values of norethindrone decreased very slightly (&lt;5%) in 3 of the 21 subjects after fluconazole treatment.</p>

<p>DIFLUCAN 100 mg was administered as a single oral dose alone and two hours after a single dose of cimetidine 400 mg to six healthy male volunteers. After the administration of cimetidine, there was a significant decrease in fluconazole AUC and Cmax. There was a mean ± SD decrease in fluconazole AUC of 13% ± 11% (range: –3.4 to –31%) and Cmax decreased 19% ± 14% (range: –5 to –40%). However, the administration of cimetidine 600 mg to 900 mg intravenously over a four-hour period (from one hour before to 3 hours after a single oral dose of DIFLUCAN 200 mg) did not affect the bioavailability or pharmacokinetics of fluconazole in 24 healthy male volunteers.</p>

<p>Concomitant oral administration of 100 mg DIFLUCAN and 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide for 10 days in 13 normal volunteers resulted in a significant increase in fluconazole AUC and Cmax compared to DIFLUCAN given alone. There was a mean ± SD increase in fluconazole AUC and Cmax of 45% ± 31% (range: 19 to 114%) and 43% ± 31% (range: 19 to 122%), respectively. These changes are attributed to a mean ± SD reduction in renal clearance of 30% ± 12% (range: –10 to –50%).</p>

<p>Six healthy volunteers received terfenadine 60 mg BID for 15 days. Fluconazole 200 mg was administered daily from days 9 through 15. Fluconazole did not affect terfenadine plasma concentrations. Terfenadine acid metabolite AUC increased 36% ± 36% (range: 7 to 102%) from day 8 to day 15 with the concomitant administration of fluconazole. There was no change in cardiac repolarization as measured by Holter QTc intervals. Another study at a 400 mg and 800 mg daily dose of fluconazole demonstrated that DIFLUCAN taken in doses of 400 mg per day or greater significantly increases plasma levels of terfenadine when taken concomitantly.

<p> A placebo-controlled, randomized, multiple-dose study examined the potential interaction of fluconazole with cisapride. Two groups of 10 normal subjects were administered fluconazole 200 mg daily or placebo. Cisapride 20 mg four times daily was started after 7 days of fluconazole or placebo dosing. Following a single dose of fluconazole, there was a 101% increase in the cisapride AUC and a 91% increase in the cisapride Cmax. Following multiple doses of fluconazole, there was a 192% increase in the cisapride AUC and a 154% increase in the cisapride Cmax. Fluconazole significantly increased the QTc interval in subjects receiving cisapride 20 mg four times daily for 5 days. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#Contra">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#Precautions">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>.)</p>

<p>The effect of fluconazole on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of midazolam was examined in a randomized, cross-over study in 12 volunteers. In the study, subjects ingested placebo or 400 mg fluconazole on Day 1 followed by 200 mg daily from Day 2 to Day 6. In addition, a 7.5 mg dose of midazolam was orally ingested on the first day, 0.05 mg/kg was administered intravenously on the fourth day, and 7.5 mg orally on the sixth day. Fluconazole reduced the clearance of IV midazolam by 51%. On the first day of dosing, fluconazole increased the midazolam AUC and Cmax by 259% and 150%, respectively. On the sixth day of dosing, fluconazole increased the midazolam AUC and Cmax by 259% and 74%, respectively. The psychomotor effects of midazolam were significantly increased after oral administration of midazolam but not significantly affected following intravenous midazolam. </p>
<p>A second randomized, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, cross over study in three phases was performed to determine the effect of route of administration of fluconazole on the interaction between fluconazole and midazolam. In each phase the subjects were given oral fluconazole 400 mg and intravenous saline; oral placebo and intravenous fluconazole 400 mg; and oral placebo and IV saline. An oral dose of 7.5 mg of midazolam was ingested after fluconazole/placebo. The AUC and Cmax of midazolam were significantly higher after oral than IV administration of fluconazole. Oral fluconazole increased the midazolam AUC and Cmax by 272% and 129%, respectively. IV fluconazole increased the midazolam AUC and Cmax by 244% and 79%, respectively. Both oral and IV fluconazole increased the pharmacodynamic effects of midazolam. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#Precautions">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>.)</p>

<p>An open-label, randomized, three-way crossover study in 18 healthy subjects assessed the effect of a single 800 mg oral dose of fluconazole on the pharmacokinetics of a single 1200 mg oral dose of azithromycin as well as the effects of azithromycin on the pharmacokinetics of fluconazole. There was no significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interaction</span> between fluconazole and azithromycin.</p>

<p>Voriconazole is a substrate for both CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes.  Concurrent administration of oral Voriconazole (400 mg Q12h for 1 day, then 200 mg Q12h for 2.5 days) and oral fluconazole (400 mg on day 1, then 200 mg Q24h for 4 days) to 6 healthy male subjects resulted in an increase in Cmax and AUCτ of voriconazole by an average of 57% (90% CI: 20%, 107%) and 79% (90% CI: 40%, 128%), respectively. In a follow-on clinical study involving 8 healthy male subjects, reduced dosing and/or frequency of voriconazole and fluconazole did not eliminate or diminish this effect. Concomitant administration of voriconazole and fluconazole at any dose is not recommended. Close monitoring for adverse events related to voriconazole is recommended if voriconazole is used sequentially after fluconazole, especially within 24 h of the last dose of fluconazole.  (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#PRECAUTIONS">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>)</p>

<p>Fluconazole is a highly selective inhibitor of fungal cytochrome P450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14-α-demethylase. This enzyme functions to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. The subsequent loss of normal sterols correlates with the accumulation of 14-α-methyl sterols in fungi and may be responsible for the fungistatic activity of fluconazole. Mammalian cell demethylation is much less sensitive to fluconazole inhibition.</p>

<p>Fluconazole resistance may arise from a modification in the quality or quantity of the target enzyme (lanosterol 14-α-demethylase), reduced access to the drug target, or some combination of these mechanisms.</p>
<p>Point mutations in the gene (<span class="Italics">ERG11</span>) encoding for the target enzyme lead to an altered target with decreased affinity for azoles. Overexpression of <span class="Italics">ERG11 </span>results in the production of high concentrations of the target enzyme, creating the need for higher intracellular drug concentrations to inhibit all of the enzyme molecules in the cell.</p>
<p>The second major mechanism of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4150981" conceptname="Drug resistance">drug resistance</span> involves active efflux of fluconazole out of the cell through the activation of two types of multidrug efflux transporters; the major facilitators (encoded by <span class="Italics">MDR </span>genes) and those of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily (encoded by <span class="Italics">CDR </span>genes). Upregulation of the <span class="Italics">MDR </span>gene leads to fluconazole resistance, whereas, upregulation of <span class="Italics">CDR </span>genes may lead to resistance to multiple azoles.</p>
<p>Resistance in <span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433968" conceptname="Candidiasis">Candida</span> glabrata</span> usually includes upregulation of <span class="Italics">CDR</span> genes resulting in resistance to multiple azoles.

<p>
 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p></p>

<h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h1>
<a href="http://"></a><p class="First"></p>
<p>DIFLUCAN (fluconazole) is contraindicated in patients who have shown <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> to fluconazole or to any of its excipients. There is no information regarding cross-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> between fluconazole and other azole antifungal agents. Caution should be used in prescribing DIFLUCAN to patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> to other azoles. Coadministration of terfenadine is contraindicated in patients receiving DIFLUCAN (fluconazole) at multiple doses of 400 mg or higher based upon results of a multiple dose interaction study.  Coadministration of other drugs known to prolong the QT interval and which are metabolized via the enzyme CYP3A4 such as cisapride, astemizole, pimozide, and quinidine are contraindicated in patients receiving fluconazole.

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<a href="http://"></a><p class="First"></p>
<p><span class="Bold">(1) Hepatic injury: DIFLUCAN should be administered with caution to patients with liver dysfunction. DIFLUCAN has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatic toxicity, including fatalities primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions. In cases of DIFLUCAN-associated hepatotoxicity, no obvious relationship to total daily dose, duration of therapy, sex, or age of the patient has been observed. DIFLUCAN hepatotoxicity has usually, but not always, been reversible on discontinuation of therapy. Patients who develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438878" conceptname="Liver function tests abnormal">abnormal liver function tests</span> during DIFLUCAN therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. DIFLUCAN should be discontinued if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to DIFLUCAN.</span></p>
<p>(2) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">Anaphylaxis</span>: In rare cases, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylaxis</span> has been reported.</p>
<p>(3) Dermatologic: Patients have rarely developed exfoliative <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140842" conceptname="Changes in skin texture">skin disorders</span> during treatment with DIFLUCAN. In patients with serious underlying diseases (predominantly AIDS and malignancy), these have rarely resulted in a fatal outcome. Patients who develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rashes</span> during treatment with DIFLUCAN should be monitored closely and the drug discontinued if lesions progress.</p>
<p><a name="w_preg"></a>(4) Use in Pregnancy: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of DIFLUCAN in pregnant women. Available human data do not suggest an increased risk of congenital anomalies following a single maternal dose of 150 mg. A few published case reports describe a rare pattern of distinct congenital anomalies in infants exposed <span class="Italics">in utero</span> to high dose maternal fluconazole (400–800 mg/day) during most or all of the first trimester. These reported anomalies are similar to those seen in animal studies. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking the drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#pregnancy">PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy</a></span>.)</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<a href="http://"></a><p class="First"></p>
<p>Some azoles, including fluconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. During post-marketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of QT prolongation and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135823" conceptname="Torsades de pointes">torsade de pointes</span> in patients taking fluconazole. Most of these reports involved seriously ill patients with multiple confounding risk factors, such as structural heart disease, electrolyte abnormalities, and concomitant medications that may have been contributory.</p>
<p>Fluconazole should be administered with caution to patients with these potentially proarrhythmic conditions.</p>
<p>Concomitant use of fluconazole and erythromycin has the potential to increase the risk of cardiotoxicity (prolonged QT interval, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135823" conceptname="Torsades de pointes">torsade de pointes</span>) and consequently sudden heart <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. This combination should be avoided.</p>
<p>Fluconazole should be administered with caution to patients with renal dysfunction.</p>
<p>Fluconazole is a potent CYP2C9 inhibitor and a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor. Fluconazole treated patients who are concomitantly treated with drugs with a narrow therapeutic window metabolized through CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 should be monitored.</p>
<p>DIFLUCAN Powder for Oral Suspension contains sucrose and should not be used in patients with hereditary fructose, glucose/galactose <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194993" conceptname="Intestinal malabsorption">malabsorption</span>, and sucrase-isomaltase deficiency.</p>
<p>When driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into account that occasionally <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> may occur.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p></p>
<p>The convenience and efficacy of the single dose oral tablet of fluconazole regimen for the treatment of vaginal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432248" conceptname="Opportunistic mycosis">yeast infections</span> should be weighed against the acceptability of a higher incidence of drug related adverse events with DIFLUCAN (26%) versus intravaginal agents (16%) in U.S. comparative clinical studies. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#AR">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#CS">CLINICAL STUDIES</a></span>.)</p>

<p>(See <span class="Bold"><a href="#DI_Studies">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interaction Studies</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#Contra">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span>.) DIFLUCAN is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 2C9 and a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4. In addition to the observed /documented interactions mentioned below, there is a risk of increased plasma concentration of other compounds metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 coadministered with fluconazole. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these combinations and the patients should be carefully monitored. The enzyme inhibiting effect of fluconazole persists 4–5 days after discontinuation of fluconazole treatment due to the long half-life of fluconazole. Clinically or potentially significant drug interactions between DIFLUCAN and the following agents/classes have been observed. These are described in greater detail below:</p>
<p>Oral hypoglycemics<br>Coumarin-type anticoagulants<br>Phenytoin<br>Cyclosporine<br>Rifampin<br>Theophylline<br>Terfenadine<br>Cisapride<br>Astemizole<br>Rifabutin<br>Voriconazole<br>Tacrolimus<br>Short-acting benzodiazepines<br>Triazolam<br>Oral Contraceptives<br>Pimozide<br>Hydrochlorothiazide<br>Alfentanil<br>Amitriptyline, nortriptyline<br>Amphotericin B<br>Azithromycin<br>Carbamazepine<br>Calcium Channel Blockers<br>Celecoxib<br>Cyclophosphamide<br>Fentanyl<br>Halofantrine<br>HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors<br>Losartan<br>Methadone<br>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs<br>Prednisone<br>Saquinavir<br>Sirolimus<br>Vinca Alkaloids<br>Vitamin A<br>Zidovudine</p>

<p>Clinically significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> may be precipitated by the use of DIFLUCAN with oral hypoglycemic agents; one fatality has been reported from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> in association with combined DIFLUCAN and glyburide use. DIFLUCAN reduces the metabolism of tolbutamide, glyburide, and glipizide and increases the plasma concentration of these agents. When DIFLUCAN is used concomitantly with these or other sulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic agents, blood glucose concentrations should be carefully monitored and the dose of the sulfonylurea should be adjusted as necessary.

<p>Because of the occurrence of serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac dysrhythmias</span> secondary to prolongation of the QTc interval in patients receiving azole antifungals in conjunction with terfenadine, interaction studies have been performed. One study at a 200 mg daily dose of fluconazole failed to demonstrate a prolongation in QTc interval. Another study at a 400 mg and 800 mg daily dose of fluconazole demonstrated that DIFLUCAN taken in doses of 400 mg per day or greater significantly increases plasma levels of terfenadine when taken concomitantly. The combined use of fluconazole at doses of 400 mg or greater with terfenadine is contraindicated. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#Contra">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#DI_Studies">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interaction Studies</a></span>.) The coadministration of fluconazole at doses lower than 400 mg/day with terfenadine should be carefully monitored.</p>
<p>

<p>There have been reports of cardiac events, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135823" conceptname="Torsades de pointes">torsade de pointes</span>, in patients to whom fluconazole and cisapride were coadministered. A controlled study found that concomitant fluconazole 200 mg once daily and cisapride 20 mg four times a day yielded a significant increase in cisapride plasma levels and prolongation of QTc interval. The combined use of fluconazole with cisapride is contraindicated. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#Contra">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#DI_Studies">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interaction Studies</a></span>.)</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p></p>
<p>Concomitant administration of fluconazole with astemizole may decrease the clearance of astemizole.  Resulting increased plasma concentrations of astemizole can lead to QT prolongation and rare occurrences of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135823" conceptname="Torsades de pointes">torsade de pointes</span>. Coadministration of fluconazole and astemizole is contraindicated.  </p>

<p>There have been reports that an interaction exists when fluconazole is administered concomitantly with rifabutin, leading to increased serum levels of rifabutin up to 80%.  There have been reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4028363" conceptname="Uveitis">uveitis</span> in patients to whom fluconazole and rifabutin were coadministered. Patients receiving rifabutin and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored.

<p>Avoid concomitant administration of voriconazole and fluconazole.  Monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to voriconazole is recommended; especially, if voriconazole is started within 24 h after the last dose of fluconazole.  (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#DI_Studies">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interaction Studies</a>.</span>)</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p></p>
<p>Fluconazole may increase the serum concentrations of orally administered tacrolimus up to 5 times due to inhibition of tacrolimus metabolism through CYP3A4 in the intestines. No significant pharmacokinetic changes have been observed when tacrolimus is given intravenously. Increased tacrolimus levels have been associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126119" conceptname="Toxic nephropathy">nephrotoxicity</span>. Dosage of orally administered tacrolimus should be decreased depending on tacrolimus concentration. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#DI_Studies">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interaction Studies</a></span>.)</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p></p>
<p>Following oral administration of midazolam, fluconazole resulted in substantial increases in midazolam concentrations and psychomotor effects. This effect on midazolam appears to be more pronounced following oral administration of fluconazole than with fluconazole administered intravenously. If short-acting benzodiazepines, which are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, are concomitantly administered with fluconazole, consideration should be given to decreasing the benzodiazepine dosage, and the patients should be appropriately monitored. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#DI_Studies">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interaction Studies</a></span>.)</p>
<p>Fluconazole increases the AUC of triazolam (single dose) by approximately 50%, Cmax by 20–32%, and increases t½ by 25–50 % due to the inhibition of metabolism of triazolam. Dosage adjustments of triazolam may be necessary.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p></p>
<p>Two pharmacokinetic studies with a combined oral contraceptive have been performed using multiple doses of fluconazole. There were no relevant effects on hormone level in the 50 mg fluconazole study, while at 200 mg daily, the AUCs of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were increased 40% and 24%, respectively. Thus, multiple dose use of fluconazole at these doses is unlikely to have an effect on the efficacy of the combined oral contraceptive.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p></p>
<p>Although not studied <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> or <span class="Italics">in vivo</span>, concomitant administration of fluconazole with pimozide may result in inhibition of pimozide metabolism. Increased pimozide plasma concentrations can lead to QT prolongation and rare occurrences of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135823" conceptname="Torsades de pointes">torsade de pointes</span>. Coadministration of fluconazole and pimozide is contraindicated.</p>

<p>In a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interaction</span> study, coadministration of multiple dose hydrochlorothiazide to healthy volunteers receiving fluconazole increased plasma concentrations of fluconazole by 40%. An effect of this magnitude should not necessitate a change in the fluconazole dose regimen in subjects receiving concomitant diuretics.</p>

<a href="http://"></a><p></p>
<p>A study observed a reduction in clearance and distribution volume as well as prolongation of T<span class="Sub">½ </span>of alfentanil following concomitant treatment with fluconazole. A possible mechanism of action is fluconazole's inhibition of CYP3A4. Dosage adjustment of alfentanil may be necessary.</p>

<p>An open-label, randomized, three-way crossover study in 18 healthy subjects assessed the effect of a single 1200 mg oral dose of azithromycin on the pharmacokinetics of a single 800 mg oral dose of fluconazole as well as the effects of fluconazole on the pharmacokinetics of azithromycin. There was no significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interaction</span> between fluconazole and azithromycin.</p>

<p>The Cmax and AUC of flurbiprofen were increased by 23% and 81%, respectively, when coadministered with fluconazole compared to administration of flurbiprofen alone. Similarly, the Cmax and AUC of the pharmacologically active isomer [S-(+)-ibuprofen] were increased by 15% and 82%, respectively, when fluconazole was coadministered with racemic ibuprofen (400 mg) compared to administration of racemic ibuprofen alone.</p>
<p>Although not specifically studied, fluconazole has the potential to increase the systemic exposure of other NSAIDs that are metabolized by CYP2C9 (e.g., naproxen, lornoxicam, meloxicam, diclofenac).  Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to NSAIDs is recommended. Adjustment of dosage of NSAIDs may be needed.</p>

<p>Fluconazole increases the AUC of saquinavir by approximately 50%, Cmax by approximately 55%, and decreases clearance of saquinavir by approximately 50% due to inhibition of saquinavir's hepatic metabolism by CYP3A4 and inhibition of P-glycoprotein. Dosage adjustment of saquinavir may be necessary.</p>

<p>Fluconazole increases Cmax and AUC of zidovudine by 84% and 74%, respectively, due to an approximately 45% decrease in oral zidovudine clearance. The half-life of zidovudine was likewise prolonged by approximately 128% following combination therapy with fluconazole. Patients receiving this combination should be monitored for the development of zidovudine-related adverse reactions. Dosage reduction of zidovudine may be considered.</p>
<p>Physicians should be aware that interaction studies with medications other than those listed in the <span class="Bold"><a href="#CP">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span> section have not been conducted, but such interactions may occur.</p>

<p>Fluconazole showed no evidence of carcinogenic potential in mice and rats treated orally for 24 months at doses of 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 2–7× the recommended human dose). Male rats treated with 5 and 10 mg/kg/day had an increased incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4301500" conceptname="Liver cell adenoma">hepatocellular adenomas</span>.</p>
<p>Fluconazole, with or without metabolic activation, was negative in tests for mutagenicity in 4 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of <span class="Italics">S. typhimurium,</span> and in the mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> L5178Y system. Cytogenetic studies <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> (murine bone marrow cells, following oral administration of fluconazole) and <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> (human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span> exposed to fluconazole at 1000 µg/mL) showed no evidence of chromosomal mutations.</p>
<p>Fluconazole did not affect the fertility of male or female rats treated orally with daily doses of 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg or with parenteral doses of 5, 25, or 75 mg/kg, although the onset of parturition was slightly delayed at 20 mg/kg PO. In an intravenous perinatal study in rats at 5, 20, and 40 mg/kg, dystocia and prolongation of parturition were observed in a few dams at 20 mg/kg (approximately 5–15× the recommended human dose) and 40 mg/kg, but not at 5 mg/kg. The disturbances in parturition were reflected by a slight increase in the number of still born pups and decrease of neonatal survival at these dose levels. The effects on parturition in rats are consistent with the species specific estrogen-lowering property produced by high doses of fluconazole. Such a hormone change has not been observed in women treated with fluconazole. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#CP">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span>.)</p>

<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Diflucan in pregnant women. Available human data do not suggest an increased risk of congenital anomalies following a single maternal dose of 150 mg.</p>

<p>A few published case reports describe a rare pattern of distinct congenital anomalies in infants exposed <span class="Italics">in utero</span> to high dose maternal fluconazole (400–800 mg/day) during most or all of the first trimester. These reported anomalies are similar to those seen in animal studies. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking the drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus.

<p>Several published epidemiologic studies do not suggest an increased risk of congenital anomalies associated with low dose exposure to fluconazole in pregnancy (most subjects received a single oral dose of 150 mg). A few published case reports describe a distinctive and rare pattern of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span> among infants whose mothers received high-dose (400–800 mg/day) fluconazole during most or all of the first trimester of pregnancy.

<p>Fluconazole was administered orally to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis in two studies at doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg and at 5, 25, and 75 mg/kg, respectively. Maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span> was impaired at all dose levels (approximately 0.25 to 4 times the 400 mg clinical dose based on BSA), and abortions occurred at 75 mg/kg (approximately 4 times the 400 mg clinical dose based on BSA); no adverse fetal effects were observed.</p>
<p>In several studies in which pregnant rats received fluconazole orally during organogenesis, maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span> was impaired and placental weights were increased at 25 mg/kg. There were no fetal effects at 5 or 10 mg/kg; increases in fetal anatomical variants (supernumerary ribs, renal pelvis dilation) and delays in ossification were observed at 25 and 50 mg/kg and higher doses. At doses ranging from 80 to 320 mg/kg (approximately 2 to 8 times the 400 mg clinical dose based on BSA), embryolethality in rats was increased and fetal abnormalities included wavy ribs, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135923" conceptname="Cleft palate">cleft palate</span>, and abnormal cranio-facial ossification. These effects are consistent with the inhibition of estrogen synthesis in rats and may be a result of known effects of lowered estrogen on pregnancy, organogenesis, and parturition</p>

<p>The safety profile of DIFLUCAN in children has been studied in 577 children ages 1 day to 17 years who received doses ranging from 1 to 15 mg/kg/day for 1 to 1,616 days. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#AR">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span>.)</p>
<p>Efficacy of DIFLUCAN has not been established in infants less than 6 months of age. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#CP">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span>.) A small number of patients (29) ranging in age from 1 day to 6 months have been treated safely with DIFLUCAN.</p>

<p>In non-AIDS patients, side effects possibly related to fluconazole treatment were reported in fewer patients aged 65 and older (9%, n =339) than for younger patients (14%, n=2240). However, there was no consistent difference between the older and younger patients with respect to individual side effects. Of the most frequently reported (&gt;1%) side effects, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span> occurred in greater proportions of older patients. Similar proportions of older patients (2.4%) and younger patients (1.5%) discontinued fluconazole therapy because of side effects. In post-marketing experience, spontaneous reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span> were more frequent among patients 65 years of age or older than in those between 12 and 65 years of age. Because of the voluntary nature of the reports and the natural increase in the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> in the elderly, it is however not possible to establish a casual relationship to drug exposure.</p>
<p>Controlled clinical trials of fluconazole did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to evaluate whether they respond differently from younger patients in each indication. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.</p>
<p>Fluconazole is primarily cleared by renal excretion as unchanged drug. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken to adjust dose based on creatinine clearance. It may be useful to monitor renal function.

<p>In combined clinical trials and marketing experience, there have been rare cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with DIFLUCAN. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#Warnings">WARNINGS</a></span>.) The spectrum of these hepatic reactions has ranged from mild transient elevations in transaminases to clinical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4143915" conceptname="Cholestasis">cholestasis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4026032" conceptname="Acute hepatic failure">fulminant hepatic failure</span>, including fatalities. Instances of fatal hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly AIDS or malignancy) and often while taking multiple concomitant medications. Transient hepatic reactions, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span>, have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors.

<p>In two comparative trials evaluating the efficacy of DIFLUCAN for the suppression of relapse of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432310" conceptname="Cryptococcal meningitis">cryptococcal meningitis</span>, a statistically significant increase was observed in median AST (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4094657" conceptname="Aspartate aminotransferase">SGOT</span>) levels from a baseline value of 30 IU/L to 41 IU/L in one trial and 34 IU/L to 66 IU/L in the other. The overall rate of serum transaminase elevations of more than 8 times the upper limit of normal was approximately 1% in fluconazole-treated patients in clinical trials. These elevations occurred in patients with severe underlying disease, predominantly AIDS or malignancies, most of whom were receiving multiple concomitant medications, including many known to be hepatotoxic. The incidence of abnormally elevated serum transaminases was greater in patients taking DIFLUCAN concomitantly with one or more of the following medications: rifampin, phenytoin, isoniazid, valproic acid, or oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agents.</p>

<p>The recommended dosage of DIFLUCAN for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198363" conceptname="Candidiasis of vagina">vaginal candidiasis</span> is 150 mg as a single oral dose.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p></p>
<p>SINCE ORAL ABSORPTION IS RAPID AND ALMOST COMPLETE, THE DAILY DOSE OF DIFLUCAN (FLUCONAZOLE) IS THE SAME FOR ORAL (TABLETS AND SUSPENSION) AND INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION. In general, a loading dose of twice the daily dose is recommended on the first day of therapy to result in plasma concentrations close to steady-state by the second day of therapy.</p>

<p>Experience with DIFLUCAN in neonates is limited to pharmacokinetic studies in premature newborns. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#CP">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span>.) Based on the prolonged half-life seen in premature newborns (gestational age 26 to 29 weeks), these children, in the first two weeks of life, should receive the same dosage (mg/kg) as in older children, but administered every 72 hours. After the first two weeks, these children should be dosed once daily. No information regarding DIFLUCAN pharmacokinetics in full-term newborns is available.</p>

<p>DIFLUCAN may be administered either orally or by intravenous infusion. DIFLUCAN can be taken with or without food. DIFLUCAN injection has been used safely for up to fourteen days of intravenous therapy. The intravenous infusion of DIFLUCAN should be administered at a maximum rate of approximately 200 mg/hour, given as a continuous infusion.</p>
<p>DIFLUCAN injections in glass and Viaflex® Plus plastic containers are intended only for intravenous administration using sterile equipment.</p>
<p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.</p>
<p>Do not use if the solution is cloudy or precipitated or if the seal is not intact.</p>

<p>This leaflet contains important information about DIFLUCAN (dye-FLEW-kan). It is not meant to take the place of your doctor's instructions. Read this information carefully before you take DIFLUCAN.  Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand any of this information or if you want to know more about DIFLUCAN.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What Is DIFLUCAN?</span></p>
<p>DIFLUCAN is a tablet you swallow to treat vaginal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432248" conceptname="Opportunistic mycosis">yeast infections</span> caused by a yeast called <span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433968" conceptname="Candidiasis">Candida</span>. </span>DIFLUCAN helps stop too much yeast from growing in the vagina so the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432248" conceptname="Opportunistic mycosis">yeast infection</span> goes away.</p>
<p>DIFLUCAN is different from other treatments for vaginal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432248" conceptname="Opportunistic mycosis">yeast infections</span> because it is a tablet taken by mouth. DIFLUCAN is also used for other conditions.  However, this leaflet is only about using DIFLUCAN for vaginal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432248" conceptname="Opportunistic mycosis">yeast infections</span>.  For information about using DIFLUCAN for other reasons, ask your doctor or pharmacist.  See the section of this leaflet for information about vaginal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432248" conceptname="Opportunistic mycosis">yeast infections</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What Is a Vaginal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432248" conceptname="Opportunistic mycosis">Yeast Infection</span>?</span></p>
<p>It is normal for a certain amount of yeast to be found in the vagina. Sometimes too much yeast starts to grow in the vagina and this can cause a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432248" conceptname="Opportunistic mycosis">yeast infection</span>. Vaginal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432248" conceptname="Opportunistic mycosis">yeast infections</span> are common. About three out of every four adult women will have at least one vaginal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432248" conceptname="Opportunistic mycosis">yeast infection</span> during their life.</p>
<p>Some medicines and medical conditions can increase your chance of getting a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432248" conceptname="Opportunistic mycosis">yeast infection</span>. If you are pregnant, have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, use birth control pills, or take antibiotics you may get <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432248" conceptname="Opportunistic mycosis">yeast infections</span> more often than other women. Personal hygiene and certain types of clothing may increase your chances of getting a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432248" conceptname="Opportunistic mycosis">yeast infection</span>. Ask your doctor for tips on what you can do to help prevent vaginal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432248" conceptname="Opportunistic mycosis">yeast infections</span>.</p>
