<h1>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Sensipar tablets should be taken whole and should not be divided. Sensipar should be taken with food or shortly after a meal.</p>
<p>Dosage must be individualized.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The recommended starting oral dose of Sensipar is 30 mg once daily. Serum calcium and serum phosphorus should be measured within 1 week and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) should be measured 1 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose adjustment of Sensipar. Sensipar should be titrated no more frequently than every 2 to 4 weeks through sequential doses of 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 mg once daily to target iPTH levels of 150 to 300 pg/mL. Serum iPTH levels should be assessed no earlier than 12 hours after dosing with Sensipar.</p>
<p>Sensipar can be used alone or in combination with vitamin D sterols and/or phosphate binders.</p>
<p>During dose titration, serum calcium levels should be monitored frequently and if levels decrease below the normal range, appropriate steps should be taken to increase serum calcium levels, such as by providing supplemental calcium, initiating or increasing the dose of calcium-based phosphate binder, initiating or increasing the dose of vitamin D sterols, or temporarily withholding treatment with Sensipar <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<a href="#i4i_section_id_5f670e1d-f314-4dab-9b61-e9df62a28212">5.1</a>,<a href="#i4i_section_id_04d30445-31ab-4a05-b4e0-05898944aa9b">5.6</a>)]</span>.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The recommended starting oral dose of Sensipar is 30 mg twice daily. </span></p>
<p><span>The dose of Sensipar should be titrated every 2 to 4 weeks through sequential doses of 30 mg twice daily, 60 mg twice daily, and 90 mg twice daily, and 90 mg 3 or 4 times daily as necessary to normalize serum calcium levels <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<a href="#i4i_section_id_04d30445-31ab-4a05-b4e0-05898944aa9b">5.6</a>)].</span></span></p>

<p>Sensipar lowers serum calcium and, therefore, patients should be carefully monitored for the occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435510" conceptname="Hypocalcemia">hypocalcemia</span>. Potential manifestations of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435510" conceptname="Hypocalcemia">hypocalcemia</span> include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4193492" conceptname="Acroparesthesia">paresthesias</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442752" conceptname="Muscle pain">myalgias</span>, muscle cramping, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380534" conceptname="Tetany">tetany</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>.</p>
<p>Serum calcium should be measured within 1 week after initiation or dose adjustment of Sensipar. Once the maintenance dose has been established, serum calcium should be measured approximately monthly<span class="Italics"> [see Dosage and Administration (<a href="#i4i_section_id_cb7c332c-53ab-4a89-a05a-e22449f285b2">2.1</a>)]</span>.</p>
<p>If serum calcium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falls</span> below 8.4 mg/dL but remains above 7.5 mg/dL, or if symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435510" conceptname="Hypocalcemia">hypocalcemia</span> occur, calcium-containing phosphate binders and/or vitamin D sterols can be used to raise serum calcium. If serum calcium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falls</span> below 7.5 mg/dL, or if symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435510" conceptname="Hypocalcemia">hypocalcemia</span> persist and the dose of vitamin D cannot be increased, withhold administration of Sensipar until serum calcium levels reach 8.0 mg/dL and/or symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435510" conceptname="Hypocalcemia">hypocalcemia</span> have resolved. Treatment should be reinitiated using the next lowest dose of Sensipar<span class="Italics"> [see Dosage and Administration (<a href="#i4i_section_id_cb7c332c-53ab-4a89-a05a-e22449f285b2">2.1</a>)]</span>.</p>
<p>In 26-week studies of patients with CKD on dialysis, 66% of patients receiving Sensipar compared with 25% of patients receiving placebo developed at least one serum calcium value &lt; 8.4 mg/dL. Less than 1% of patients in each group permanently discontinued study drug due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435510" conceptname="Hypocalcemia">hypocalcemia</span>.</p>
<p>Sensipar is not indicated for patients with CKD not on dialysis. In patients with secondary HPT and CKD not on dialysis, the long term safety and efficacy of Sensipar have not been established.Â  Clinical studies indicate that Sensipar-treated patients with CKD not on dialysis have an increased risk for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435510" conceptname="Hypocalcemia">hypocalcemia</span> compared with Sensipar-treated patients with CKD on dialysis, which may be due to lower baseline calcium levels.Â  In a phase 3 study of 32 weeks duration and including 404 patients with CKD not on dialysis (302 cinacalcet, 102 placebo), in which the median dose for cinacalcet was 60 mg per day at the completion of the study, 80% of Sensipar-treated patients experienced at least one serum calcium value &lt; 8.4 mg/dL compared with 5% of patients receiving placebo.</p>

<p><span>In clinical studies, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> (primarily generalized or tonic-clonic) were observed in 1.4% (43/3049) of Sensipar-treated patients and 0.7% (5/687) of placebo-treated patients. While the basis for the reported difference in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> rate is not clear, the threshold for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> is lowered by significant reductions in serum calcium levels. Therefore, serum calcium levels should be closely monitored in patients receiving Sensipar, particularly in patients with a history of a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> disorder <span class="Italics">[see </span><span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (<a href="#i4i_section_id_5f670e1d-f314-4dab-9b61-e9df62a28212">5.1</a>)]</span>Â .</span></p>

<p> Serum calcium and serum phosphorus should be measured within 1 week and iPTH should be measured 1 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose adjustment of Sensipar. Once the maintenance dose has been established, serum calcium and serum phosphorus should be measured approximately monthly, and iPTH every 1 to 3 months <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (<a href="#i4i_section_id_cb7c332c-53ab-4a89-a05a-e22449f285b2">2.1</a>)]</span>.

<p>In patients with end-stage <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>, testosterone levels are often below the normal range. In a placebo-controlled study in patients with CKD on dialysis, there were reductions in total and free testosterone in male patients following 6 months of treatment with Sensipar. Levels of total testosterone decreased by a median of 15.8% in the Sensipar-treated patients and by 0.6% in the placebo-treated patients. Levels of free testosterone decreased by a median of 31.3% in the Sensipar-treated patients and by 16.3% in the placebo-treated patients. The clinical significance of these reductions in serum testosterone is unknown.</p>

<p>The incidence of serious adverse reactions was similar in the Sensipar and placebo groups (29% vs. 31%, respectively).</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Two hundred sixty-six patients from two of the phase 3 studies in patients with CKD on dialysis continued to receive Sensipar or placebo treatment in a 6-month, double-blind extension study (12-month total treatment duration). The incidence and nature of adverse reactions in this long term extension study were comparable to those observed in the original phase 3 studies.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The safety profile of Sensipar in these patient populations is generally consistent with that seen in patients with CKD on dialysis. Forty six patients were treated with cinacalcet in a single arm study, 29 with Parathyroid Carcinoma and 17 with intractable pHPT. Nine (20%) of the patients withdrew from the study due to adverse events. The most frequent adverse reactions and the most frequent cause of withdrawal in these patient populations were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>.

<p>Studies in rats have shown that Sensipar is excreted in the milk with a high milk-to-plasma ratio. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Considering these data in rats, and because many drugs are excreted in human milk and there is a potential for clinically significant adverse reactions in infants who ingest Sensipar, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the lactating woman.</p>

<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Sensipar (cinacalcet) is a calcimimetic agent that increases the sensitivity of the calcium-sensing receptor to activation by extracellular calcium. Sensipar tablets contain the hydrochloride salt of cinacalcet. Its empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">22</span>H<span class="Sub">22</span>F<span class="Sub">3</span>NÂ·HCl with a molecular weight of 393.9 g/mol (hydrochloride salt) and 357.4 g/mol (free base). It has one chiral center having an R-absolute configuration. The R-enantiomer is the more potent enantiomer and has been shown to be responsible for pharmacodynamic activity.</p>
<p>The hydrochloride salt of cinacalcet is a white to off-white, crystalline solid that is soluble in methanol or 95% ethanol and slightly soluble in water.</p>
<p>Sensipar tablets are formulated as light-green, film-coated, oval-shaped tablets for oral administration in strengths of 30 mg, 60 mg, and 90 mg of cinacalcet as the free base equivalent (33 mg, 66 mg, and 99 mg as the hydrochloride salt, respectively).</p>
<p>The hydrochloride salt of cinacalcet is described chemically as N-[1-(R)-(-)-(1-naphthyl)ethyl]-3-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1-aminopropane hydrochloride and has the following structural formula:</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Secondary HPT in patients with CKD is a progressive disease, associated with increases in PTH levels and derangements in calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Increased PTH stimulates osteoclastic activity resulting in cortical bone resorption and marrow <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012171" conceptname="Fibrosis">fibrosis</span>. The goals of treatment of secondary HPT are to lower the levels of PTH, calcium, and phosphorus in the blood in order to prevent progressive bone disease and the systemic consequences of disordered mineral metabolism. Reductions in PTH are associated with a decrease in bone turnover and bone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012171" conceptname="Fibrosis">fibrosis</span> in patients with CKD on dialysis and uncontrolled secondary HPT. </p>
<p>The calcium-sensing receptor on the surface of the chief cell of the parathyroid gland is the principal regulator of PTH synthesis and secretion. Sensipar directly lowers PTH levels by increasing the sensitivity of the calcium-sensing receptor to extracellular calcium. The reduction in PTH is associated with a concomitant decrease in serum calcium levels. Measurements of PTH during the Sensipar studies were obtained using the Nichols IRMA.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Reduction in iPTH levels correlated with the plasma cinacalcet concentrations in patients with CKD. The nadir in iPTH level occurs approximately 2 to 6Â hours post dose, corresponding with the maximum plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of cinacalcet. After steady-state cinacalcet concentrations are reached (which occurs within 7 days of dose change), serum calcium concentrations remain constant over the dosing interval in patients with CKD.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>After oral administration of cinacalcet, C<span class="Sub">max</span> is achieved in approximately 2 to 6 hours. Cinacalcet C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">(0-inf)</span> were increased by 82% and 68%, respectively, following administration with a high-fat meal compared with fasting in healthy volunteers. The C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">(0-inf)</span> of cinacalcet were increased by 65% and 50%, respectively, when cinacalcet was administered with a low-fat meal compared with fasting. </p>
<p>After absorption, cinacalcet concentrations decline in a biphasic fashion with a terminal half-life of 30 to 40 hours. Steady-state drug levels are achieved within 7 days, and the mean accumulation ratio is approximately 2 with once daily oral administration. The median accumulation ratio is approximately 2 to 5 with twice daily oral administration. The AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of cinacalcet increase proportionally over the dose range of 30 to 180 mg once daily. The pharmacokinetic profile of cinacalcet does not change over time with once daily dosing of 30 to 180 mg. The volume of distribution is approximately 1000 L, indicating extensive distribution. Cinacalcet is approximately 93% to 97% bound to plasma protein(s). The ratio of blood cinacalcet concentration to plasma cinacalcet concentration is 0.80 at a blood cinacalcet concentration of 10 ng/mL. </p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cinacalcet is metabolized by multiple enzymes, primarily CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2. After administration of a 75 mg radiolabeled dose to healthy volunteers, cinacalcet was metabolized via: 1) oxidative N-dealkylation to hydrocinnamic acid and hydroxy-hydrocinnamic acid, which are further metabolized via Î²-oxidation and glycine conjugation; the oxidative N-dealkylation process also generates metabolites that contain the naphthalene ring; and 2) oxidation of the naphthalene ring on the parent drug forming dihydrodiols, which are further conjugated with glucuronic acid. The plasma concentrations of the major circulating metabolites, including the cinnamic acid derivatives and glucuronidated dihydrodiols, markedly exceed the parent drug concentrations. The hydrocinnamic acid metabolite and glucuronide conjugates have minimal or no calcimimetic activity. Renal excretion of metabolites was the primary route of elimination of radioactivity. Approximately 80% of the dose was recovered in the urine and 15% in the feces.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>In vitro studies indicate that cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6, but not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. In vitro induction studies indicate that cinacalcet is not an inducer of CYP450 enzymes. <a href="#id_22ec5007-cccd-4657-a076-4ce3e6d1dd4a">Tables 3</a> and <a href="#id_2db3cd6e-930c-47c1-8e09-02f62ac2f65c">4</a> list the findings from in vivo drug-drug interaction studies.<br></p>

<h1>NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Standard lifetime dietary carcinogenicity bioassays were conducted in mice and rats. Mice were given cinacalcet at dietary doses of 15, 50, and 125 mg/kg/day in males and 30, 70, and 200 mg/kg/day in females (exposures up to 2 times those resulting with a human oral dose of 180 mg/day based on AUC comparison). Rats were given dietary doses of 5, 15, and 35 mg/kg/day in males and 5, 20, and 35 mg/kg/day in females (exposures up to 2 times those resulting with a human oral dose of 180 mg/day based on AUC comparison). NoÂ increased incidence of tumors was observed following treatment with cinacalcet.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cinacalcet was not genotoxic in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, nor in the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell HGPRT forward mutation assay and CHO cell chromosomal aberration assay, with and without metabolic activation, nor in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Female rats were given oral gavage doses of 5, 25, and 75 mg/kg/day cinacalcet beginning 2 weeks before mating and continuing through gestation day 7. Male rats were given oral doses 4 weeks prior to mating, during mating (3 weeks) and 2 weeks postmating. No effects were observed in male or female fertility at 5 and 25 mg/kg/day (exposures up to 3 times those resulting with a human oral dose of 180 mg/day based on AUC comparison). At 75 mg/kg/day, there were slight adverse effects (slight decreases in body weight and food consumption) in males and females.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Three 6-month, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies of similar design were conducted in patients with CKD on dialysis. A total of 665 patients were randomized to Sensipar and 471 patients to placebo. The mean age of the patients was 54 years, 62% were male, and 52% were Caucasian. The average baseline iPTH level by the Nichols IRMA was 712Â pg/mL, with 26% of the patients having a baseline iPTH level &gt; 800 pg/mL. The mean baseline Ca x P ion product was 61 mg<span class="Sup">2</span>/dL<span class="Sup">2</span>. The average duration of dialysis prior to study enrollment was 67 months. Ninety-six percent of patients were on hemodialysis and 4% on peritoneal dialysis. At study entry, 66% of the patients were receiving vitamin D sterols and 93% were receiving phosphate binders. Sensipar (or placebo) was initiated at a dose of 30 mg once daily and titrated every 3 or 4 weeks to a maximum dose of 180 mg once daily to achieve an iPTH of â‰¤ 250 pg/mL. The dose was not increased if a patient had any of the following: iPTH â‰¤Â 200 pg/mL, serum calcium &lt; 7.8 mg/dL, or any symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435510" conceptname="Hypocalcemia">hypocalcemia</span>. If a patient experienced symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435510" conceptname="Hypocalcemia">hypocalcemia</span> or had a serum calcium &lt; 8.4 mg/dL, calcium supplements and/or calcium-based phosphate binders could be increased. If these measures were insufficient, the vitamin D dose could be increased. Approximately 70% of patients in the Sensipar arm and 80% of the patients in the placebo arm completed the 6-month studies. In the primary efficacy analysis, 40% of the patients on Sensipar and 5% of placebo-treated patients achieved an iPTH â‰¤ 250 pg/mL (p &lt; 0.001) (<a href="#id_d41d0a43-49a7-43d1-ac6b-bc1a54bea726">Table 5</a>, <a href="#id_50d85498-76a9-482a-a5a9-cd14ef0556be">Figure 1</a>). These studies showed that Sensipar reduced iPTH while lowering Ca x P, calcium, and phosphorus levels (<a href="#id_d41d0a43-49a7-43d1-ac6b-bc1a54bea726">Table 5</a>, <a href="#id_32116505-a69d-437b-8525-f1cc0b7b0d90">Figure 2</a>). The median dose of Sensipar at the completion of the studies was 90 mg. Patients with milder disease typically required lower doses.</p>
<p>Similar results were observed when either the iPTH or biointact PTH (biPTH) assay was used to measure PTH levels in CKD patients on dialysis; treatment with cinacalcet did not alter the relationship between iPTH and biPTH.</p>

<p>Reductions in iPTH and Ca x P were maintained for up to 12 months of treatment.<br><br>Sensipar decreased iPTH and Ca x P levels regardless of disease severity (i.e., baseline iPTH value), duration of dialysis, and whether or not vitamin D sterols were administered. Approximately 60% of patients with mild (iPTH â‰¥ 300 to â‰¤ 500 pg/mL), 41% with moderate (iPTH &gt; 500 to 800 pg/mL), and 11% with severe (iPTH &gt; 800 pg/mL) secondary HPT achieved a mean iPTH value of â‰¤ 250 pg/mL.

<p>Twenty-nine patients with Parathyroid Carcinoma were enrolled in a single-arm, open-label study. The study consisted of two phases, a dose-titration phase and a maintenance phase. Patients initially received 30 mg cinacalcet twice daily and then were titrated every 2 weeks to a maximum dose of 90 mg four times daily. Dosage escalation during the variable-length (2 to 16 weeks) titration phase continued until the serum calcium concentration was â‰¤ 10 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L), the patient reached the highest possible dosage, or adverse events precluded further dosage increases.</p>
<p>Twenty-nine patients entered the study. The median exposure to cinacalcet was 229 days (range: 1 to 1051). At baseline the mean (SE) serum calcium was 14.1 (0.4) mg/dL. At the end of the titration phase, the mean (SE) serum calcium was 12.4 (0.5) mg/dL, which is a mean reduction of 1.7 (0.6) mg/dL from baseline. Figure 3 illustrates mean serum calcium (mg/dL) over time for all patients still on study at each time point from the beginning of titration to study visit week 80. Daily dose during the study ranged from 30 mg twice daily to 90 mg four times daily.</p>
