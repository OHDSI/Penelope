<p class="First"><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION</span><br>InfasurfÂ® (calfactant) Intratracheal Suspension is a sterile, non-pyrogenic lung surfactant intended for intratracheal instillation only. It is an extract of natural surfactant from calf lungs which includes phospholipids, neutral lipids, and hydrophobic surfactant-associated proteins B and C (SP-B and SP-C). It contains no preservatives. <br></p>
<p>Infasurf is an off-white suspension of calfactant in 0.9% aqueous sodium chloride solution. It has a pH of 5.0 - 6.2 (target pH 5.7). Each milliliter of Infasurf contains 35 mg total phospholipids (including 26 mg phosphatidylcholine of which 16 mg is disaturated phosphatidylcholine) and 0.7 mg proteins including 0.26 mg of SP-B.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span><br>Endogenous lung surfactant is essential for effective ventilation because it modifies alveolar surface <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4200706" conceptname="Tension">tension</span> thereby stabilizing the alveoli. Lung surfactant deficiency is the cause of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4158346" conceptname="Respiratory distress">Respiratory Distress</span> Syndrome (RDS) in premature infants. Infasurf restores surface activity to the lungs of these infants.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Activity:</span> Infasurf adsorbs rapidly to the surface of the air:liquid interface and modifies surface <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4200706" conceptname="Tension">tension</span> similarly to natural lung surfactant. A minimum surface <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4200706" conceptname="Tension">tension</span> of less than or equal to 3 mN/m is produced<span class="Italics"> in vitro</span> by Infasurf as measured on a pulsating bubble surfactometer. <span class="Italics">Ex vivo</span>, Infasurf restores the pressure volume mechanics and compliance of surfactant-deficient rat lungs. <span class="Italics">In vivo</span>, Infasurf improves lung compliance, respiratory gas exchange, and survival in preterm lambs with profound surfactant deficiency.<br></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Animal Metabolism:</span> Infasurf is administered directly to the lung lumen surface, its site of action. No human studies of absorption, biotransformation, or excretion of Infasurf have been performed. The administration of Infasurf with radiolabeled phospholipids into the lungs of adult rabbits results in the persistence of 50% of radioactivity in the lung alveolar lining and25% of radioactivity in the lung tissue 24 hours later. Less than 5% of the radioactivity is found in other organs. In premature lambs with lethal surfactant deficiency, less than 30% of instilled Infasurf is present in the lung lining after 24 hours.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Studies</span>: The efficacy of Infasurf was demonstrated in two multiple-dose controlled clinical trials involving approximately 2,000 infants treated with Infasurf (approximately 100 mg phospholipid/kg) or Exosurf NeonatalÂ®. In addition, two controlled trials of Infasurf versus SurvantaÂ®, and four uncontrolled trials were conducted that involved approximately 15,500 patients treated with Infasurf. <br></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Infasurf versus Exosurf NeonatalÂ®</span></p>
<p>Treatment Trial<br>A total of 1,126 infants less than or equal to 72 hours of age with RDS who required endotracheal intubation and had an a/A PO2 less thanÂ  0.22 were enrolled into a multiple-dose, randomized, double-blind treatment trial comparing Infasurf (3 mL/kg) and Exosurf NeonatalÂ® (5 mL/kg). Patients were given an initial dose and one repeat dose 12 hours later if intubation was still required. The dose was instilled in two aliquots through a side port adapter into the proximal end of the endotracheal tube. Each aliquot was given in small bursts over 20-30 inspiratory cycles. After each aliquot was instilled, the infant was positioned with either the right or the left side dependent. Results for efficacy parameters evaluated at 28 days or to discharge for all treated patients from this treatment trial are shown in Table 1.</p>

Repeat doses were allowed Greater than or equal to 6 hours following the previous treatment (for up to three doses before 96 hours of age) if the patient required Greater than or equal to 30% oxygen. The surfactant was given through a 5 French feeding catheter inserted into the endo tracheal tube. The total dose was instilled in four equal aliquots with the catheter removed between each of the instillations and mechanical ventilation resumed for 0.5 to 2 minutes.

<p>The dose (3 mL/kg) was administered in two aliquots of 1.5 mL/kg each. After each aliquot was instilled, the infant was positioned with either the right or the left side dependent. Administration was made while ventilation was continued over 20-30 breaths for each aliquot, with small bursts timed only during the inspiratory cycles. A pause followed by evaluation of the respiratory status and repositioning separated the two aliquots. Repeat doses of 3 mL/kg of birth weight, up to a total of 3 doses 12 hours apart, were given if the patient was still intubated.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Survanta Active Control Trials: Initial and Repeat Dosing</span><br>In the Infasurf vs. SurvantaÂ® trials, Infasurf was administered through a 5 French feeding catheter inserted into the endotracheal tube. The total dose was instilled in four equal aliquots with the catheter removed between each of the instillations and mechanical ventilation resumed for 0.5 to 2 minutes. Each of the aliquots was administered with the patient in one of four different positions (prone, supine, right, and left lateral) to facilitate even distribution of the surfactant. Repeat doses were administered as early as 6 hours after the previous dose for a total of up to 4 doses if the infant was still intubated and required at least 30% inspired oxygen to maintain a PaO2 less than or equal toÂ  80 torr.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Administration for Prophylaxis of RDS at Birth</span><br>Dosing procedures are described under Administration for Treatment of RDS. The amount of a prophylaxis dose of Infasurf should be based on the infantâ€™s birth weight. Administration of Infasurf for prophylaxis should be given as soon as possible after birth. Usually the immediate care and stabilization of the premature infant born with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437390" conceptname="Hypoxemia">hypoxemia</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span> should precede Infasurf prophylaxis.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Dosing Precautions</span><br>During administration of Infasurf liquid suspension into the airway, infants often experience <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>, reflux of Infasurf into the endotracheal tube, airway obstruction, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438555" conceptname="Cyanosis">cyanosis</span>, dislodgement of the endotracheal tube, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312603" conceptname="Hypoventilation">hypoventilation</span>. If any of these events occur, the administration should be interrupted and the infantâ€™s condition should be stabilized using appropriate interventions before the administration of Infasurf is resumed. Endotracheal suctioning or reintubation is sometimes needed when there are signs of airway obstruction during the administration of the surfactant.<br></p>
