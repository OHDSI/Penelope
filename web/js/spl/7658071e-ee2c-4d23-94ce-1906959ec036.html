<h1><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION
</span></h1>
<p class="First">Dextroamphetamine sulfate is the dextro isomer of the compound d,l-amphetamine sulfate, a sympathomimetic amine of the amphetamine group. Chemically, dextroamphetamine is d-alpha-methylphenethylamine, and is present in all forms of dextroamphetamine sulfate as the neutral sulfate.</p>
<p>Structural Formula:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="Structural Formula" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=7658071e-ee2c-4d23-94ce-1906959ec036&amp;name=dextroamphetamine-sulfate-oral-solution-1.jpg"></div>
<p>Dextroamphetamine sulfate is a colorless, bubble gum flavored oral solution. Each 5 mL (1 teaspoonful) of dextroamphetamine sulfate oral solution contains 5 mg of dextroamphetamine sulfate. Inactive ingredients consist of anhydrous citric acid, benzoic acid, bubble gum flavor, purified water, sodium citrate anhydrous, sodium saccharin, and sorbitol solution.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</span></h1>
<p class="First">Amphetamines are noncatecholamine, sympathomimetic amines with CNS stimulant activity. Peripheral actions include elevations of systolic and diastolic blood pressures and weak bronchodilator and respiratory stimulant action.</p>
<p>There is neither specific evidence that clearly establishes the mechanism whereby amphetamines produce mental and behavioral effects in children, nor conclusive evidence regarding how these effects relate to the condition of the central nervous system.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics
</span></h2>
<p class="First">Ingestion of 10 mg of dextroamphetamine sulfate in oral solution form by healthy volunteers produced an average peak dextroamphetamine blood level of 33.2 ng/mL. The half-life was 11.75 hours. The average urinary recovery was 38% in 48 hours.</p>
<p>In 12 healthy subjects, the rate and extent of dextroamphetamine absorption were similar following administration of the sustained release capsule formulation in the fed (58 to 75 gm fat) and fasted state.</p>

Published data are inadequate to determine whether chronic use of amphetamines may cause a similar suppression of growth, however, it is anticipated that they likely have this effect as well.

<p>Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with dextroamphetamine and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide is available for dextroamphetamine sulfate oral solution. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have.

<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Acidifying agents </span></span>– Gastrointestinal acidifying agents (guanethidine, reserpine, glutamic acid HCl, ascorbic acid, fruit juices, etc.) lower absorption of amphetamines. Urinary acidifying agents (ammonium chloride, sodium acid phosphate, etc.) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the amphetamine molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion.

Urinary alkalinizing agents (acetazolamide, some thiazides) increase the concentration of the non-ionized species of the amphetamine molecule, thereby decreasing urinary excretion.

<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Antidepressants, tricyclic</span></span> – Amphetamines may enhance the activity of tricyclic or sympathomimetic agents; d-amphetamine with desipramine or protriptyline and possibly other tricyclics cause striking and sustained increases in the concentration of d-amphetamine in the brain; cardiovascular effects can be potentiated.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">MAO inhibitors</span></span> – MAOI antidepressants, as well as a metabolite of furazolidone, slow amphetamine metabolism.

<p>Clinical experience suggests that in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychotic</span> children, administration of amphetamines may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder.</p>
<p>Amphetamines have been reported to exacerbate motor and phonic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4297396" conceptname="Tic">tics</span> and Tourette’s syndrome. Therefore, clinical evaluation for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4297396" conceptname="Tic">tics</span> and Tourette’s syndrome in children and their families should precede use of stimulant medications.</p>
<p>Data are inadequate to determine whether chronic administration of amphetamines may be associated with growth inhibition; therefore, growth should be monitored during treatment.</p>

The decision to prescribe amphetamines should depend on the physician’s assessment of the chronicity and severity of the child’s symptoms and their appropriateness for his or her age. Prescription should not depend solely on the presence of one or more of the behavioral characteristics.</p>
<p>When these symptoms are associated with acute stress reactions, treatment with amphetamines is usually not indicated.</p>
