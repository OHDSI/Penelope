<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">The precise mechanism(s) by which zonisamide exerts its antiseizure effect is unknown. Zonisamide demonstrated anticonvulsant activity in several experimental models. In animals, zonisamide was effective against tonic extension <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> induced by maximal electroshock but ineffective against <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4265182" conceptname="Clonic seizure">clonic seizures</span> induced by subcutaneous pentylenetetrazol. Zonisamide raised the threshold for generalized <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> in the kindled rat model and reduced the duration of cortical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106574" conceptname="Partial seizure">focal seizures</span> induced by electrical stimulation of the visual cortex in cats. Furthermore, zonisamide suppressed both interictal spikes and the secondarily generalized <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> produced by cortical application of tungstic acid gel in rats or by cortical freezing in cats. The relevance of these models to human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> is unknown.</p>
<p>Zonisamide may produce these effects through action at sodium and calcium channels. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> pharmacological studies suggest that zonisamide blocks sodium channels and reduces voltage-dependent, transient inward currents (T-type Ca<span class="Sup">2+</span> currents), consequently stabilizing neuronal membranes and suppressing neuronal hypersynchronization. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> binding studies have demonstrated that zonisamide binds to the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor ionophore complex in an allosteric fashion which does not produce changes in chloride flux. Other <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies have demonstrated that zonisamide (10 to 30 mcg/mL) suppresses synaptically-driven electrical activity without affecting postsynaptic GABA or glutamate responses (cultured mouse spinal cord neurons) or neuronal or glial uptake of [<span class="Sup">3</span>H]-GABA (rat hippocampal slices). Thus, zonisamide does not appear to potentiate the synaptic activity of GABA. <span class="Italics">In vivo</span> microdialysis studies demonstrated that zonisamide facilitates both dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission. </p>
<p>Zonisamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. The contribution of this pharmacological action to the therapeutic effects of zonisamide is unknown. However, as a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, zonisamide may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span> (see <a href="#i4i_warnings_id_warnings">WARNINGS</a>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">Metabolic Acidosis</span> subsection).</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Following a 200 mg to 400 mg oral zonisamide dose, peak plasma concentrations (range: 2 to 5 mcg/mL) in normal volunteers occur within 2 to 6 hours. In the presence of food, the time to maximum concentration is delayed, occurring at 4 to 6 hours, but food has no effect on the bioavailability of zonisamide. Zonisamide extensively binds to erythrocytes, resulting in an 8-fold higher concentration of zonisamide in red blood cells (RBC) than in plasma. The pharmacokinetics of zonisamide are dose proportional in the range of 200 mg to 400 mg, but the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC increase disproportionately at 800 mg, perhaps due to saturable binding of zonisamide to RBC. Once a stable dose is reached, steady state is achieved within 14 days. The elimination half-life of zonisamide in plasma is about 63 hours. The elimination half-life of zonisamide in RBC is approximately 105 hours.</p>
<p>The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of zonisamide is about 1.45 L/kg following a 400 mg oral dose. Zonisamide, at concentrations of 1 to 7 mcg/mL, is approximately 40% bound to human plasma proteins. Protein binding of zonisamide is unaffected in the presence of therapeutic concentrations of phenytoin, phenobarbital or carbamazepine.</p>

<h2>Metabolism and Excretion</h2>
<p class="First">Following oral administration of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-zonisamide to healthy volunteers, only zonisamide was detected in plasma. Zonisamide is excreted primarily in urine as parent drug and as the glucuronide of a metabolite. Following multiple dosing, 62% of the <span class="Sup">14</span>C dose was recovered in the urine, with 3% in the feces by day 10. Zonisamide undergoes acetylation to form N-acetyl zonisamide and reduction to form the open ring metabolite, 2–sulfamoylacetyl phenol (SMAP). Of the excreted dose, 35% was recovered as zonisamide, 15% as N-acetyl zonisamide, and 50% as the glucuronide of SMAP. Reduction of zonisamide to SMAP is mediated by cytochrome P450 isozyme 3A4 (CYP3A4). Zonisamide does not induce its own metabolism. Plasma clearance of zonisamide is approximately 0.30 to 0.35 mL/min/kg in patients not receiving enzyme-inducing antiepilepsy drugs (AEDs). The clearance of zonisamide is increased to 0.5 mL/min/kg in patients concurrently on enzyme-inducing AEDs.</p>
<p>Renal clearance is about 3.5 mL/min. The clearance of an oral dose of zonisamide from RBC is 2 mL/min.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold">Interactions of Zonisamide with Other Antiepilepsy Drugs (AEDs):</span></h3>
<p class="First">Concurrent medication with drugs that either induce or inhibit CYP3A4 may alter serum concentrations of zonisamide. Concomitant administration of phenytoin and carbamazepine increases zonisamide plasma clearance from 0.30 to 0.35 mL/min/kg to 0.35 to 0.5 mL/min/kg. The half-life of zonisamide is decreased to 27 hours by phenytoin, to 38 hours by phenobarbital and carbamazepine, and to 46 hours by valproate. Plasma protein binding of phenytoin and carbamazepine was not affected by zonisamide administration (see <a href="#i4i_interactions_id_drug-interactions">PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions</a>).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Interactions of Zonisamide with Other Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors:</span><br><br>Concomitant use of zonisamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, with any other carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (e.g., topiramate, acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide), may increase the severity of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span> and may also increase the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201620" conceptname="Kidney stone">kidney stone</span> formation.

<h2>Clinical Studies</h2>
<p class="First">The effectiveness of zonisamide as adjunctive therapy (added to other antiepilepsy drugs) has been established in three multicenter, placebo-controlled, double blind, 3-month clinical trials (two domestic, one European) in 499 patients with refractory partial onset <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> with or without secondary generalization. Each patient had a history of at least four partial onset <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> per month in spite of receiving one or two antiepilepsy drugs at therapeutic concentrations. The 499 patients (209 women, 290 men) ranged in age from 13 to 68 years with a mean age of about 35 years. In the two U.S. studies, over 80% of patients were Caucasian; 100% of patients in the European study were Caucasian. Zonisamide or placebo was added to the existing therapy. The primary measure of effectiveness was median percent reduction from baseline in partial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> frequency. The secondary measure was proportion of patients achieving a 50% or greater <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> reduction from baseline (responders). The results described below are for all <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106574" conceptname="Partial seizure">partial seizures</span> in the intent-to-treat populations.</p>
<p>In the first study (n = 203), all patients had a 1-month baseline observation period, then received placebo or zonisamide in one of two dose escalation regimens; either 1) 100 mg/day for 5 weeks, 200 mg/day for one week, 300 mg/day for one week, and then 400 mg/day for 5 weeks; or 2) 100 mg/day for one week, followed by 200 mg/day for 5 weeks, then 300 mg/day for one week, then 400 mg/day for 5 weeks. This design allowed a 100 mg vs. placebo comparison over weeks 1 to 5, and a 200 mg vs. placebo comparison over weeks 2 to 6; the primary comparison was 400 mg (both escalation groups combined) vs. placebo over weeks 8 to 12. The total daily dose was given as twice a day dosing. Statistically significant treatment differences favoring zonisamide were seen for doses of 100, 200, and 400 mg/day.</p>
<p>In the second (n = 152) and third (n = 138) studies, patients had a 2 to 3 month baseline, then were randomly assigned to placebo or zonisamide for 3 months. Zonisamide was introduced by administering 100 mg/day for the first week, 200 mg/day the second week, then 400 mg/day for 2 weeks, after which the dose (zonisamide or placebo) could be adjusted as necessary to a maximum dose of 20 mg/kg/day or a maximum plasma level of 40 mcg/mL. In the second study, the total daily dose was given as twice a day dosing; in the third study, it was given as a single daily dose. The average final maintenance doses received in the studies were 530 and 430 mg/day in the second and third studies, respectively. Both studies demonstrated statistically significant differences favoring zonisamide for doses of 400 to 600 mg/day, and there was no apparent difference between once daily and twice daily dosing (in different studies). Analysis of the data (first 4 weeks) during titration demonstrated statistically significant differences favoring zonisamide at doses between 100 and 400 mg/day. The primary comparison in both trials was for any dose over Weeks 5 to 12.</p>

Thus, in a display of this type, the curve for an effective treatment is shifted to the left of the curve for placebo. The proportion of patients achieving any particular level of reduction in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> rate was consistently higher for the zonisamide groups compared to the placebo groups.

<h2>Oligohidrosis and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4178904" conceptname="Body temperature above reference range">Hyperthermia</span> in Pediatric Patients</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Oligohidrosis, sometimes resulting in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4181404" conceptname="Heat stroke">heat stroke</span> and hospitalization, is seen in association with zonisamide in pediatric patients.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">During the pre-approval development program in Japan, one case of oligohidrosis was reported in 403 pediatric patients, an incidence of 1 case per 285 patient-years of exposure. While there were no cases reported in the U.S. or European development programs, fewer than 100 pediatric patients participated in these trials.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">In the first 11 years of marketing in Japan, 38 cases were reported, an estimated reporting rate of about 1 case per 10,000 patient-years of exposure. In the first year of marketing in the U.S., 2 cases were reported, an estimated reporting rate of about 12 cases per 10,000 patient-years of exposure. These rates are underestimates of the true incidence because of under-reporting. There has also been one report of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4181404" conceptname="Heat stroke">heat stroke</span> in an 18 year old patient in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Decreased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span> and an elevation in body temperature above normal characterized these cases. Many cases were reported after exposure to elevated environmental temperatures. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4181404" conceptname="Heat stroke">Heat stroke</span>, requiring hospitalization, was diagnosed in some cases. There have been no reported <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span>.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pediatric patients appear to be at an increased risk for zonisamide-associated oligohidrosis and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4178904" conceptname="Body temperature above reference range">hyperthermia</span>. Patients, especially pediatric patients, treated with zonisamide should be monitored closely for evidence of decreased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span> and increased body temperature, especially in warm or hot weather. Caution should be used when zonisamide is prescribed with other drugs that predispose patients to heat-related disorders; these drugs include, but are not limited to, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and drugs with anticholinergic activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">The practitioner should be aware that the safety and effectiveness of zonisamide in pediatric patients have not been established, and that zonisamide is not approved for use in pediatric patients.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322252" conceptname="Suicidal behavior">Suicidal Behavior</span> and Ideation<br></span> <br>Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including zonisamide capsules, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. <br><br>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322252" conceptname="Suicidal behavior">suicidal behavior</span> or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>. </p>
<p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. <br><br>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. <br><br>Table 3 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.<br><br></p>

Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. <br><br>Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm.

<p class="First">Women of childbearing potential who are given zonisamide should be advised to use effective contraception. Zonisamide was teratogenic in mice, rats, and dogs and embryolethal in monkeys when administered during the period of organogenesis. A variety of fetal abnormalities, including cardiovascular defects, and embryo-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079844" conceptname="Fetal death">fetal deaths</span> occurred at maternal plasma levels similar to or lower than therapeutic levels in humans. These findings suggest that the use of zonisamide during pregnancy in humans may present a significant risk to the fetus (see <a href="#i4i_pregnancy_id_pregnancy">PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy</a>). Zonisamide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<h2>Cognitive/Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events</h2>
<p class="First">Use of zonisamide was frequently associated with central nervous system-related adverse events. The most significant of these can be classified into three general categories: 1) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4294810" conceptname="Psychiatric symptom">psychiatric symptoms</span>, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychosis</span>, 2) psychomotor slowing, difficulty with concentration, and speech or language problems, in particular, word-finding difficulties, and 3) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span>.</p>
<p>In placebo-controlled trials, 2.2% of patients discontinued zonisamide or were hospitalized for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> compared to 0.4% of placebo patients. Among all <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> patients treated with zonisamide, 1.4% were discontinued and 1% were hospitalized because of reported <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4219484" conceptname="Suicide attempt">suicide attempts</span>.

<p>Psychomotor slowing and difficulty with concentration occurred in the first month of treatment and were associated with doses above 300 mg/day. Speech and language problems tended to occur after 6 to 10 weeks of treatment and at doses above 300 mg/day.

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201620" conceptname="Kidney stone">Kidney Stones</span></h2>
<p class="First">Among 991 patients treated during the development of zonisamide, 40 patients (4%) with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> receiving zonisamide developed clinically possible or confirmed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201620" conceptname="Kidney stone">kidney stones</span> (e.g., clinical symptomatology, sonography, etc.), a rate of 34 per 1,000 patient-years of exposure (40 patients with 1,168 years of exposure). Of these, 12 were symptomatic, and 28 were described as possible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201620" conceptname="Kidney stone">kidney stones</span> based on sonographic detection. In nine patients, the diagnosis was confirmed by a passage of a stone or by a definitive sonographic finding. The rate of occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201620" conceptname="Kidney stone">kidney stones</span> was 28.7 per 1,000 patient-years of exposure in the first 6 months, 62.6 per 1,000 patient-years of exposure between 6 and 12 months, and 24.3 per 1,000 patient-years of exposure after 12 months of use. There are no normative sonographic data available for either the general population or patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>. Although the clinical significance of the sonographic findings may not be certain, the development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201620" conceptname="Kidney stone">nephrolithiasis</span> may be related to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span> (see <a href="#i4i_warnings_id_warnings">WARNINGS</a>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">Metabolic Acidosis</span> subsection).. The analyzed stones were composed of calcium or urate salts. In general, increasing fluid intake and urine output can help reduce the risk of stone formation, particularly in those with predisposing risk factors. It is unknown, however, whether these measures will reduce the risk of stone formation in patients treated with zonisamide.</p>

<h2>Effect on Renal Function</h2>
<p class="First">In several clinical studies, zonisamide was associated with a statistically significant 8% mean increase from baseline of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) compared to essentially no change in the placebo patients. The increase appeared to persist over time but was not progressive; this has been interpreted as an effect on glomerular filtration rate (GFR). There were no episodes of unexplained <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span> in clinical development in the U.S., Europe, or Japan. The decrease in GFR appeared within the first 4 weeks of treatment. In a 30-day study, the GFR returned to baseline within 2 to 3 weeks of drug discontinuation. There is no information about reversibility, after drug discontinuation, of the effects on GFR after long-term use. Zonisamide should be discontinued in patients who develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span> or a clinically significant sustained increase in the creatinine/BUN concentration. Zonisamide should not be used in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> (estimated GFR &lt; 50 mL/min) as there has been insufficient experience concerning drug dosing and toxicity.</p>

<h3><span class="Italics">Effects of Other Drugs on Zonisamide Pharmacokinetics</span></h3>
<p class="First">Drugs that induce liver enzymes increase the metabolism and clearance of zonisamide and decrease its half-life.

<h3>Interaction with Cimetidine</h3>
<p class="First">Zonisamide single dose pharmacokinetic parameters were not affected by cimetidine (300 mg four times a day for 12 days).<br><br>Drug Interactions with CNS Depressants: Concomitant administration of zonisamide and alcohol or other CNS depressant drugs has not been evaluated in clinical studies. Because of the potential of zonisamide to cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span>, as well as other cognitive and/or neuropsychiatric adverse events, zonisamide should be used with caution if used in combination with alcohol or other CNS depressants. <br><br>Other Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors: Concomitant use of zonisamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, with any other carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (e.g., topiramate, acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide), may increase the severity of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span> and may also increase the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201620" conceptname="Kidney stone">kidney stone</span> formation.

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">No evidence of carcinogenicity was found in mice or rats following dietary administration of zonisamide for 2 years at doses of up to 80 mg/kg/day. In mice, this dose is approximately equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 400 mg/day on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. In rats, this dose is 1 to 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p>
<p>Zonisamide was mutagenic in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in CHL cells. Zonisamide was not mutagenic or clastogenic in other in vitro assays (Ames, mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> tk assay, chromosomal aberration in human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span>) or in the in vivo rat bone marrow cytogenetics assay.</p>
<p>Rats treated with zonisamide (20, 60, or 200 mg/kg) before mating and during the initial gestation phase showed signs of reproductive toxicity (decreased corpora lutea, implantations, and live fetuses) at all doses.

Pregnant patients should be monitored for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span> and treated as in the non-pregnant state. (See <a href="#i4i_warnings_id_warnings">WARNINGS</a>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">Metabolic Acidosis</span> subsection.) 　 <br><br>Newborns of mothers treated with zonisamide should be monitored for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span> because of transfer of zonisamide to the fetus and possible occurrence of transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span> following birth.

Fetal abnormalities or embryo-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079844" conceptname="Fetal death">fetal deaths</span> occurred in these species at zonisamide dosage and maternal plasma levels similar to or lower than therapeutic levels in humans, indicating that use of this drug in pregnancy entails a significant risk to the fetus. A variety of external, visceral, and skeletal malformations was produced in animals by prenatal exposure to zonisamide. Cardiovascular defects were prominent in both rats and dogs.</p>
<p>Following administration of zonisamide (10, 30, or 60 mg/kg/day) to pregnant dogs during organogenesis, increased incidences of fetal cardiovascular malformations (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434462" conceptname="Ventricular septal defect">ventricular septal defects</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314658" conceptname="Cardiomegaly">cardiomegaly</span>, various valvular and arterial anomalies) were found at doses of 30 mg/kg/day or greater. The low effect dose for malformations produced peak maternal plasma zonisamide levels (25 mcg/mL) about 0.5 times the highest plasma levels measured in patients receiving the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 400 mg/day. In dogs, cardiovascular malformations were found in approximately 50% of all fetuses exposed to the high dose, which was associated with maternal plasma levels (44 mcg/mL) approximately equal to the highest levels measured in humans receiving the MRHD. Incidences of skeletal malformations were also increased at the high dose, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80204" conceptname="Fetal growth restriction">fetal growth retardation</span> and increased frequencies of skeletal variations were seen at all doses in this study. The low dose produced maternal plasma levels (12 mcg/mL) about 0.25 times the highest human levels.</p>
<p>In cynomolgus monkeys, administration of zonisamide (10 or 20 mg/kg/day) to pregnant animals during organogenesis resulted in embryo-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079844" conceptname="Fetal death">fetal deaths</span> at both doses. The possibility that these <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> were due to malformations cannot be ruled out. The lowest embryolethal dose in monkeys was associated with peak maternal plasma zonisamide levels (5 mcg/mL) approximately 0.1 times the highest levels measured in patients at the MRHD.</p>
<p>In a mouse embryo-fetal development study, treatment of pregnant animals with zonisamide (125, 250, or 500 mg/kg/day) during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079975" conceptname="Congenital malformation">fetal malformations</span> (skeletal and/or craniofacial defects) at all doses tested. The low dose in this study is approximately 1.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. In rats, increased frequencies of malformations (cardiovascular defects) and variations (persistent cords of thymic tissue, decreased skeletal ossification) were observed among the offspring of dams treated with zonisamide (20, 60, or 200 mg/kg/day) throughout organogenesis at all doses. The low effect dose is approximately 0.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p>
<p>Perinatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> was increased among the offspring of rats treated with zonisamide (10, 30, or 60 mg/kg/day) from the latter part of gestation up to weaning at the high dose, or approximately 1.4 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. The no effect level of 30 mg/kg/day is approximately 0.7 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Zonisamide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.<br><br>To provide information regarding the effects of in utero exposure to zonisamide capsules, physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking zonisamide capsules enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/.</p>

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of zonisamide in children under age 16 have not been established. Cases of oligohidrosis and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260205" conceptname="Hyperpyrexia">hyperpyrexia</span> have been reported (see <a href="#i4i_section_id_olig">WARNINGS: Oligohidrosis and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4178904" conceptname="Body temperature above reference range">Hyperthermia</span> in Pediatric Patients</a>). <br><br>Zonisamide commonly causes <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span> in pediatric patients (see <a href="#i4i_warnings_id_warnings">WARNINGS</a>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">Metabolic Acidosis</span> subsection).

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Single dose pharmacokinetic parameters are similar in elderly and young healthy volunteers (see <a href="#i4i_section_id_special-pop">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations</a>). </p>
<p>Clinical studies of zonisamide did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">The most commonly observed adverse events related to treatment with zonisamide capsules (an incidence at least 4% greater than placebo) in controlled clinical trials and shown in descending order of frequency were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">anorexia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437584" conceptname="Ataxia">ataxia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, and difficulty with memory and/or concentration.</p>
<p>In controlled clinical trials, 12% of patients receiving zonisamide as adjunctive therapy discontinued due to an adverse event compared to 6% receiving placebo. Approximately 21% of the 1,336 patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> who received zonisamide in clinical studies discontinued treatment because of an adverse event.

<h2>Adverse Event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials</h2>
<p class="First">Table 4 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with zonisamide in controlled clinical trials that were numerically more common in the zonisamide group. In these studies, either zonisamide or placebo was added to the patient's current AED therapy. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity.</p>
<p>The prescriber should be aware that these figures, obtained when zonisamide was added to concurrent AED therapy, cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice when patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescriber with one basis by which to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied.</p>

<h2>Other Adverse Events Observed During Clinical Trials</h2>
<p class="First">Zonisamide has been administered to 1,598 individuals during all clinical trials, only some of which were placebo-controlled. During these trials, all events were recorded by the investigators using their own terms. To provide a useful estimate of the proportion of individuals having adverse events, similar events have been grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary. The frequencies represent the proportion of the 1,598 individuals exposed to zonisamide who experienced an event on at least one occasion.

<p class="First">The abuse and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> potential of zonisamide has not been evaluated in human studies (see <a href="#i4i_section_id_cognitive">WARNINGS: Cognitive/Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events</a>). In a series of animal studies, zonisamide did not demonstrate abuse liability and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> potential. Monkeys did not self-administer zonisamide in a standard reinforcing paradigm.

<h2>Human Experience</h2>
<p class="First">Experience with zonisamide daily doses over 800 mg/day is limited. During zonisamide clinical development, three patients ingested unknown amounts of zonisamide as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4219484" conceptname="Suicide attempt">suicide attempts</span>, and all three were hospitalized with CNS symptoms. One patient became <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">comatose</span> and developed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>; the zonisamide plasma level was 100.1 mcg/mL measured 31 hours post-ingestion. Zonisamide plasma levels fell with a half-life of 57 hours, and the patient became alert 5 days later.</p>

<h2>Management</h2>
<p class="First">No specific antidotes for zonisamide overdosage are available. Following a suspected recent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> should be induced or gastric lavage performed with the usual precautions to protect the airway. General supportive care is indicated, including frequent monitoring of vital signs and close observation.</p>
<p>Zonisamide has a long half-life (see <a href="#i4i_clinical_pharmacology_id_clinical-pharm">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>). Due to the low protein binding of zonisamide (40%), renal dialysis may not be effective. A poison control center should be contacted for information on the management of zonisamide overdosage.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Zonisamide Capsules are recommended as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106574" conceptname="Partial seizure">partial seizures</span> in adults. Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients below the age of 16 have not been established. Zonisamide Capsules should be administered once or twice daily, except for the daily dose of 100 mg at the initiation of therapy. Zonisamide Capsules is given orally and can be taken with or without food. Capsules should be swallowed whole.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">

<h2>Adults Over Age 16</h2>
<p class="First">The prescriber should be aware that, because of the long half-life of zonisamide, up to 2 weeks may be required to achieve steady-state levels upon reaching a stable dose or following dosage adjustment. Although the regimen described below is one that has been shown to be tolerated, the prescriber may wish to prolong the duration of treatment at the lower doses in order to fully assess the effects of zonisamide at steady-state, noting that many of the side effects of zonisamide are more frequent at doses of 300 mg per day and above. Although there is some evidence of greater response at doses above 100 to 200 mg/day, the increase appears small and formal dose-response studies have not been conducted.</p>
<p>The initial dose of zonisamide capsules should be 100 mg daily. After 2 weeks, the dose may be increased to 200 mg/day for at least 2 weeks. It can be increased to 300 mg/day and 400 mg/day, with the dose stable for at least 2 weeks to achieve steady-state at each level. Evidence from controlled trials suggests that zonisamide capsule doses of 100 to 600 mg/day are effective, but there is no suggestion of increasing response above 400 mg/day (see <a href="#i4i_clinical_studies_id_clinical-studies">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Studies</a>). There is little experience with doses greater than 600 mg/day.</p>

<h2>Patients with Renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic Disease</span></h2>
