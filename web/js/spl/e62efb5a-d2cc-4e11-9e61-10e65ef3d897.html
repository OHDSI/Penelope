<h2>Mechanism of Action </h2>
<p class="First">Although the etiology of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443432" conceptname="Impaired cognition">cognitive impairment</span> in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not fully understood, it has been reported that acetylcholine-producing neurons degenerate in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. The degree of this cholinergic loss has been correlated with degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443432" conceptname="Impaired cognition">cognitive impairment</span> and density of amyloid plaques (a neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease). </p>
<p>Galantamine, a tertiary alkaloid, is a competitive and reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase. While the precise mechanism of galantamine's action is unknown, it is postulated to exert its therapeutic effect by enhancing cholinergic function. This is accomplished by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine through reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052720" conceptname="Acetylcholinesterase">cholinesterase</span>. If this mechanism is correct, galantamine's effect may lessen as the disease process advances and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact. There is no evidence that galantamine alters the course of the underlying dementing process. </p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Galantamine is well absorbed with absolute oral bioavailability of about 90%. It has a terminal elimination half-life of about 7 hours and pharmacokinetics are linear over the range of 8-32 mg/day. </p>
<p>The maximum inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity of about 40% was achieved about one hour after a single oral dose of 8 mg galantamine in healthy male subjects. </p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="i4i_section_id_5f31f7dd-c95d-4c42-a2ea-92b8555975fb"></a><a name="section-2.2.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Absorption and Distribution </h3>
<p class="First">Galantamine is rapidly and completely absorbed with time to peak concentration about 1 hour. Bioavailability of the tablet was the same as the bioavailability of an oral solution. Food did not affect the AUC of galantamine but C<span class="Sub">max</span> decreased by 25% and T<span class="Sub">max</span> was delayed by 1.5 hours. The mean volume of distribution of galantamine is 175 L. </p>
<p>The plasma protein binding of galantamine is 18% at therapeutically relevant concentrations. In whole blood, galantamine is mainly distributed to blood cells (52.7%). The blood to plasma concentration ratio of galantamine is 1.2. </p>
</div>

<h3>Metabolism and Elimination </h3>
<p class="First">Galantamine is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, glucuronidated, and excreted unchanged in the urine. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies indicate that cytochrome CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 were the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes involved in the metabolism of galantamine, and inhibitors of both pathways increase oral bioavailability of galantamine modestly (see <span class="Underline"><span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_interactions_id_51e4562d-b20f-4239-9e1f-071bfd248a43">PRECAUTIONS, Drug-Drug Interactions</a></span></span>). O-demethylation, mediated by CYP2D6 was greater in extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 than in poor metabolizers. In plasma from both poor and extensive metabolizers, however, unchanged galantamine and its glucuronide accounted for most of the sample radioactivity. </p>
<p>In studies of oral <span class="Sup">3</span>H-galantamine, unchanged galantamine and its glucuronide, accounted for most plasma radioactivity in poor and extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers. Up to 8 hours post-dose, unchanged galantamine accounted for 39-77% of the total radioactivity in the plasma, and galantamine glucuronide for 14-24%. By 7 days, 93-99% of the radioactivity had been recovered, with about 95% in urine and about 5% in the feces. Total urinary recovery of unchanged galantamine accounted for, on average, 32% of the dose and that of galantamine glucuronide for another 12% on average. </p>
<p>After i.v. or oral administration, about 20% of the dose was excreted as unchanged galantamine in the urine in 24 hours, representing a renal clearance of about 65Â mL/min, about 20-25% of the total plasma clearance of about 300 mL/min. </p>
<p>RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> ER 24 mg Extended-Release Capsules administered once daily under fasting conditions are bioequivalent to RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> Tablets 12 mg twice daily with respect to AUC<span class="Sub">24h</span> and C<span class="Sub">min</span>. The C<span class="Sub">max</span> and T<span class="Sub">max</span> of the extended-release capsules were lower and occurred later, respectively, compared with the immediate-release tablets, with C<span class="Sub">max</span> about 25% lower and median T<span class="Sub">max</span> occurring about 4.5 â€“ 5.0 hours after dosing. Dose-proportionality is observed for RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> ER Extended-Release Capsules over the dose range of 8 to 24 mg daily and steady state is achieved within a week. There was no effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> ER Extended-Release Capsules. CYP2D6 poor metabolizers had drug exposures that were approximately 50% higher than for extensive metabolizers. </p>
<p>There are no appreciable differences in pharmacokinetic parameters when RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> ER Extended-Release Capsules are given with food compared to when they are given in the fasted state. </p>

<h3>CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers </h3>
<p class="First">Approximately 7% of the normal population has a genetic variation that leads to reduced levels of activity of CYP2D6 isozyme. Such individuals have been referred to as poor metabolizers. After a single oral dose of 4 mg or 8 mg galantamine, CYP2D6 poor metabolizers demonstrated a similar C<span class="Sub">max</span> and about 35% AUCâˆž increase of unchanged galantamine compared to extensive metabolizers. </p>
<p>A total of 356 patients with Alzheimer's disease enrolled in two Phase 3 studies were genotyped with respect to CYP2D6 (n=210 hetero-extensive metabolizers, 126Â homo-extensive metabolizers, and 20 poor metabolizers). Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that there was a 25% decrease in median clearance in poor metabolizers compared to extensive metabolizers. Dosage adjustment is not necessary in patients identified as poor metabolizers as the dose of drug is individually titrated to tolerability. </p>

<h3><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic Impairment</span>: </h3>
<p class="First">Following a single 4 mg dose of galantamine tablets, the pharmacokinetics of galantamine in subjects with mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> (n=8; Child-Pugh score of 5-6) were similar to those in healthy subjects. In patients with moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> (n=8;Â Child-Pugh score of 7-9), galantamine clearance was decreased by about 25% compared to normal volunteers.

<h3>Gender and Race: </h3>
<p class="First">No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effect of gender and race on the disposition of RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span>, but a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicates (n= 539 males and 550 females) that galantamine clearance is about 20% lower in females than in males (explained by lower body weight in females) and race (n= 1029 White, 24Â Black, 13 Asian and 23Â other) did not affect the clearance of RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span>. </p>

<p>Multiple metabolic pathways and renal excretion are involved in the elimination of galantamine so no single pathway appears predominant. Based on <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 were the major enzymes involved in the metabolism of galantamine. CYP2D6 was involved in the formation of O-desmethyl-galantamine, whereas CYP3A4 mediated the formation of galantamine-N-oxide. Galantamine is also glucuronidated and excreted unchanged in urine. </p>

<h3>(A) Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span>: </h3>
<p class="First">Drugs that are potent inhibitors for CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 may increase the AUC of galantamine. Multiple dose pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the AUC of galantamine increased 30% and 40%, respectively, during coadministration of ketoconazole and paroxetine. As co-administered with erythromycin, another CYP3A4 inhibitor, the galantamine AUC increased only 10%. Population PK analysis with a database of 852 patients with Alzheimer's disease showed that the clearance of galantamine was decreased about 25-33% by concurrent administration of amitriptyline (n = 17), fluoxetine (n = 48), fluvoxamine (n = 14), and quinidine (nÂ = 7), known inhibitors of CYP2D6. </p>
<p>Concurrent administration of H<span class="Sub">2</span>-antagonists demonstrated that ranitidine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of galantamine, and cimetidine increased the galantamine AUC by approximately 16%.</p>
<p>A multiple dose pharmacokinetic study with concurrent administration of memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, demonstrated that co-administration of memantine in a dose of 10 mg BID did not affect the pharmacokinetic profile of galantamine (16 mg daily) at steady state.</p>

<h3>(B) Effect of RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> on the Metabolism of Other Drugs: </h3>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro </span> studies show that galantamine did not inhibit the metabolic pathways catalyzed by CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP3A4, CYP4A, CYP2C, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1. This indicated that the inhibitory potential of galantamine towards the major forms of cytochrome P450 is very low. Multiple doses of galantamine (24 mg/day) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin and warfarin (R- and S- forms). Galantamine had no effect on the increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time induced by warfarin. </p>

<h1>CLINICAL TRIALS </h1>
<p class="First">The effectiveness of RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> ER/RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (galantamine hydrobromide) as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease is demonstrated by the results of 5 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical investigations in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease, 4 with the immediate-release tablet and 1 with the extended-release capsule [diagnosed by NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, with Mini-Mental State Examination scores that wereâ‰¥ 10 and â‰¤ 24]. Doses studied with the tablet formulation were 8-32 mg/day given as twice daily doses. In 3 of the 4 studies with the tablet, patients were started on a low dose of 8Â mg, then titrated weekly by 8 mg/day to 24 or 32 mg as assigned. In the fourth study (USA 4-week Dose-Escalation Fixed-Dose Study) dose escalation of 8 mg/day occurred over 4 week intervals. The mean age of patients participating in these 4Â RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> trials was 75 years with a range of 41 to 100. Approximately 62% of patients were women and 38% were men. The racial distribution was White 94%, Black 3% and other races 3%. Two other studies examined a three times daily dosing regimen; these also showed or suggested benefit but did not suggest an advantage over twice daily dosing. </p>

<h2>Study Outcome Measures: </h2>
<p class="First">In each study, the primary effectiveness of RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> was evaluated using a dual outcome assessment strategy as measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog) and the Clinician's Interview Based Impression of Change that required the use of caregiver information (CIBIC-plus). </p>
<p>The ability of RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> to improve cognitive performance was assessed with the cognitive sub-scale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog), a multi-item instrument that has been extensively validated in longitudinal cohorts of Alzheimer's disease patients. The ADAS-cog examines selected aspects of cognitive performance including elements of memory, orientation, attention, reasoning, language and praxis. The ADAS-cog scoring range is from 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443432" conceptname="Impaired cognition">cognitive impairment</span>. Elderly normal adults may score as low as 0Â or 1, but it is not unusual for non-demented adults to score slightly higher. </p>
<p>The patients recruited as participants in each study using the tablet formulation had mean scores on ADAS-cog of approximately 27 units, with a range from 5 to 69. Experience gained in longitudinal studies of ambulatory patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease suggests that they gain 6 to 12 units a year on the ADAS-cog. Lesser degrees of change, however, are seen in patients with very mild or very advanced disease because the ADAS-cog is not uniformly sensitive to change over the course of the disease. The annualized rate of decline in the placebo patients participating in RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> trials was approximately 4.5 units per year. </p>
<p>The ability of RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> to produce an overall clinical effect was assessed using a Clinician's Interview Based Impression of Change that required the use of caregiver information, the CIBIC-plus. The CIBIC-plus is not a single instrument and is not a standardized instrument like the ADAS-cog. Clinical trials for investigational drugs have used a variety of CIBIC formats, each different in terms of depth and structure. As such, results from a CIBIC-plus reflect clinical experience from the trial or trials in which it was used and cannot be compared directly with the results of CIBIC-plus evaluations from other clinical trials. The CIBIC-plus used in the trials was a semi-structured instrument based on a comprehensive evaluation at baseline and subsequent time-points of 4 major areas of patient function: general, cognitive, behavioral and activities of daily living. It represents the assessment of a skilled clinician based on his/her observation at an interview with the patient, in combination with information supplied by a caregiver familiar with the behavior of the patient over the interval rated. The CIBIC-plus is scored as a seven point categorical rating, ranging from a score of 1, indicating â€œmarkedly improved,â€? to a score of 4, indicating â€œno changeâ€? to a score of 7, indicating â€œmarked worsening.â€? The CIBIC-plus has not been systematically compared directly to assessments not using information from caregivers (CIBIC) or other global methods. </p>

<h4>Effects on the ADAS-cog: </h4>
<p class="First"><span class="Underline">Figure 1</span> illustrates the time course for the change from baseline in ADAS-cog scores for all four dose groups over the 21 weeks of the study. At 21 weeks of treatment, the mean differences in the ADAS-cog change scores for the RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span>-treated patients compared to the patients on placebo were 1.7, 3.3, and 3.6 units for the 8,Â 16Â and 24 mg/day treatments, respectively. The 16Â mg/day and 24 mg/day treatments were statistically significantly superior to placebo and to the 8 mg/day treatment. There was no statistically significant difference between the 16 mg/day and 24Â mg/day dose groups. </p>

<h2>Extended-Release Capsules </h2>
<p class="First">The efficacy of RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> ER Extended-Release Capsules was studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial which was 6 months in duration, and had an initial 4-week dose-escalation phase.

The primary efficacy measures in this study were the ADAS-cog and CIBIC-plus. On the protocol-specified primary efficacy analysis at Month 6, a statistically significant improvement favoring RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> ER over placebo was seen for the ADAS-cog, but not for the CIBIC-plus. RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> ER showed a statistically significant improvement when compared with placebo on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) scale, a measure of function, and a secondary efficacy measure in this study. The effects of both RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> ER Capsules and RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> Tablets on the ADAS-cog, CIBIC-plus, and ADCS-ADL were similar in this study. </p>

<h2>Cardiovascular Conditions </h2>
<p class="First">Because of their pharmacological action, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052720" conceptname="Acetylcholinesterase">cholinesterase</span> inhibitors have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, leading to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316135" conceptname="Atrioventricular block">AV block</span>. These actions may be particularly important to patients with supraventricular cardiac conduction disorders or to patients taking other drugs concomitantly that significantly slow heart rate. Postmarketing surveillance of marketed anticholinesterase inhibitors has shown, however, that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span> and all types of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316135" conceptname="Atrioventricular block">heart block</span> have been reported in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Therefore all patients should be considered at risk for adverse effects on cardiac conduction. </p>
<p>In randomized controlled trials, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span> was reported more frequently in galantamine-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients, but was rarely severe and rarely led to treatment discontinuation. The overall frequency of this event was 2-3% for galantamine doses up to 24 mg/day compared with &lt;1% for placebo. No increased incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316135" conceptname="Atrioventricular block">heart block</span> was observed at the recommended doses. </p>

<h2>Information for Patients and Caregivers: </h2>
<p class="First">Caregivers should be instructed about the recommended dosage and administration of RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> ER/RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (galantamine hydrobromide). RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> ER Extended-Release Capsules should be administered once daily in the morning, preferably with food (although not required). RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> Tablets and Oral Solution should be administered twice per day, preferably with the morning and evening meals. Dose escalation (dose increases) should follow a minimum of four weeks at prior dose. </p>
<p>Patients and caregivers should be advised that the most frequent adverse events associated with use of the drug can be minimized by following the recommended dosage and administration. </p>
<p>Patients and caregivers should be advised to ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment. If therapy has been interrupted for several days or longer, the patient should be restarted at the lowest dose and the dose escalated to the current dose. </p>
<p>Caregivers should be instructed in the correct procedure for administering RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> Oral Solution. In addition, they should be informed of the existence of an Instruction Sheet (included with the product) describing how the solution is to be administered. They should be urged to read this sheet prior to administering RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> Oral Solution. Caregivers should direct questions about the administration of the solution to either their physician or pharmacist. </p>

<p class="First">In two randomized placebo controlled trials of 2 years duration in subjects with mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443432" conceptname="Impaired cognition">cognitive impairment</span> (MCI), a total of 13 subjects on RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (n=1026) and 1 subject on placebo (n=1022) died. The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> were due to various causes which could be expected in an elderly population; about half of the RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> appeared to result from various vascular causes (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4132309" conceptname="Sudden death">sudden death</span>). </p>
<p>Although the difference in mortality between RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> and placebo-treated groups in these two studies was significant, the results are highly discrepant with other studies of RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span>. Specifically, in these two MCI studies, the mortality rate in the placebo-treated subjects was markedly lower than the rate in placebo-treated patients in trials of RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> in Alzheimer's disease or other <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4182210" conceptname="Dementia">dementias</span> (0.7 per 1000 person years compared to 22-61 per 1000 person years, respectively). Although the mortality rate in the RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span>-treated MCI subjects was also lower than that observed in RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span>-treated patients in Alzheimer's disease and other <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4182210" conceptname="Dementia">dementia</span> trials (10.2 per 1000 person years compared to 23-31 per 1000 person years, respectively), the relative difference was much less. When the Alzheimer's disease and other <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4182210" conceptname="Dementia">dementia</span> studies were pooled (n=6000), the mortality rate in the placebo group numerically exceeded that in the RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> group. Furthermore, in the MCI studies, no subjects in the placebo group died after 6 months, a highly unexpected finding in this population. </p>

<p class="First">Pregnancy Category B: In a study in which rats were dosed from day 14 (females) or day 60 (males) prior to mating through the period of organogenesis, a slightly increased incidence of skeletal variations was observed at doses of 8 mg/kg/day (3Â times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose [MRHD] on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) and 16 mg/kg/day. In a study in which pregnant rats were dosed from the beginning of organogenesis through day 21 post-partum, pup weights were decreased at 8 and 16Â mg/kg/day, but no adverse effects on other postnatal developmental parameters were seen. The doses causing the above effects in rats produced slight maternal toxicity. No major malformations were caused in rats given up to 16 mg/kg/day. No drug related teratogenic effects were observed in rabbits given up to 40 mg/kg/day (32 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) during the period of organogenesis. </p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> in pregnant women. RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. </p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers </h2>
<p class="First">It is not known whether galantamine is excreted in human breast milk. RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> has no indication for use in nursing mothers. </p>

<h2>Pediatric Use </h2>
<p class="First">There are no adequate and well-controlled trials documenting the safety and efficacy of galantamine in any illness occurring in children. Therefore, use of RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> in children is not recommended. </p>

<h2>Pre-Marketing Clinical Trial Experience: </h2>
<p class="First">The specific adverse event data described in this section are based on studies of the immediate-release tablet formulation. In clinical trials, once-daily treatment with RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> ER (galantamine hydrobromide) Extended-Release Capsules was well tolerated and adverse events were similar to those seen with RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> Tablets. </p>

<h3>Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation: </h3>
<p class="First">In two large scale, placebo-controlled trials of 6 months duration in which patients were titrated weekly from 8 to 16 to 24, and to 32 mg/day, the risk of discontinuation because of an adverse event in the galantamine group exceeded that in the placebo group by about threefold. In contrast, in a 5-month trial with escalation of the dose by 8 mg/day every 4 weeks, the overall risk of discontinuation because of an adverse event was 7%, 7%, and 10% for the placebo, galantamine 16 mg/day, and galantamine 24 mg/day groups, respectively, with gastrointestinal adverse effects the principle reason for discontinuing galantamine. <span class="Underline"><a href="#id_0d9e4e5e-7a76-41ae-a506-e00f354cd0a8">Table 1</a></span> shows the most frequent adverse events leading to discontinuation in this study. </p>

<h3>Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials: </h3>
<p class="First">The reported adverse events in trials using RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (galantamine hydrobromide) Tablets reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions in a highly selected patient population. In actual practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior and the types of patients treated may differ. </p>
<p>The majority of these adverse events occurred during the dose-escalation period. In those patients who experienced the most frequent adverse event, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, the median duration of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> was 5-7 days. </p>
<p>Administration of RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> with food, the use of anti-emetic medication, and ensuring adequate fluid intake may reduce the impact of these events. </p>
<p>The most frequent adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% and at least twice the rate on placebo with the recommended maintenance dose of either 16 or 24 mg/day of RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> under conditions of every 4-week dose-escalation for each dose increment of 8 mg/day, are shown in <span class="Underline"><a href="#id_d51fbc15-09dc-4103-9472-c2d6fe625271">Table 2</a></span>. These events were primarily gastrointestinal and tended to be less frequent with the 16Â mg/day recommended initial maintenance dose. </p>

<h3>Other Adverse Events Observed During Clinical Trials </h3>
<p class="First">RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> Tablets were administered to 3055 patients with Alzheimer's disease. A total of 2357 patients received galantamine in placebo-controlled trials and 761 patients with Alzheimer's disease received galantamine 24 mg/day, the maximum recommended maintenance dose. About 1000 patients received galantamine for at least one year and approximately 200 patients received galantamine for two years. </p>
<p>To establish the rate of adverse events, data from all patients receiving any dose of galantamine in 8 placebo-controlled trials and 6 open-label extension trials were pooled. The methodology to gather and codify these adverse events was standardized across trials, using WHO terminology. All adverse events occurring in approximately 0.1% are included, except for those already listed elsewhere in labeling, WHO terms too general to be informative, or events unlikely to be drug caused. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare adverse events - those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo-treated patients in the controlled studies.

<h1>OVERDOSAGE </h1>
<p class="First">Because strategies for the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> are continually evolving, it is advisable to contact a poison control center to determine the latest recommendations for the management of an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> of any drug. </p>
<p>As in any case of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, general supportive measures should be utilized. Signs and symptoms of significant overdosing of galantamine are predicted to be similar to those of overdosing of other cholinomimetics. These effects generally involve the central nervous system, the parasympathetic nervous system, and the neuromuscular junction. In addition to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79908" conceptname="Muscle weakness">muscle weakness</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4189159" conceptname="Muscle fibrillation">fasciculations</span>, some or all of the following signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4311957" conceptname="Cholinergic crisis">cholinergic crisis</span> may develop: severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, gastrointestinal cramping, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4207204" conceptname="Excessive salivation">salivation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435553" conceptname="Epiphora">lacrimation</span>, urination, defecation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, collapse and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>. Increasing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79908" conceptname="Muscle weakness">muscle weakness</span> is a possibility and may result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> if respiratory muscles are involved. </p>
<p>Tertiary anticholinergics such as atropine may be used as an antidote for RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (galantamine hydrobromide) overdosage. Intravenous atropine sulfate titrated to effect is recommended at an initial dose of 0.5 to 1.0 mg i.v. with subsequent doses based upon clinical response. Atypical responses in blood pressure and heart rate have been reported with other cholinomimetics when coadministered with quaternary anticholinergics. It is not known whether RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> and/or its metabolites can be removed by dialysis (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or hemofiltration). Dose-related signs of toxicity in animals included <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4139968" conceptname="Underactive">hypoactivity</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremors</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4265182" conceptname="Clonic seizure">clonic convulsions</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4207204" conceptname="Excessive salivation">salivation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435553" conceptname="Epiphora">lacrimation</span>, chromodacryorrhea, mucoid feces, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">dyspnea</span>. </p>
<p>In one postmarketing report, one patient who had been taking 4 mg of galantamine daily for a week inadvertently ingested eight 4 mg tablets (32 mg total) on a single day. Subsequently, she developed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>, QT prolongation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">ventricular tachycardia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135823" conceptname="Torsades de pointes">torsades de pointes</span> accompanied by a brief <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372448" conceptname="Loss of consciousness">loss of consciousness</span> for which she required hospital treatment.

One patient who was prescribed 24 mg/day and had a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span> over the previous two years, mistakenly received 24 mg twice daily for 34 days and developed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span> requiring hospitalization. Another patient, who was prescribed 16 mg/day of oral solution, inadvertently ingested 160 mg (40 mL) and experienced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>, and near-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">syncope</span> one hour later, which necessitated hospital treatment.

<h2>RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> ER Extended-Release Capsules</h2>
<p class="First">The dosage of RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> ER (galantamine hydrobromide) Extended-Release Capsules was shown to be effective in a controlled clinical trial is 16-24mg/day.</p>
<p>The recommended starting dose of RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> ER is 8 mg/day. The dose should be increased to the initial maintenance dose of 16 mg/day after a minimum of 4 weeks. A further increase to 24Â mg/day should be attempted after a minimum of 4 weeks at 16 mg/day. Dose increases should be based upon assessment of clinical benefit and tolerability of the previous dose.</p>
<p>RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> ER should be administered once daily in the morning, preferably with food.</p>
<p>Patients currently being treated with RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> tablets can convert to RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> ER by taking their last dose of RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> tablets in the evening and starting RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> ER once daily treatment the next morning. Converting from RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> to RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> ER should occur at the same total daily dose.</p>

<h2>RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> Immediate-Release Tablets</h2>
<p class="First">The dosage of RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> Tablets was shown to be effective in controlled clinical trials is 16-32 mg/day given as twice daily dosing. As the dose of 32 mg/day is less well tolerated than lower doses and does not provide increased effectiveness, the recommended dose range is 16-24 mg/day given in a BID regimen. The dose of 24 mg/day did not provide a statistically significant greater clinical benefit than 16 mg/day. It is possible, however, that a daily dose of 24 mg of RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> might provide additional benefit for some patients.</p>
<p>The recommended starting dose of RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> Tablets and Oral Solution is 4 mg twice a day (8 mg/day). The dose should be increased to the initial maintenance dose of 8 mg twice a day (16Â mg/day) after a minimum of 4 weeks. A further increase to 12 mg twice a day (24Â mg/day) should be attempted after a minimum of 4 weeks at 8 mg twice a day (16Â mg/day). Dose increases should be based upon assessment of clinical benefit and tolerability of the previous dose.</p>
<p>RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> Tablets and Oral Solution should be administered twice a day, preferably with morning and evening meals.</p>
<p>Patients and caregivers should be advised to ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment. If therapy has been interrupted for several days or longer, the patient should be restarted at the lowest dose and the dose escalated to the current dose.</p>
<p>Caregivers should be instructed in the correct procedure for administering RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> Oral Solution. In addition, they should be informed of the existence of an Instruction Sheet (included with the product) describing how the solution is to be administered. They should be urged to read this sheet prior to administering RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> Oral Solution. Caregivers should direct questions about the administration of the solution to either their physician or pharmacist.</p>
<p>The abrupt withdrawal of RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> ER/RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> in those patients who had been receiving doses in the effective range was not associated with an increased frequency of adverse events in comparison with those continuing to receive the same doses of that drug. The beneficial effects of RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> ER/RAZADYNE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> are lost, however, when the drug is discontinued.</p>
