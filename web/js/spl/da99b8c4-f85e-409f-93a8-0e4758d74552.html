<p><span class="Bold"> The reported incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span> in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span>. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>, including both intrinsic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span> and renal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4131044" conceptname="Hypoperfusion">hypoperfusion</span>, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications.

The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span> increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span> may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥ 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span>.

<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First"> Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Its pharmacologic mechanisms of action are different from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin hydrochloride decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin does not produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> in either patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> or normal subjects (except in special circumstances, see <a href="#i4i_precautions_ID_precautions">PRECAUTIONS</a>) and does not cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4307509" conceptname="Hyperinsulinism">hyperinsulinemia</span>. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may actually decrease. </p>

<h3><span class="Bold"> Absorption and Bioavailability </span></h3>
<p class="First"> The absolute bioavailability of a metformin hydrochloride 500 mg tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50-60%. Studies using single oral doses of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP of 500 mg to 1500 mg, and 850 mg to 2550 mg, indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination. Food decreases the extent of and slightly delays the absorption of metformin, as shown by approximately a 40% lower mean peak plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>), a 25% lower area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), and a 35 minute prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) following administration of a single 850 mg tablet of metformin with food, compared to the same tablet strength administered fasting. The clinical relevance of these decreases is unknown. </p>

<h3><span class="Bold"> Distribution </span></h3>
<p class="First">The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of 850 mg averaged 654 ± 358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins in contrast to sulfonylureas which are more than 90% protein bound. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP steady state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24-48 hours and are generally &lt; 1 µg/mL. During controlled clinical trials of metformin, maximum metformin plasma levels did not exceed 5 µg/mL, even at maximum doses.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"> Metabolism and Elimination </span></h3>
<p class="First"> Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion. Renal clearance (see Table 1) is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> may be a compartment of distribution. </p>

<h3><span class="Bold"> Patients with Type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">Diabetes</span> </span></h3>
<p class="First">In the presence of normal renal function, there are no differences between single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of metformin between patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> and normal subjects (see Table 1), nor is there any accumulation of metformin in either group at usual clinical doses.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span> </span></h3>
<p class="First"> In patients with decreased renal function (based on measured creatinine clearance), the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased in proportion to the decrease in creatinine clearance (see Table 1; also see <a href="#warnings">WARNINGS</a>). </p>

<h3><span class="Bold"> Geriatrics </span></h3>
<p class="First">Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and C<span class="Sub">max</span> is increased, compared to healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function (see Table 1). Metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥ 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced.

<p>A 29-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of metformin and glyburide, alone and in combination, was conducted in obese patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> patients who had failed to achieve adequate glycemic control while on maximum doses of glyburide (baseline FPG of approximately 250 mg/dL) (see <span class="Bold">Table 3</span>). Patients randomized to the combination arm started therapy with metformin hydrochloride 500 mg and glyburide 20 mg. At the end of each week of the first four weeks of the trial, these patients had their dosages of metformin hydrochloride increased by 500 mg if they had failed to reach target fasting plasma glucose. After week four, such dosage adjustments were made monthly, although no patient was allowed to exceed metformin hydrochloride 2500 mg. Patients in the metformin hydrochloride only arm (metformin plus placebo) followed the same titration schedule. At the end of the trial, approximately 70% of the patients in the combination group were taking metformin hydrochloride 2000 mg/glyburide 20 mg or metformin hydrochloride 2500 mg/glyburide 20 mg. Patients randomized to continue on glyburide experienced worsening of glycemic control, with mean increases in FPG, PPG and HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> of 14 mg/dL, 3 mg/dL and 0.2%, respectively. In contrast, those randomized to metformin (up to 2500 mg/day) experienced a slight improvement, with mean reductions in FPG, PPG and HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> of 1 mg/dL, 6 mg/dL and 0.4%, respectively. The combination of metformin and glyburide was effective in reducing FPG, PPG and HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> levels by 63 mg/dL, 65 mg/dL, and 1.7%, respectively. Compared to results of glyburide treatment alone, the net differences with combination treatment were -77 mg/dL, -68 mg/dL and -1.9%, respectively (see Table 3).</p>

<p> In contrast to sulfonylureas, body weight of individuals on metformin tended to remain stable or even decrease somewhat (see Tables 2 and 3). </p>
<p> A 24-week, double blind, placebo-controlled study of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP plus insulin versus insulin plus placebo was conducted in patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> who failed to achieve adequate glycemic control on insulin alone (see Table 5). Patients randomized to receive metformin hydrochloride plus insulin achieved a reduction in HbA<span class="Sub">1C</span> of 2.10%, compared to a 1.56% reduction in HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> achieved by insulin plus placebo. The improvement in glycemic control was achieved at the final study visit with 16% less insulin, 93.0 U/day vs 110.6 U/day, metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP plus insulin versus insulin plus placebo, respectively, p=0.04. </p>

Thus, patients with serum creatinine levels above the upper limit of normal for their age should not receive metformin. In patients with advanced age, metformin should be carefully titrated to establish the minimum dose for adequate glycemic effect, because aging is associated with reduced renal function. In elderly patients, particularly those ≥ 80 years of age, renal function should be monitored regularly and, generally, metformin should not be titrated to the maximum dose (see <a href="#warnings">WARNINGS</a> and <a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_ID_dosageadmin">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>). </p>
<p> Before initiation of metformin therapy and at least annually thereafter, renal function should be assessed and verified as normal.

<p> The effectiveness of oral antidiabetic drugs in lowering blood glucose to a targeted level decreases in many patients over a period of time. This phenomenon, which may be due to progression of the underlying disease or to diminished responsiveness to the drug, is known as secondary failure, to distinguish it from primary failure in which the drug is ineffective during initial therapy. Should secondary failure occur with metformin or sulfonylurea monotherapy, combined therapy with metformin and sulfonylurea may result in a response. Should secondary failure occur with combined metformin/sulfonylurea therapy, it may be necessary to consider therapeutic alternatives including initiation of insulin therapy. </p>

They should also be informed about the importance of adherence to dietary instructions, of a regular exercise program, and of regular testing of blood glucose, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4123836" conceptname="Glycosylated hemoglobin">glycosylated hemoglobin</span>, renal function and hematologic parameters. </p>
<p> The risks of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span>, its symptoms, and conditions that predispose to its development, as noted in the <a href="#warnings">WARNINGS</a> and <a href="#i4i_precautions_ID_precautions">PRECAUTIONS</a> sections should be explained to patients. Patients should be advised to discontinue metformin immediately and to promptly notify their health practitioner if unexplained <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316814" conceptname="Hyperventilation">hyperventilation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442752" conceptname="Muscle pain">myalgia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4272240" conceptname="Malaise">malaise</span>, unusual <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> or other nonspecific symptoms occur. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302537" conceptname="Digestive system finding">gastrointestinal symptoms</span>, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302537" conceptname="Digestive system finding">gastrointestinal symptoms</span> could be due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span> or other serious disease. </p>
<p> Patients should be counseled against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, while receiving metformin. </p>
<p> Metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP alone does not usually cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>, although it may occur when metformin is used in conjunction with oral sulfonylureas and insulin.

<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First"> Response to all diabetic therapies should be monitored by periodic measurements of fasting blood glucose and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4123836" conceptname="Glycosylated hemoglobin">glycosylated hemoglobin</span> levels, with a goal of decreasing these levels toward the normal range. During initial dose titration, fasting glucose can be used to determine the therapeutic response. Thereafter, both glucose and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4123836" conceptname="Glycosylated hemoglobin">glycosylated hemoglobin</span> should be monitored. Measurements of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4123836" conceptname="Glycosylated hemoglobin">glycosylated hemoglobin</span> may be especially useful for evaluating long-term control (see also <a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_ID_dosageadmin">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>). </p>
<p> Initial and periodic monitoring of hematologic parameters (e.g., hemoglobin/hematocrit and red blood cell indices) and renal function (serum creatinine) should be performed, at least on an annual basis. While <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435789" conceptname="Megaloblastic anemia">megaloblastic anemia</span> has rarely been seen with metformin therapy, if this is suspected, vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency should be excluded. </p>

<h3><span class="Bold">Glyburide</span></h3>
<p class="First">In a single-dose interaction study in type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> patients, co-administration of metformin and glyburide did not result in any changes in either metformin pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. Decreases in glyburide AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> were observed, but were highly variable. The single-dose nature of this study and the lack of correlation between glyburide blood levels and pharmacodynamic effects, makes the clinical significance of this interaction uncertain (see <a href="#i4i_section_ID_dosageadmin_cmh">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Concomitant Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets, USP and Oral Sulfonylurea Therapy in Adult Patients</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="Bold">Furosemide</span></h3>
<p class="First"> A single-dose, metformin-furosemide drug interaction study in healthy subjects demonstrated that pharmacokinetic parameters of both compounds were affected by co-administration. Furosemide increased the metformin plasma and blood C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 22% and blood AUC by 15%, without any significant change in metformin renal clearance. When administered with metformin, the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of furosemide were 31% and 12% smaller, respectively, than when administered alone, and the terminal half-life was decreased by 32%, without any significant change in furosemide renal clearance. No information is available about the interaction of metformin and furosemide when co-administered chronically. </p>

<h3><span class="Bold">Nifedipine</span></h3>
<p class="First"> A single-dose, metformin-nifedipine drug interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that co-administration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount excreted in the urine. T<span class="Sub">max</span> half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Metformin had minimal effects on nifedipine. </p>

<h3><span class="Bold">Cationic Drugs</span></h3>
<p class="First">Cationic drugs (e.g., amiloride, digoxin, morphine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine, ranitidine, triamterene, trimethoprim, and vancomycin) that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion theoretically have the potential for interaction with metformin by competing for common renal tubular transport systems. Such interaction between metformin and oral cimetidine has been observed in normal healthy volunteers in both single- and multiple-dose, metformin-cimetidine drug interaction studies, with a 60% increase in peak metformin plasma and whole blood concentrations and a 40% increase in plasma and whole blood metformin AUC. There was no change in elimination half-life in the single-dose study. Metformin had no effect on cimetidine pharmacokinetics. Although such interactions remain theoretical (except for cimetidine), careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of metformin and/or the interfering drug is recommended in patients who are taking cationic medications that are excreted via the proximal renal tubular secretory system.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold">Other</span></h3>
<p class="First">Certain drugs tend to produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span> and may lead to loss of glycemic control. These drugs include thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving metformin, the patient should be observed closely for loss of blood glucose control. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving metformin, the patient should be observed closely for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>.</p>
<p>In healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of metformin and propranolol and metformin and ibuprofen were not affected when co-administered in single-dose interaction studies.</p>
<p>Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins and is, therefore, less likely to interact with highly protein-bound drugs such as salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, and probenecid, as compared to the sulfonylureas, which are extensively bound to serum proteins.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Long-term carcinogenicity studies have been performed in rats (dosing duration of 104 weeks) and mice (dosing duration of 91 weeks) at doses up to and including 900 mg/kg/day and 1500 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are both approximately four times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2000 mg based on body surface area comparisons. No evidence of carcinogenicity with metformin was found in either male or female mice. Similarly, there was no tumorigenic potential observed with metformin in male rats. There was, however, an increased incidence of benign stromal uterine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4187628" conceptname="Polyp">polyps</span> in female rats treated with 900 mg/kg/day.</p>
<p>There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of metformin in the following <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> tests: Ames test (S. <span class="Italics">typhimurium</span>), gene mutation test (mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> cells), or chromosomal aberrations test (human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span>). Results in the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus test were also negative.</p>
<p>Fertility of male or female rats was unaffected by metformin when administered at doses as high as 600 mg/kg/day, which is approximately three times the maximum recommended human daily dose based on body surface area comparisons.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold">Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B.</span></h3>
<p class="First"> Recent information strongly suggests that abnormal blood glucose levels during pregnancy are associated with a higher incidence of congenital abnormalities. Most experts recommend that insulin be used during pregnancy to maintain blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, metformin should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly needed. </p>
<p> There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women with metformin. Metformin was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day. This represents an exposure of about two and six times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2000 mg based on body surface area comparisons for rats and rabbits, respectively. Determination of fetal concentrations demonstrated a partial placental barrier to metformin. </p>

<h1>Nursing Mothers</h1>
<p class="First"> Studies in lactating rats show that metformin is excreted into milk and reaches levels comparable to those in plasma. Similar studies have not been conducted in nursing mothers. Because the potential for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> in nursing infants may exist, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. If metformin is discontinued, and if diet alone is inadequate for controlling blood glucose, insulin therapy should be considered. </p>

<p class="First"> The safety and effectiveness of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP for treatment of type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> have been established in pediatric patients ages 10 to 16 years (studies have not been conducted in pediatric patients below the age of 10 years). Use of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP in this age group is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Metformin in adults with additional data from a controlled clinical study in pediatric patients ages 10-16 years with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, which demonstrated a similar response in glycemic control to that seen in adults. (See <a href="#i4i_section_ID_clinicalpharamacology_pcs">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pediatric Clinical Studies.</a>) In this study, adverse effects were similar to those described in adults.

<h1>Geriatric Use</h1>
<p class="First"> Controlled clinical studies of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients, although other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. Metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and because the risk of serious adverse reactions to the drug is greater in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>, it should only be used in patients with normal renal function (see <a href="#i4i_contraindications_ID_contraindications">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>, <a href="#warnings">WARNINGS,</a> and <a href="#i4i_section_ID_pharmacokinetics">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics</a>). Because aging is associated with reduced renal function, metformin should be used with caution as age increases. Care should be taken in dose selection and should be based on careful and regular monitoring of renal function. Generally, elderly patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of metformin (see also <a href="#warnings">WARNINGS</a> and <a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_ID_dosageadmin">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>). </p>

Dosage of metformin must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance, while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose. The maximum recommended daily dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP is 2550 mg in adults and 2000 mg in pediatric patients (10-16 years of age). </p>
<p> Metformin should be given in divided doses with meals and should be started at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation, both to reduce gastrointestinal side effects and to permit identification of the minimum dose required for adequate glycemic control of the patient. </p>
<p> During treatment initiation and dose titration (see <a href="#i4i_section_ID_rec_dos_sch">Recommended Dosing Schedule</a>), fasting plasma glucose should be used to determine the therapeutic response to metformin and identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4123836" conceptname="Glycosylated hemoglobin">glycosylated hemoglobin</span> should be measured at intervals of approximately three months. <span class="Bold">The therapeutic goal should be to decrease both fasting plasma glucose and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4123836" conceptname="Glycosylated hemoglobin">glycosylated hemoglobin</span> levels to normal or near normal by using the lowest effective dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP either when used as monotherapy or in combination with sulfonylureas or insulin.</span></p>
<p> Monitoring of blood glucose and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4123836" conceptname="Glycosylated hemoglobin">glycosylated hemoglobin</span> will also permit detection of primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication, and secondary failure, i.e., loss of an adequate blood glucose lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness. </p>

<h3><span class="Bold">Adults</span></h3>
<p class="First">In general, clinically significant responses are not seen at doses below 1500 mg per day. However, a lower recommended starting dose and gradually increased dosage is advised to minimize <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302537" conceptname="Digestive system finding">gastrointestinal symptoms</span>.</p>
<p> The usual starting dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP is 500 mg twice a day or 850 mg once a day, given with meals. Dosage increases should be made in increments of 500 mg weekly or 850 mg every 2 weeks, up to a total of 2000 mg per day, given in divided doses. Patients can also be titrated from 500 mg twice a day to 850 mg twice a day after 2 weeks. For those patients requiring additional glycemic control, metformin may be given to a maximum daily dose of 2550 mg per day. Doses above 2000 mg may be better tolerated given three times a day with meals. </p>

<h2>Transfer from Other Antidiabetic Therapy</h2>
<p class="First">When transferring patients from standard oral hypoglycemic agents other than chlorpropamide to metformin, no transition period generally is necessary. When transferring patients from chlorpropamide, care should be exercised during the first two weeks because of the prolonged retention of chlorpropamide in the body, leading to overlapping drug effects and possible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>.</p>

<h2>Concomitant Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets, USP and Oral Sulfonylurea Therapy in Adult Patients</h2>
<p class="First">If patients have not responded to four weeks of the maximum dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP monotherapy, consideration should be given to gradual addition of an oral sulfonylurea while continuing metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP at the maximum dose, even if prior primary or secondary failure to a sulfonylurea has occurred. Clinical and pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction data are currently available only for metformin plus glyburide (glibenclamide). With concomitant metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP and sulfonylurea therapy, the desired control of blood glucose may be obtained by adjusting the dose of each drug. In a clinical trial of patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> and prior failure on glyburide, patients started on metformin 500 mg and glyburide 20 mg were titrated to 1000/20 mg, 1500/20 mg, 2000/20 mg or 2500/20 mg of metformin and glyburide, respectively, to reach the goal of glycemic control as measured by FPG, HbA1c and plasma glucose response (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_clinical_studies_ID_clinicalstudies">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Studies</a></span>). However, attempts should be made to identify the minimum effective dose of each drug to achieve this goal. With concomitant metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP and sulfonylurea therapy, the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> associated with sulfonylurea therapy continues and may be increased. Appropriate precautions should be taken. (See Package Insert of the respective sulfonylurea.)</p>
<p>If patients have not satisfactorily responded to one to three months of concomitant therapy with the maximum dose of metformin and the maximum dose of an oral sulfonylurea, consider therapeutic alternatives including switching to insulin with or without metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP.</p>

<h2>Concomitant Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets, USP and Insulin Therapy in Adult Patients</h2>
<p class="First">The current insulin dose should be continued upon initiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP therapy. Metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP therapy should be initiated at 500 mg once daily in patients on insulin therapy. For patients not responding adequately, the dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP should be increased by 500 mg after approximately 1 week and by 500 mg every week thereafter until adequate glycemic control is achieved. The maximum recommended daily dose is 2500 mg for metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP. It is recommended that the insulin dose be decreased by 10% to 25% when fasting plasma glucose concentrations decrease to less than 120 mg/dL in patients receiving concomitant insulin and metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP. Further adjustment should be individualized based on glucose-lowering response.</p>

<h2>Specific Patient Populations</h2>
<p class="First">Metformin is not recommended for use in pregnancy.</p>
<p>Metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP are not recommended in patients below the age of 10 years.</p>
<p>The initial and maintenance dosing of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP should be conservative in patients with advanced age, due to the potential for decreased renal function in this population. Any dosage adjustment should be based on a careful assessment of renal function. Generally, elderly, debilitated, and malnourished patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP.</p>
<p>Monitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span>, particularly in the elderly. (See <a href="#warnings">WARNINGS.</a>)</p>

<h2> What is Metformin? </h2>
<p class="First">Metformin is used to treat type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>. This is also known as non-insulin-dependent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus. People with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> are not able to make enough insulin or respond normally to the insulin their bodies make. When this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. This can lead to serious medical problems including kidney damage, amputations, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377551" conceptname="Blind hypertensive eye">blindness</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">Diabetes</span> is also closely linked to heart disease. The main goal of treating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> is to lower your blood sugar to a normal level.</p>
<p>High blood sugar can be lowered by diet and exercise, by a number of medicines taken by mouth, and by insulin shots. Before you take metformin, try to control your <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> by exercise and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span>. While you take your <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> medicine, continue to exercise and follow the diet advised for your <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>. No matter what your recommended <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> management plan is, studies have shown that maintaining good blood sugar control can prevent or delay complications of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377551" conceptname="Blind hypertensive eye">blindness</span>.</p>
<p> Metformin helps control your blood sugar in a number of ways. These include helping your body respond better to the insulin it makes naturally, decreasing the amount of sugar your liver makes, and decreasing the amount of sugar your intestines absorb. Metformin does not cause your body to make more insulin. Because of this, when taken alone, they rarely cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> (low blood sugar), and usually do not cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span>. However, when they are taken with a sulfonylurea, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> is more likely to occur, as is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span>. </p>
