<p>Okay, you're ready. To become a non-smoker, start today. Now before you do anything else, you have a bit of planning to do. Read this User's Guide all the way through. You want to make sure you bought the right dose to start. If you typically smoke <span class="Bold">your first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up,</span> use the 4 mg mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. If you smoke <span class="Bold">your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up,</span> use the 2 mg mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">THE PROGRAM</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">STEP 1.</span><span class="Bold"> (Weeks 1-6) Starting on your quit date it's best to use at least 9 mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges each day, one every 1-2 hours.</span></p>
<p>First choose the day you plan to quit (make it soon). Place the Step 1 reminder on this date. That's the day you will start using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to calm your cravings for nicotine and help you stay smoke free. Prior to the quit date, get rid of all your cigarettes to remove temptations and make it more difficult to start smoking again.</p>
<p>Use a mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge every 1 to 2 hours and at least 9 lozenges each day for the first 6 weeks to help prevent unexpected cravings and improve your chances of quitting. <span class="Bold">These aren't ordinary lozenges.</span> Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve.  Minimize swallowing. <span class="Bold">Do not chew or swallow the lozenge.</span> You may feel a warm or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4193492" conceptname="Acroparesthesia">tingling sensation</span>.</p>
<p>Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other until completely dissolved. <span class="Bold">Remember to read the instructions on page 8 before you take your first mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge.</span> (Booklet Format Only)</p>

<p><span class="Bold">STEP 2.</span><span class="Bold"> (The next three weeks, that is weeks 7-9). </span><span class="Bold">At the beginning of week 7 start using fewer mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges, one every 2-4 hours.</span></p>
<p>After six weeks, you should wait a little longer between lozenges, one lozenge every two to four hours. This will help you gradually use fewer mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Put the Step 2 reminder on the first day of week 7 to help remind you when to start reducing the number of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">STEP 3.</span><span class="Bold"> (The last three weeks, that is weeks 10-12). At the beginning of week 10, reduce mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge use even further, one every 4-8 hours.</span></p>
<p>At the beginning of week 10 further decrease the number of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day to reduce the amount of nicotine you get. You should do this by using one lozenge every 4 to 8 hours. Put the Step 3 reminder on the first day of week 10 so you know when you should be starting this last step to becoming smoke- and nicotine-free.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">END. At the end of week 12 youâ€™ll complete mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges therapy.</span></p>
<p>Put the â€œEX-SMOKERâ€? reminder on your calendar on the date 12 weeks after the day you stopped smoking and started using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">BE PREPARED.</span></p>
<p>Since smoking is an addiction, it is hard to quit. Even after you stop, there will be times when you WANT a cigarette, sometimes strongly. (See also section on â€œChallenges To Watch Forâ€?). The best defense is to be prepared. Plan now for handling tough times so you don't give in. For example: think about situations when you usually get a craving for cigarettes or where you think you might experience strong cravings. Try to avoid these situations where you can (for example, avoid spending time with smokers, or drinking alcohol, if those things tempt you to smoke).</p>
<p>Change your habits. For example, take your coffee break somewhere else. Take a walk. In other words, break the association between your usual habits and cigarettes.</p>
<p>If you do encounter a situation where you feel a strong craving, fight it! Take a break from the situation; keep yourself busy or distracted with other activities. Remind yourself why you want to quit, and above all, remind yourself that having â€œjust oneâ€? really will hurt your goal of quitting!</p>
<p>To prepare for tough situations, assemble a â€œsurvival packageâ€? â€“ items that can keep you distracted in case you get a craving. For example, you may include cinnamon gum or hard candy, relaxing music, and things to keep your hands busy like a smooth stone, paper clips, or a rubber ball.</p>
<p>Track your progress as you quit. Keep a journal. Write down how many pieces of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day. Note if and when you get a craving. If you slip and have a cigarette, don't give up. Stop smoking again and get back on your program with mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges.</p>
<p>Establish your support network. Keep friends' and family members' phone numbers ready to get the moral support you need. Before quitting, ask friends and family to support and encourage you. Think of specific ways they can help. </p>
<p>Reward yourself. Set aside little gifts to yourself such as a CD or video, which you can earn by overcoming difficult hurdles.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">HOW mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES WORK.</span>  Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy. They deliver nicotine to your body, temporarily relieving craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms when you quit smoking. But unlike cigarettes, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges deliver a lower, steady level of nicotine to your blood. When used as directed, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help you regulate, control, and gradually reduce your body's craving for nicotine.</p>
<p>The good news is that mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges contain no tar or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4198996" conceptname="Carbon monoxide">carbon monoxide</span>, and therefore don't present the same medical risks as cigarettes.</p>
<p>However, the lozenges still deliver nicotine, the addictive ingredient in cigarettes. And for some people the nicotine in mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can occasionally cause mouth or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4038048" conceptname="Throat irritation">throat irritation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headaches</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194475" conceptname="Hiccoughs">hiccups</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012224" conceptname="Upset stomach">upset stomach</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">USING mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY.</span></p>
<p>Remember, <span class="Bold">mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges aren't like ordinary lozenges such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> drops. </span>This lozenge is designed to deliver nicotine into your system through the lining of your mouth, not in your stomach like most other medicines. It is important to minimize swallowing the dissolved medicine in these lozenges so that it can be properly absorbed in your mouth.</p>
<p>Do not use more than one lozenge at a time, or many lozenges one after another since this can cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194475" conceptname="Hiccoughs">hiccups</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="23325" conceptname="Heartburn">heartburn</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> or other side effects.</p>
<p>Read all the following instructions before using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Refer to them often to make sure you're using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">IMPORTANT: Don't <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">worry</span> or give up if you do not like the taste of the lozenge at first. Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a medication, not a candy. Most people get used to the taste after a day or two. Remember, staying with the plan will help you quit. Begin using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on your quit date.</span></p>

<p><span class="Bold">Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 hours. Do not use more than 20 lozenges per day.</span> At the end of 12 weeks (3 months) you will have completed treatment.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">FOR THE BEST CHANCE OF QUITTING,</span> use mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on a regular schedule, using at least 9 lozenges a day during the first 6 weeks. That will help your body better adjust to the lack of cigarettes and better help prevent cravings. Some people may need more lozenges to reduce their cravings. Do not exceed the recommended maximum daily dosage of 20 lozenges per day. Do not continuously use one lozenge after another, since this may cause you <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194475" conceptname="Hiccoughs">hiccups</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="23325" conceptname="Heartburn">heartburn</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> or other side effects.</p>
<p>Do not eat or drink 15 minutes before using or while the lozenge is in your mouth.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">CUTTING BACK ON YOUR mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGE USAGE.</span></p>
<p>The whole reason for using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges is to decrease and slowly eliminate your need for nicotine, while you control cravings. So, as the above schedule indicates, you should gradually reduce the amount of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take per day. Some people find it easier to reduce by substituting ordinary sweets or sugar free candy for some of the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges they would normally use. As time goes on, you can increase the number of pieces of candy as you further reduce your use of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. <span class="Bold">It is important to complete treatment.</span> If you still feel the need to use mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges after week 12, talk with your health care provider.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">MAKE QUITTING EASIER ON YOURSELF.</span></p>
<p>Soon after your quit date, parties, bars, celebrations, and socializing may all tempt you to smoke. Please remember these tips to help you resist those urges and stay smoke-free.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">The Day You Quit Smoking:</span></p>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd><dl>

<dd>Look to your family and friends for support. Let them know what to do or avoid doing to help you quit.</dd>
</dl></dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>Throw away ALL cigarettes, ashtrays, matches, lighters. You don't need them. You don't want them and you want to make it difficult to go back.</dd>
</dl></dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>Keep yourself occupied. Take a walk. See a movie. See friends. Do anything to keep your mind off cigarettes.</dd>
</dl></dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>Calculate all the money you'll save by not buying cigarettes. Probably well over $1,000 a year! $1,000 a year? Think of what you can spend it on!</dd>
</dl></dd>
<dt></dt>

<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>Know what situations are going to make you want to smoke. Plan now how you'll avoid them or deal with them so you don't smoke.</dd>
</dl></dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>Keep mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges next to your bed so you're prepared when you get up. A lot of people get cravings first thing in the morning.</dd>
</dl></dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>Make an appointment to see your dentist and get the tobacco stains cleaned off. While you're getting rid of the evidence of cigarettes in the house, do the same for your teeth. Have clothes or drapes that smell of smoking cleaned.</dd>
</dl></dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>Now that your house is smoke-free, try to spend most of your time in smoke-free environments.</dd>
</dl></dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>If you usually smoked with coffee or alcohol, try to keep away from them for now. Remember you are also trying to break a habit.</dd>

<p>REMEMBER: Urges to smoke are temporary. They'll pass, even if you don't smoke.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT.</span></p>
<p>As you are successful at staying smoke-free, initially you will probably notice a few of the following typical withdrawal symptoms, so don't be surprised. Use of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges reduces these symptoms, but may not eliminate them entirely. They will go away with time. Stay focused on your goal of becoming an ex-smoker. Research shows that if you manage to avoid all smoking in the first week (that means not having a single puff), your chances of success increase dramatically.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">The First Few Days.</span> You may feel nervous or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritable</span> or have difficulty concentrating during the first few days after you quit smoking. Your body needs time to regain balance. Initially, you might feel a little out of sorts, get <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headaches</span>, feel light-headed, or have trouble sleeping. Your smokerâ€™s <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> may get worse before it improves. But <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029621" conceptname="Fear">fear</span> not, itâ€™s a positive sign. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">Coughing</span> helps clean your lungs of the tar residue you got from smoking.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">After a Couple of Weeks.</span><span class="Bold"></span>Your confidence and ability to cope with urges to smoke should be getting stronger. But don't be over-confident and think you can smoke just one cigarette. Even now, having even a single puff can lead to a return to smoking cigarettes regularly. Be prepared, and remember why you wanted to stop smoking. </p>
<p>Have you noticed that your sense of taste and smell has improved? You are probably <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">coughing</span> less and finding it easier to breathe. You've also probably noticed your withdrawal symptoms are subsiding (though don't <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">worry</span> if they're still there: they last longer for some people). These are all positive signs that your body is getting used to your success at stopping smoking.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">By The End </span><span class="Bold">Of</span><span class="Bold"> The First Month.</span> You are less likely to have cravings for cigarettes as often. However sudden cravings may still happen, and when they do, be on your guard, as they can be strong and seem to come out of the blue. Be prepared for these challenging times. The key is do what you can so these unexpected cravings can't beat you. Keep focused on the ways non-smokers are more attractive than smokers. Their breath smells better. Their clothes and hair are fresher. Their teeth are cleaner and brighter. Their skin is less likely to wrinkle. Not smoking around children and your friends is also healthier for them too.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What If You Do Slip And Smoke?</span></p>
<p>â€œWhat if I relapse?â€? One cigarette is a slip-up, but it's not the end of the quit effort. Everybody slips at something. The key is this: forgive yourself and stop at that one cigarette. Don't let this slip ruin your good intentions, keep at your quit attempt. So, throw out your cigarettes and continue with your quit attempt, keeping in mind what went wrong and led to the slip.</p>
<p>If you do go back to smoking, certainly don't throw out your mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Keep them for the next time you're ready to quit. In fact research says that even if you are back to smoking regularly the best thing you can do is learn and try again.</p>
<p>Try to understand the reason you had those cigarettes that made you slip. Thatâ€™s important, because now you can plan better to deal with these moments next time. Itâ€™s true you stumbled, but donâ€™t think of yourself as having failed. Encourage yourself by treating the last attempt as a learning experience, even a â€œtrial runâ€? for the real thing.</p>
<p>Take a look at the usage instructions and check that you used the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly and for the full 12 weeks of the program. When you try again make sure you use enough and the right way. That way youâ€™ll be best equipped to deal with the unexpected cravings.</p>
<p>Donâ€™t forget; quitting isn't easy and it takes practice to do anything. Stopping smoking is no different.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">YOUâ€™VE MADE IT.</span></p>
<p>Once your twelve week quitting program is over, youâ€™ve taken your last mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. Now you are both cigarette and nicotine-free. Get up and give yourself a standing ovation. We mean it. Do you realize that you have just done a really difficult thing?</p>
<p>Nowâ€™s a good time to think back on the process. Think of all your reasons for quitting smoking. Think of your goals. Think of how theyâ€™re going to be a reality now.</p>
<p>Think of what youâ€™re going to do with your newly liberated cigarette money. The places you can now go smoke-free.  Think of the extra time you may have added to your life and what you can do with it. And although you may still experience the occasional temptation, and cigarettes still want you back, think positively. Think forward. And consider yourself a proud non-smoker.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">2. Are</span><span class="Bold"> mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges just swapping one type of nicotine addiction for another?</span></p>
<p>Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do contain nicotine, however there is probably less nicotine in your daily dose of lozenges than in your cigarettes. Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges give you enough nicotine to help you combat the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can cope with the mental side of stopping smoking. Also, since the nicotine from the lozenges goes into your bloodstream more slowly, it produces less of the effects of nicotine that people find rewarding. In fact, when used as directed in the 12 week program, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges gradually wean you off your <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> for both nicotine and cigarettes. </p>

<p><span class="Bold">4. Will I put on weight?</span></p>
<p>In the first couple of months after quitting smoking, some people do put on a few pounds. But think of it this way. Overall, youâ€™ll be healthier and look better. You can always tackle your weight by changing your diet and increasing the amount you exercise once you have gotten through the difficult part of stopping smoking.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">5. Does taking mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges cost more than smoking?</span></p>
<p>If you normally smoke a pack and a half a day, your total cost of using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges during the 12-week period should be less than smoking. But guess what? After youâ€™ve finished the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge program all that money you used to spend on cigarettes is now savings. And think of the health issues youâ€™ll hopefully be able to avoid.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">6. What if I have a cigarette and start smoking?</span></p>
<p>Don't panic. First, don't think badly of yourself. Throw away your cigarettes and forgive yourself. Then think about what went wrong and get back on track. In fact people who have already tried to stop smoking are more likely to be successful the next time.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">CHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR.</span></p>
<p>Once you quit smoking, you are likely to experience periodic, and sometimes intense, temptations to smoke. Certain situations present special challenges. Some common ones include:</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Stress and upset.</span></p>
<p>When you are feeling stressed or upset, you may think a cigarette will make everything better. It wonâ€™t. Find other ways to relax and unwind.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">The blues.</span></p>
<p>You may be especially vulnerable when you feel bored or blue. Remember that having a cigarette will just make you feel worse.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Smoking cues.</span></p>
<p>Seeing cigarettes or watching other people smoke can trigger temptation. Remember that you choose not to smoke anymore.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Alcohol.</span></p>
<p>Drinking and smoking seem to go together, and alcoholic beverages may weaken your resolve, making drinking dangerous to your quit effort. Avoid drinking early in your quit effort, and try to drink with non-smokers.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Automatic slips.</span></p>
<p>Sometimes you may find yourself preparing to smoke without even realizing it. Watch out for those moments when your hand seems to â€˜automaticallyâ€™ reach for a cigarette. </p>
<p>Watch out for these situations: they can trigger a relapse. You probably know which one(s) are most dangerous for you; plan ahead to deal with the situation effectively. Always remember that youâ€™re trying to break a habit, and the most important thing is to do something to combat the urge in these situations.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">COPING AFTER QUITTING.</span></p>
<p>The key to staying smoke-free is to prepare for and cope with challenges as they occur. If you find yourself tempted to smoke, do something! Here are some things to consider.</p>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>Escape. Leave the situation, even for a few minutes. Most temptations donâ€™t last long.</dd>
</dl></dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>Distract yourself. Get your mind off smoking. Think of something else or get busy with something.</dd>
</dl></dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>Relax. Don't let stress get to you. Think of pleasant, relaxing things; breathe slowly and regularly.  Let the stress drain out of you.</dd>
</dl></dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>Talk yourself out of it. What you say to yourself matters. So, remind yourself how important it is for you to quit; remind yourself you can't have just one; or just command yourself to STOP.</dd>
