<p>Mild to moderate sedation occurs within 2-4 minutes. Following induction, lateral recumbency occurs within 4 minutes, followed by complete anesthesia within 6-16 minutes. During recovery from anesthesia, sternal recumbency occurs within 12-83 minutes, followed by standing in 17-84 minutes.

<h1><span class="Bold">Warnings </span></h1>
<p class="First">Not for human use. Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children. </p>
<p>Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. </p>
<p>Although apparently deeply sedated, some horses may still respond to external stimuli with defensive movements (for example, kicking). Sedated horses are frequently ataxic. Routine safety measures should be used to protect practitioners and handlers. </p>
<p>Romifidine hydrochloride can be absorbed and may cause irritation following direct exposure to skin, eyes or mouth. In case of accidental eye exposure, flush with water for 15 minutes. In case of accidental skin exposure, wash with soap and water. Remove contaminated clothing. In case of accidental oral exposure or injection, seek medical attention. If irritation or other adverse reaction occurs (for example, sedation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>), seek medical attention. </p>
<p>As with all injectable drugs causing profound physiological effects, precautions should be taken by practitioners to prevent accidental self-injection when handling and using filled syringes. Users receiving treatment for blood pressure abnormalities should take special precaution to avoid exposure to this product. </p>

<p class="First">The use of Sedivet 1.0% Injection with other Î±<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonists is not recommended since the effects (for example, cardiovascular changes, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437584" conceptname="Ataxia">ataxia</span>) could be additive. </p>
<p>The adverse effects of Sedivet 1.0% Injection may be potentiated by the administration of other sedatives, tranquilizers, or opioids. </p>
<p>The use of epinephrine should be avoided since epinephrine may potentiate the effects of Î±<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonists. </p>

<p class="First">Romifidine is a potent Î±<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenoceptor agonist that produces sedation and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>.

<h1><span class="Bold">Effectiveness </span></h1>
<p class="First">A field study was conducted to evaluate romifidine as a sedative or a preanesthetic. Clinicians selected an appropriate dose, based on the procedure. Sedative doses ranged between 30-100 Î¼g/kg; preanesthetic doses ranged between 40-100 Î¼g/kg. The quality of sedation was rated as â€œgoodâ€? or â€œexcellentâ€? in 18 of 23 horses. Of the remaining five horses evaluated for sedation, three were rated as â€œfairâ€? and two were rated as â€œpoorâ€?. When used for preanesthesia, inductions were rated as â€œwell-controlledâ€? in 16 of 23 horses. Recoveries from anesthesia were evaluated as â€œsatisfactoryâ€? or â€œexcellentâ€? in 20 of 23 horses. Two horses required more than three attempts to stand. One horse was euthanized without recovery, due to an unfavorable diagnosis unrelated to drug administration. </p>
<p>In a sedation dose confirmation study with a crossover design, twenty horses were used to evaluate romifidine at two doses: 40 and 120 Î¼g/kg. Clinical assessments of depth of sedation, behavioral attitude, stance/posture, head <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373194" conceptname="Paralytic ptosis">ptosis</span>, ear <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373194" conceptname="Paralytic ptosis">ptosis</span>, eyelid and lip drooping were evaluated. Depth and duration of sedation were affected in a dose dependent manner. By the response of the horses to thermal noxious stimuli applied to withers and fetlock, the degree and duration of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> were also shown to be dose dependent. Transient physiological and clinical effects included decreased respiratory and heart rates, second degree <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316135" conceptname="Atrioventricular block">atrioventricular block</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4207204" conceptname="Excessive salivation">increased salivation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="253321" conceptname="Stridor">stridor</span>, penile relaxation, and a slight decrease in body temperature. Seventy-five minutes after receiving the 40 Î¼g/kg dose, one older horse with a preexistent grade IV/VI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316822" conceptname="Heart murmur">systolic murmur</span>, experienced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">ventricular tachycardia</span> that lasted for 11.5 minutes. Another horse was diagnosed with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255848" conceptname="Pneumonia">pneumonia</span> three days after receiving the 120 Î¼g/kg dose of romifidine. </p>
<p>In a separate preanesthesia crossover study, the effectiveness of the 100 Î¼g/kg preanesthetic romifidine dose was confirmed. Ten horses were induced with either ketamine or thiopental, followed by isoflurane maintenance anesthesia. The quality of induction, the transition to inhalant anesthesia, and the quality of anesthesia were scored as â€œexcellentâ€? for all horses. All horses except one stood on the first attempt (one stood on the third attempt). </p>
