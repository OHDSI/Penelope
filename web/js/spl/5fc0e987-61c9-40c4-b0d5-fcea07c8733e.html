<h1><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION</span></h1>
<p class="First">Lorazepam, a benzodiazepine with antianxiety, sedative, and anticonvulsant effects, is intended for the intramuscular or intravenous routes of administration. It has the chemical formula: 7-chloro-5(2-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-3-hydroxy-2<span class="Italics">H</span>-1, 4-benzodiazepin-2-one. The molecular weight is 321.16, and the C.A.S. No. is [846-49-1]. The structural formula is:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="Ativan structural formula" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=5fc0e987-61c9-40c4-b0d5-fcea07c8733e&amp;name=ativan-injection-1.jpg"></div>
<p>Lorazepam is a nearly white powder almost insoluble in water. Each mL of sterile injection contains either 2.0 or 4.0 mg of lorazepam, 0.18 mL polyethylene glycol 400 in propylene glycol with 2.0% benzyl alcohol as preservative.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span></h1>
<p class="First">Lorazepam interacts with the Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-benzodiazepine receptor complex, which is widespread in the brain of humans as well as other species. This interaction is presumed to be responsible for lorazepamâ€™s mechanism of action. Lorazepam exhibits relatively high and specific affinity for its recognition site but does not displace GABA. Attachment to the specific binding site enhances the affinity of GABA for its receptor site on the same receptor complex. The pharmacodynamic consequences of benzodiazepine agonist actions include antianxiety effects, sedation, and reduction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> activity. The intensity of action is directly related to the degree of benzodiazepine receptor occupancy.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Effects in Pre-Operative Patients</span></h2>
<p class="First">Intravenous or intramuscular administration of the recommended dose of 2 mg to 4 mg of ATIVAN Injection to adult patients is followed by dose-related effects of sedation (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>), relief of preoperative <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, and lack of recall of events related to the day of surgery in the majority of patients. The clinical sedation (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>) thus noted is such that the majority of patients are able to respond to simple instructions whether they give the appearance of being awake or asleep. The lack of recall is relative rather than absolute, as determined under conditions of careful patient questioning and testing, using props designed to enhance recall. The majority of patients under these reinforced conditions had difficulty recalling perioperative events or recognizing props from before surgery. The lack of recall and recognition was optimum within 2 hours following intramuscular administration and 15 to 20 minutes after intravenous injection.</p>
<p>The intended effects of the recommended adult dose of ATIVAN Injection usually last 6 to 8 hours. In rare instances, and where patients received greater than the recommended dose, excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> and prolonged lack of recall were noted. As with other benzodiazepines, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4046907" conceptname="Dysequilibrium syndrome">unsteadiness</span>, enhanced sensitivity to CNS-depressant effects of ethyl alcohol and other drugs were noted in isolated and rare cases for greater than 24 hours.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Physiologic Effects in Healthy Adults</span></h2>
<p class="First">Studies in healthy adult volunteers reveal that intravenous lorazepam in doses up to 3.5 mg/70 kg does not alter sensitivity to the respiratory stimulating effect of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135927" conceptname="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</span> and does not enhance the respiratory-depressant effects of doses of meperidine up to 100 mg/70 kg (also determined by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135927" conceptname="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</span> challenge) as long as patients remain sufficiently awake to undergo testing. Upper airway obstruction has been observed in rare instances where the patient received greater than the recommended dose and was excessively <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepy</span> and difficult to arouse (seeÂ <a href="#LINK_b8c9eb56-fcf1-41f8-ba9e-cd6654e481c4">WARNINGS</a>Â and <a href="#LINK_95b43db5-34ff-4dc7-9815-976fea0f62bb">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a>).</p>
<p>Clinically employed doses of ATIVAN Injection do not greatly affect the circulatory system in the supine position or employing a 70-degree tilt test. Doses of 8 mg to 10 mg of intravenous lorazepam (2 to 2-1/2 times the maximum recommended dosage) will produce loss of lid reflexes within 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Studies in 6 healthy young adults who received lorazepam injection and no other drugs revealed that visual tracking (the ability to keep a moving line centered) was impaired for a mean of 8 hours following administration of 4 mg of intramuscular lorazepam and 4 hours following administration of 2 mg intramuscularly with considerable subject variation. Similar findings were noted with pentobarbital, 150 and 75 mg. Although this study showed that both lorazepam and pentobarbital interfered with eye-hand coordination, the data are insufficient to predict when it would be safe to operate a motor vehicle or engage in a hazardous occupation or sport.</p>

<h4>Intramuscular</h4>
<p class="First">Following intramuscular administration, lorazepam is completely and rapidly absorbed reaching peak concentrations within 3 hours. A 4-mg dose provides a C<span class="Sub">max</span> of approximately 48 ng/mL. Following administration of 1.5 to 5.0 mg of lorazepam IM, the amount of lorazepam delivered to the circulation is proportional to the dose administered.</p>

<h3>DISTRIBUTION/METABOLISM/ELIMINATION</h3>
<p class="First">At clinically relevant concentrations, lorazepam is 91Â±2% bound to plasma proteins; its volume of distribution is approximately 1.3 L/kg. Unbound lorazepam penetrates the blood/brain barrier freely by passive diffusion, a fact confirmed by CSF sampling. Following parenteral administration, the terminal half-life and total clearance averaged 14Â±5 hours and 1.1Â±0.4 mL/min/kg, respectively.</p>
<p>Lorazepam is extensively conjugated to the 3-O-phenolic glucuronide in the liver and is known to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Lorazepam glucuronide is an inactive metabolite and is eliminated mainly by the kidneys.</p>
<p>Following a single 2-mg oral dose of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-lorazepam to 8 healthy subjects, 88Â±4% of the administered dose was recovered in urine and 7Â±2% was recovered in feces. The percent of administered dose recovered in urine as lorazepam glucuronide was 74Â±4%. Only 0.3% of the dose was recovered as unchanged lorazepam, and the remainder of the radioactivity represented minor metabolites.</p>

<h3>PATIENTS WITH <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">RENAL INSUFFICIENCY</span></h3>
<p class="First">Because the kidney is the primary route of elimination of lorazepam glucuronide, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> would be expected to compromise its clearance. This should have no direct effect on the glucuronidation (and inactivation) of lorazepam. There is a possibility that the enterohepatic circulation of lorazepam glucuronide leads to a reduced efficiency of the net clearance of lorazepam in this population.</p>
<p>Six normal subjects, six patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (Cl<span class="Sub">cr</span> of 22Â±9 mL/min), and four patients on chronic maintenance hemodialysis were given single 1.5 to 3.0 mg intravenous doses of lorazepam. Mean volume of distribution and terminal half-life values of lorazepam were 40% and 25% higher, respectively, in renally impaired patients than in normal subjects. Both parameters were 75% higher in patients undergoing hemodialysis than in normal subjects. Overall, though, in this group of subjects the mean total clearance of lorazepam did not change. About 8% of the administered intravenous dose was removed as intact lorazepam during the 6-hour dialysis session.</p>
<p>The kinetics of lorazepam glucuronide were markedly affected by renal dysfunction. The mean terminal half-life was prolonged by 55% and 125% in renally impaired patients and patients under hemodialysis, respectively, as compared to normal subjects. The mean metabolic clearance decreased by 75% and 90% in renally impaired patients and patients under hemodialysis, respectively, as compared with normal subjects. About 40% of the administered lorazepam intravenous dose was removed as glucuronide conjugate during the 6-hour dialysis session.</p>

<h3><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">HEPATIC DISEASE</span></h3>
<p class="First">Because cytochrome oxidation is not involved with the metabolism of lorazepam, liver disease would not be expected to have an effect on metabolic clearance. This prediction is supported by the observation that following a single 2 mg intravenous dose of lorazepam, cirrhotic male patients (n=13) and normal male subjects (n=11) exhibited no substantive difference in their ability to clear lorazepam.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Clinical Studies</span></h2>
<p class="First">The effectiveness of ATIVAN Injection in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span> was established in two multi-center controlled trials in 177 patients. With rare exceptions, patients were between 18 and 65 years of age. More than half the patients in each study had tonic-clonic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span>; patients with simple partial and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4043559" conceptname="Complex partial status epilepticus">complex partial status epilepticus</span> comprised the rest of the population studied, along with a smaller number of patients who had absence status.</p>
<p>One study (n=58) was a double-blind active-control trial comparing ATIVAN Injection and diazepam. Patients were randomized to receive ATIVAN 2 mg IV (with an additional 2 mg IV if needed) or diazepam 5 mg IV (with an additional 5 mg IV if needed). The primary outcome measure was a comparison of the proportion of responders in each treatment group, where a responder was defined as a patient whose <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> stopped within 10 minutes after treatment and who continued <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span>-free for at least an additional 30 minutes. Twenty-four of the 30 (80%) patients were deemed responders to ATIVAN and 16/28 (57%) patients were deemed responders to diazepam (p=0.04). Of the 24 ATIVAN responders, 23 received both 2 mg infusions.</p>
<p>Non-responders to ATIVAN 4 mg were given an additional 2 to 4 mg ATIVAN; non-responders to diazepam 10 mg were given an additional 5 to 10 mg diazepam. After this additional dose administration, 28/30 (93%) of patients randomized to ATIVAN and 24/28 (86%) of patients randomized to diazepam were deemed responders, a difference that was not statistically significant.</p>
<p>Although this study provides support for the efficacy of ATIVAN as the treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span>, it cannot speak reliably or meaningfully to the comparative performance of either diazepam (Valium) or lorazepam (ATIVAN Injection) under the conditions of actual use.</p>
<p>A second study (n=119) was a double-blind dose-comparison trial with 3 doses of ATIVAN Injection: 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg. Patients were randomized to receive one of the three doses of ATIVAN. The primary outcome and definition of responder were as in the first study. Twenty-five of 41 patients (61%) responded to 1 mg ATIVAN; 21/37 patients (57%) responded to 2 mg ATIVAN; and 31/41 (76%) responded to 4 mg ATIVAN. The p-value for a statistical test of the difference between the ATIVAN 4 mg dose group and the ATIVAN 1-mg dose group was 0.08 (two-sided). Data from all randomized patients were used in this test.</p>
<p>Although analyses failed to detect an effect of age, sex, or race on the effectiveness of ATIVAN in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span>, the numbers of patients evaluated were too few to allow a definitive conclusion about the role these factors may play.</p>

<h3>MANAGEMENT OF <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">STATUS EPILEPTICUS</span></h3>
<p class="First"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">Status epilepticus</span> is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with a high risk of permanent neurological impairment, if inadequately treated. The treatment of status, however, requires far more than the administration of an anticonvulsant agent. It involves observation and management of all parameters critical to maintaining vital function and the capacity to provide support of those functions as required. Ventilatory support must be readily available. The use of benzodiazepines, like ATIVAN Injection, is ordinarily only one step of a complex and sustained intervention which may require additional interventions (e.g., concomitant intravenous administration of phenytoin). Because <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span> may result from a correctable acute cause such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">hyponatremia</span>, or other metabolic or toxic derangement, such an abnormality must be immediately sought and corrected. Furthermore, patients who are susceptible to further <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> episodes should receive adequate maintenance antiepileptic therapy.</p>
<p>Any health care professional who intends to treat a patient with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span> should be familiar with this package insert and the pertinent medical literature concerning current concepts for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span>. A comprehensive review of the considerations critical to the informed and prudent management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span> cannot be provided in drug product labeling. The archival medical literature contains many informative references on the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span>, among them the report of the working group on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span> of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">Epilepsy</span> Foundation of America â€œTreatment of Convulsive Status Epilepticusâ€? (JAMA 1993; 270:854-859). As noted in the report just cited, it may be useful to consult with a neurologist if a patient fails to respond (e.g., fails to regain consciousness).</p>
<p>For the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span>, the usual recommended dose of ATIVAN Injection is 4 mg given slowly (2 mg/min) for patients 18 years and older. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> cease, no additional ATIVAN Injection is required. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> continue or recur after a 10- to 15- minute observation period, an additional 4 mg intravenous dose may be slowly administered. <span class="Italics">Experience with further doses of ATIVAN is very limited.</span> The usual precautions in treating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span> should be employed. An intravenous infusion should be started, vital signs should be monitored, an unobstructed airway should be maintained, and artificial ventilation equipment should be available.</p>

<h3><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION</span></h3>
<p class="First">The most important risk associated with the use of ATIVAN Injection in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span> is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>. Accordingly, airway patency must be assured and respiration monitored closely. Ventilatory support should be given as required.</p>

<h3>EXCESSIVE SEDATION</h3>
<p class="First">Because of its prolonged duration of action, the prescriber should be alert to the possibility, especially when multiple doses have been given, that the sedative effects of lorazepam may add to the impairment of consciousness seen in the post-ictal state.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Preanesthetic Use</span></h2>
<p class="First">AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION MAY OCCUR IN HEAVILY SEDATED PATIENTS. INTRAVENOUS LORAZEPAM AT ANY DOSE, WHEN GIVEN EITHER ALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER DRUGS ADMINISTERED DURING ANESTHESIA, MAY PRODUCE HEAVY SEDATION; THEREFORE, EQUIPMENT NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN A PATENT AIRWAY AND TO SUPPORT RESPIRATION/VENTILATION SHOULD BE AVAILABLE.</p>
<p>As is true of similar CNS-acting drugs, the decision as to when patients who have received injectable lorazepam, particularly on an outpatient basis, may again operate machinery, drive a motor vehicle, or engage in hazardous or other activities requiring attention and coordination must be individualized. It is recommended that no patient engage in such activities for a period of 24 to 48 hours or until the effects of the drug, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, have subsided, whichever is longer. Impairment of performance may persist for greater intervals because of extremes of age, concomitant use of other drugs, stress of surgery, or the general condition of the patient.</p>
<p>Clinical trials have shown that patients over the age of 50 years may have a more profound and prolonged sedation with intravenous lorazepam (see also <a href="#LINK_5358e397-4bf4-4e3f-97fb-c574924a5d6f">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Preanesthetic</a>).</p>
<p>As with all central-nervous-system-depressant drugs, care should be exercised in patients given injectable lorazepam as premature ambulation may result in injury from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falling</span>.</p>
<p>There is no added beneficial effect from the addition of scopolamine to injectable lorazepam, and their combined effect may result in an increased incidence of sedation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucination</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4131797" conceptname="Disturbance in thinking">irrational</span> behavior.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">General (All Uses)</span></h2>
<p class="First">PRIOR TO INTRAVENOUS USE, ATIVAN INJECTION MUST BE DILUTED WITH AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF COMPATIBLE DILUENT (see <a href="#LINK_6a4d4f0a-e869-4d95-8a18-595652426c26">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>). INTRAVENOUS INJECTION SHOULD BE MADE SLOWLY AND WITH REPEATED <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">ASPIRATION</span>. CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN TO DETERMINE THAT ANY INJECTION WILL NOT BE INTRA-ARTERIAL AND THAT PERIVASCULAR <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4295895" conceptname="Extravasation">EXTRAVASATION</span> WILL NOT TAKE PLACE. IN THE EVENT THAT A PATIENT COMPLAINS OF <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">PAIN</span> DURING INTENDED INTRAVENOUS INJECTION OF ATIVAN INJECTION, THE INJECTION SHOULD BE STOPPED IMMEDIATELY TO DETERMINE IF INTRA-ARTERIAL INJECTION OR PERIVASCULAR <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4295895" conceptname="Extravasation">EXTRAVASATION</span> HAS TAKEN PLACE.</p>
<p>Since the liver is the most likely site of conjugation of lorazepam and since excretion of conjugated lorazepam (glucuronide) is a renal function, this drug is not recommended for use in patients with hepatic and/or renal <span class="Italics">failure</span>. ATIVAN should be used with caution in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span> (see <a href="#LINK_6a4d4f0a-e869-4d95-8a18-595652426c26">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Pregnancy</span></h2>
<p class="First">ATIVAN MAY CAUSE FETAL DAMAGE WHEN ADMINISTERED TO PREGNANT WOMEN. Ordinarily, ATIVAN Injection should not be used during pregnancy except in serious or life-threatening conditions where safer drugs cannot be used or are ineffective. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">Status epilepticus</span> may represent such a serious and life-threatening condition.</p>
<p>An increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of minor tranquilizers (chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and meprobamate) during the first trimester of pregnancy has been suggested in several studies. In humans, blood levels obtained from umbilical cord blood indicate placental transfer of lorazepam and lorazepam glucuronide.</p>
<p>Reproductive studies in animals were performed in mice, rats, and two <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of rabbits. Occasional anomalies (reduction of tarsals, tibia, metatarsals, malrotated limbs, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218764" conceptname="Gastroschisis">gastroschisis</span>, malformed skull, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="376512" conceptname="Microphthalmos">microphthalmia</span>) were seen in drug-treated rabbits without relationship to dosage. Although all of these anomalies were not present in the concurrent control group, they have been reported to occur randomly in historical controls. At doses of 40 mg/kg orally or 4 mg/kg intravenously and higher, there was evidence of fetal resorption and increased fetal loss in rabbits which was not seen at lower doses.</p>
<p>The possibility that a woman of childbearing potential may be pregnant at the time of therapy should be considered.</p>
<p>There are insufficient data regarding obstetrical safety of parenteral lorazepam, including use in cesarean section. Such use, therefore, is not recommended.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Endoscopic Procedures</span></h2>
<p class="First">There are insufficient data to support the use of ATIVAN Injection for outpatient endoscopic procedures. Inpatient endoscopic procedures require adequate recovery room observation time.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">General</span></h2>
<p class="First">The additive central-nervous-system effects of other drugs, such as phenothiazines, narcotic analgesics, barbiturates, antidepressants, scopolamine, and monoamine-oxidase inhibitors, should be borne in mind when these other drugs are used concomitantly with or during the period of recovery from ATIVAN Injection (see <a href="#LINK_099218f8-e174-4563-8aab-7ea257eec559">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a> and <a href="#LINK_b8c9eb56-fcf1-41f8-ba9e-cd6654e481c4">WARNINGS</a>).</p>
<p>Extreme caution must be used when administering ATIVAN Injection to elderly patients, very ill patients, or to patients with limited pulmonary reserve because of the possibility that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312603" conceptname="Hypoventilation">hypoventilation</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxic</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span> may occur. Resuscitative equipment for ventilatory support should be readily available (see <a href="#LINK_b8c9eb56-fcf1-41f8-ba9e-cd6654e481c4">WARNINGS</a> and <a href="#LINK_6a4d4f0a-e869-4d95-8a18-595652426c26">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>
<p>When lorazepam injection is used IV as the premedicant prior to regional or local anesthesia, the possibility of excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> may interfere with patient cooperation in determining levels of anesthesia. This is most likely to occur when greater than 0.05 mg/kg is given and when narcotic analgesics are used concomitantly with the recommended dose (see <a href="#LINK_95b43db5-34ff-4dc7-9815-976fea0f62bb">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a>).</p>
<p>As with all benzodiazepines, paradoxical reactions may occur in rare instances and in an unpredictable fashion (see <a href="#LINK_95b43db5-34ff-4dc7-9815-976fea0f62bb">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a>). In these instances, further use of the drug in these patients should be considered with caution.</p>
<p>There have been reports of possible propylene glycol toxicity (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span>, hyperosmolality, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>) and possible polyethylene glycol toxicity (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="444044" conceptname="Acute tubular necrosis">acute tubular necrosis</span>) during administration of ATIVAN Injection at higher than recommended doses.

<h2><span class="Bold">Information for Patients</span></h2>
<p class="First">Patients should be informed of the pharmacological effects of the drug, including sedation, relief of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, and lack of recall, the duration of these effects (about 8 hours), and be apprised of the risks as well as the benefits of therapy.</p>
<p>Patients who receive ATIVAN Injection as a premedicant should be cautioned that driving a motor vehicle, operating machinery, or engaging in hazardous or other activities requiring attention and coordination, should be delayed for 24 to 48 hours following the injection or until the effects of the drug, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, have subsided, whichever is longer. Sedatives, tranquilizers and narcotic analgesics may produce a more prolonged and profound effect when administered along with injectable ATIVAN. This effect may take the form of excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> and, on rare occasions, interfere with recall and recognition of events of the day of surgery and the day after.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised that getting out of bed unassisted may result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falling</span> and injury if undertaken within 8 hours of receiving lorazepam injection. Since tolerance for CNS depressants will be diminished in the presence of ATIVAN Injection, these substances should either be avoided or taken in reduced dosage. Alcoholic beverages should not be consumed for at least 24 to 48 hours after receiving lorazepam injectable due to the additive effects on central-nervous-system <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> seen with benzodiazepines in general. Elderly patients should be told that ATIVAN Injection may make them very <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepy</span> for a period longer than 6 to 8 hours following surgery.</p>

<p>The risk of using lorazepam in combination with scopolamine, loxapine, clozapine, haloperidol, or other CNS-depressant drugs has not been systematically evaluated. Therefore, caution is advised if the concomitant administration of lorazepam and these drugs is required.</p>
<p>Concurrent administration of any of the following drugs with lorazepam had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam: metoprolol, cimetidine, ranitidine, disulfiram, propranolol, metronidazole, and propoxyphene. No change in ATIVAN dosage is necessary when concomitantly given with any of these drugs.</p>

<h3>LORAZEPAM-VALPROATE INTERACTION</h3>
<p class="First">Concurrent administration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with valproate (250 mg twice daily orally for 3 days) to 6 healthy male subjects resulted in decreased total clearance of lorazepam by 40% and decreased formation rate of lorazepam glucuronide by 55%, as compared with lorazepam administered alone. Accordingly, lorazepam plasma concentrations were about two-fold higher for at least 12 hours post-dose administration during valproate treatment. Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to 50% of the normal adult dose when this drug combination is prescribed in patients (see also <a href="#LINK_6a4d4f0a-e869-4d95-8a18-595652426c26">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>

<h3>LORAZEPAM-ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE STEROIDS INTERACTION</h3>
<p class="First">Coadministration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with oral contraceptive steroids (norethindrone acetate, 1 mg, and ethinyl estradiol, 50 Î¼g, for at least 6 months) to healthy females (n=7) was associated with a 55% decrease in half-life, a 50% increase in the volume of distribution, thereby resulting in an almost 3.7-fold increase in total clearance of lorazepam as compared with control healthy females (n=8). It may be necessary to increase the dose of ATIVAN in female patients who are concomitantly taking oral contraceptives (see also <a href="#LINK_6a4d4f0a-e869-4d95-8a18-595652426c26">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>

<p class="First">Concurrent administration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with probenecid (500 mg orally every 6 hours) to 9 healthy volunteers resulted in a prolongation of lorazepam half-life by 130% and a decrease in its total clearance by 45%. No change in volume of distribution was noted during probenecid co-treatment. ATIVAN dosage needs to be reduced by 50% when coadministered with probenecid (see also <a href="#LINK_6a4d4f0a-e869-4d95-8a18-595652426c26">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>

<p class="First">The safety of ATIVAN in pediatric patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span> has not been systematically evaluated. Open-label studies described in the medical literature included 273 pediatric/adolescent patients; the age range was from a few hours old to 18 years of age. Paradoxical excitation was observed in 10% to 30% of the pediatric patients under 8 years of age and was characterized by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremors</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142453" conceptname="Feeling high">euphoria</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4294887" conceptname="Cluttering">logorrhea</span>, and brief episodes of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275889" conceptname="Visual hallucinations">visual hallucinations</span>.

Nevertheless, the development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> after treatment with benzodiazepines is probably rare, based on the incidence in the uncontrolled treatment series reported (i.e., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> were not observed for 112 pediatric patients and 18 adults or during approximately 400 doses).</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Geriatric Use</span></h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of ATIVAN generally were not adequate to determine whether subjects aged 65 and over respond differently than younger subjects; however, age over 65 may be associated with a greater incidence of central nervous system <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and more <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> (see <a href="#LINK_6348baf1-ab53-49fa-8199-e13567b3a53f">WARNINGSâ€“Preanesthetic Use</a>Â ,Â <a href="#LINK_b1ab4e78-bdde-45df-be21-b7fb5f6c968f">PRECAUTIONSâ€“General</a>Â and <a href="#LINK_bb759cf4-452c-44bc-86a7-b2c7b61452bd">ADVERSE REACTIONSâ€“Preanesthetic</a>).</p>

<h3>INCIDENCE IN CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS</h3>
<p class="First">All adverse events were recorded during the trials by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Similar types of events were grouped into standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the table and listings below with the frequencies representing the proportion of individuals exposed to ATIVAN Injection or to comparative therapy.</p>
<p>The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigators involving different treatment, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied.</p>

<p class="First">ATIVAN Injection, active comparators, and ATIVAN Injection in combination with a comparator were administered to 488 individuals during controlled and open-label clinical trials. Because of reenrollments, these 488 patients participated in a total of 521 patient-episodes. ATIVAN Injection alone was given in 69% of these patient-episodes (n=360). The safety information below is based on data available from 326 of these patient-episodes in which ATIVAN Injection was given alone.</p>
<p>All adverse events that were seen once are listed, except those already included in previous listings (Table 1 and Table 2).</p>
<p>Study events were classified by body system in descending frequency by using the following definitions: frequent adverse events were those that occurred in at least 1/100 individuals; infrequent study events were those that occurred in 1/100 to 1/1000 individuals.</p>

<h3>CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM</h3>
<p class="First">The most frequent adverse drug event reported with injectable lorazepam is central-nervous-system <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>. The incidence varied from one study to another, depending on the dosage, route of administration, use of other central-nervous-system depressants, and the investigatorâ€™s opinion concerning the degree and duration of desired sedation. Excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> were the most common consequences of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span>. This interfered with patient cooperation in approximately 6% (25/446) of patients undergoing regional anesthesia, causing difficulty in assessing levels of anesthesia. Patients over 50 years of age had a higher incidence of excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> when compared with those under 50 (21/106 versus 24/245) when lorazepam was given intravenously (see <a href="#LINK_6a4d4f0a-e869-4d95-8a18-595652426c26">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>). On rare occasion (3/1580) the patient was unable to give personal identification in the operating room on arrival, and one patient fell when attempting premature ambulation in the postoperative period.</p>
<p>Symptoms such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">restlessness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4136768" conceptname="Crying">crying</span>, sobbing, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373995" conceptname="Delirium">delirium</span> occurred in about 1.3% (20/1580). One patient injured himself by picking at his incision during the immediate postoperative period.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">Hallucinations</span> were present in about 1% (14/1580) of patients and were visual and self-limiting.</p>
<p>An occasional patient complained of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373474" conceptname="Diplopia">diplopia</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079185" conceptname="Hazy vision">blurred vision</span>. Depressed hearing was infrequently reported during the peak-effect period.</p>
<p>An occasional patient had a prolonged recovery room stay, either because of excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> or because of some form of inappropriate behavior. The latter was seen most commonly when scopolamine was given concomitantly as a premedicant. Limited information derived from patients who were discharged the day after receiving injectable lorazepam showed one patient complained of some <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4046907" conceptname="Dysequilibrium syndrome">unsteadiness</span> of gait and a reduced ability to perform complex mental functions. Enhanced sensitivity to alcoholic beverages has been reported more than 24 hours after receiving injectable lorazepam, similar to experience with other benzodiazepines.</p>

<h3>LOCAL EFFECTS</h3>
<p class="First">Intramuscular injection of lorazepam has resulted in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> at the injection site, a sensation of burning, or observed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">redness</span> in the same area in a very variable incidence from one study to another. The overall incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> and burning in patients was about 17% (146/859) in the immediate postinjection period and about 1.4% (12/859) at the 24-hour observation time. Reactions at the injection site (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">redness</span>) occurred in approximately 2% (17/859) in the immediate postinjection period and were present 24 hours later in about 0.8% (7/859).</p>
<p>Intravenous administration of lorazepam resulted in painful responses in 13/771 patients or approximately 1.6% in the immediate postinjection period, and 24 hours later 4/771 patients or about 0.5% still complained of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">Redness</span> did not occur immediately following intravenous injection but was noted in 19/771 patients at the 24-hour observation period. This incidence is similar to that observed with an intravenous infusion before lorazepam is given. Intra-arterial injection may produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4292397" conceptname="Arteriospasm">arteriospasm</span> resulting in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439928" conceptname="Gangrenous disorder">gangrene</span> which may require amputation (see <a href="#LINK_ebd2dd95-d63f-4170-9051-d3bb61beb03e">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>).</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Treatment</span></h2>
<p class="First">Treatment of overdosage is mainly supportive until the drug is eliminated from the body. Vital signs and fluid balance should be carefully monitored in conjunction with close observation of the patient. An adequate airway should be maintained and assisted respiration used as needed. With normally functioning kidneys, forced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span> with intravenous fluids and electrolytes may accelerate elimination of benzodiazepines from the body. In addition, osmotic diuretics, such as mannitol, may be effective as adjunctive measures. In more critical situations, renal dialysis and exchange blood transfusions may be indicated. Lorazepam does not appear to be removed in significant quantities by dialysis, although lorazepam glucuronide may be highly dialyzable. The value of dialysis has not been adequately determined for lorazepam.</p>

<h3>GENERAL ADVICE</h3>
<p class="First"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">Status epilepticus</span> is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with a high risk of permanent neurological impairment, if inadequately treated. The treatment of status, however, requires far more than the administration of an anticonvulsant agent. It involves observation and management of all parameters critical to maintaining vital function and the capacity to provide support of those functions as required. Ventilatory support must be readily available. The use of benzodiazepines, like ATIVAN Injection, is ordinarily only an initial step of a complex and sustained intervention which may require additional interventions, (e.g., concomitant intravenous administration of phenytoin). Because <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span> may result from a correctable acute cause such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">hyponatremia</span>, or other metabolic or toxic derangement, such an abnormality must be immediately sought and corrected. Furthermore, patients who are susceptible to further <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> episodes should receive adequate maintenance antiepileptic therapy.</p>
<p>Any health care professional who intends to treat a patient with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span> should be familiar with this package insert and the pertinent medical literature concerning current concepts for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span>. A comprehensive review of the considerations critical to the informed and prudent management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span> cannot be provided in drug product labeling. The archival medical literature contains many informative references on the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span>, among them the report of the working group on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span> of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">Epilepsy</span> Foundation of America â€œTreatment of Convulsive Status Epilepticusâ€? (JAMA 1993; 270:854-859). As noted in the report just cited, it may be useful to consult with a neurologist if a patient fails to respond (e.g., fails to regain consciousness).</p>

<h3>INTRAVENOUS INJECTION</h3>
<p class="First">For the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span>, the usual recommended dose of ATIVAN Injection is 4 mg given slowly (2 mg/min) for patients 18 years and older. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> cease, no additional ATIVAN Injection is required. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> continue or recur after a 10- to 15-minute observation period, an additional 4 mg intravenous dose may be slowly administered. <span class="Italics">Experience with further doses of ATIVAN is very limited.</span> The usual precautions in treating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span> should be employed. An intravenous infusion should be started, vital signs should be monitored, an unobstructed airway should be maintained, and artificial ventilation equipment should be available.</p>

<h3>INTRAMUSCULAR INJECTION</h3>
<p class="First">IM ATIVAN is not preferred in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span> because therapeutic lorazepam levels may not be reached as quickly as with IV administration. However, when an intravenous port is not available, the IM route may prove useful (see <a href="#LINK_552b5136-21f4-46d0-b550-8c9f7be08095">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</a>).</p>

<h3>INTRAMUSCULAR INJECTION</h3>
<p class="First">For the designated indications as a premedicant, the usual recommended dose of lorazepam for intramuscular injection is 0.05 mg/kg up to a maximum of 4 mg. As with all premedicant drugs, the dose should be individualized (see also <a href="#LINK_099218f8-e174-4563-8aab-7ea257eec559">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>, <a href="#LINK_b8c9eb56-fcf1-41f8-ba9e-cd6654e481c4">WARNINGS</a>, <a href="#LINK_4272851c-73b0-46a5-ba0a-04b105eb638b">PRECAUTIONS</a>, and <a href="#LINK_95b43db5-34ff-4dc7-9815-976fea0f62bb">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a>). Doses of other central-nervous-system-depressant drugs ordinarily should be reduced (see <a href="#LINK_4272851c-73b0-46a5-ba0a-04b105eb638b">PRECAUTIONS</a>). <span class="Italics">For optimum effect, measured as lack of recall, intramuscular lorazepam should be administered at least 2 hours before the anticipated operative procedure.</span> Narcotic analgesics should be administered at their usual preoperative time.</p>
<p>There are insufficient data to support efficacy or make dosage recommendations for intramuscular lorazepam in patients less than 18 years of age; therefore, such use is not recommended.</p>

<h3>INTRAVENOUS INJECTION</h3>
<p class="First">For the primary purpose of sedation and relief of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, the usual recommended initial dose of lorazepam for intravenous injection is 2 mg total, or 0.02 mg/lb (0.044 mg/kg), whichever is smaller. This dose will suffice for sedating most adult patients and ordinarily should not be exceeded in patients over 50 years of age. In those patients in whom a greater likelihood of lack of recall for perioperative events would be beneficial, larger doses as high as 0.05 mg/kg up to a total of 4 mg may be administered (see <a href="#LINK_099218f8-e174-4563-8aab-7ea257eec559">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>, <a href="#LINK_b8c9eb56-fcf1-41f8-ba9e-cd6654e481c4">WARNINGS</a>, <a href="#LINK_4272851c-73b0-46a5-ba0a-04b105eb638b">PRECAUTIONS</a>, and <a href="#LINK_95b43db5-34ff-4dc7-9815-976fea0f62bb">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a>).

<h2><span class="Bold">Administration</span></h2>
<p class="First">When given intramuscularly, ATIVAN Injection, undiluted, should be injected deep in the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4152202" conceptname="Form of muscle">muscle mass</span>.</p>
<p>Injectable ATIVAN can be used with atropine sulfate, narcotic analgesics, other parenterally used analgesics, commonly used anesthetics, and muscle relaxants.</p>
<p>Immediately prior to intravenous use, ATIVAN Injection must be diluted with an equal volume of compatible solution. Contents should be mixed thoroughly by gently inverting the container repeatedly until a homogenous solution results. Do not shake vigorously, as this will result in air entrapment. When properly diluted, the drug may be injected directly into a vein or into the tubing of an existing intravenous infusion. The rate of injection should not exceed 2.0 mg per minute.</p>
<p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if solution is discolored or contains a precipitate.</p>
<p>ATIVAN Injection is compatible for dilution purposes with the following solutions: Sterile Water for Injection, USP; Sodium Chloride Injection, USP; 5% Dextrose Injection, USP.</p>
