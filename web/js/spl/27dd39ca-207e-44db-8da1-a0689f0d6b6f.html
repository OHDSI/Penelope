<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolic acid reductase. Dihydrofolates must be reduced to tetrahydro-folates by this enzyme before they can be utilized as carriers of one-carbon groups in the synthesis of purine nucleotides and thymidylate. Therefore, methotrexate interferes with DNA synthesis, repair, and cellular replication. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells, bone marrow, fetal cells, buccal and intestinal mucosa, and cells of the urinary bladder are in general more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. When cellular proliferation in malignant tissues is greater than in most normal tissues, methotrexate may impair malignant growth without irreversible damage to normal tissues.</p>
<p>The mechanism of action in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> is unknown; it may affect immune function. Two reports describe <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> methotrexate inhibition of DNA precursor uptake by stimulated mono-nuclear cells, and another describes in animal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4025831" conceptname="Arthritis mutilans">polyarthritis</span> partial correction by methotrexate of spleen cell hyporesponsiveness and suppressed IL 2 production. Other laboratories, however, have been unable to demonstrate similar effects. Clarification of methotrexateâ€™s effect on immune activity and its relation to rheumatoid immunopathogenesis await further studies.</p>
<p>In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span>, effects of methotrexate on articular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4082445" conceptname="Tenderness">tenderness</span> can be seen as early as 3 to 6 weeks. Although methotrexate clearly ameliorates symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4060220" conceptname="Stiff neck">stiffness</span>), there is no evidence that it induces remission of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> nor has a beneficial effect been demonstrated on bone erosions and other radiologic changes which result in impaired joint use, functional <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052648" conceptname="Disability">disability</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168498" conceptname="Deformity">deformity</span>.</p>
<p>Most studies of methotrexate in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> are relatively short term (3 to 6 months). Limited data from long-term studies indicate that an initial clinical improvement is maintained for at least two years with continued therapy.</p>
<p>In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span>, the rate of production of epithelial cells in the skin is greatly increased over normal skin. This differential in proliferation rates is the basis for the use of methotrexate to control the psoriatic process.</p>
<p>In a 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 127 pediatric patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4253901" conceptname="Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis">juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</span> (JRA) (mean age, 10.1 years; age range 2.5 to 18 years, mean duration of disease, 5.1 years) on background non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or prednisone, methotrexate given weekly at an oral dose of 10 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> provided significant clinical improvement compared to placebo as measured by either the physicianâ€™s global assessment, or by a patient composite (25% reduction in the articular-severity score plus improvement in parent and physician global assessments of disease activity.) Over two-thirds of the patients in this trial had polyarticular-course JRA, and the numerically greatest response was seen in this subgroup treated with 10 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/wk methotrexate. The overwhelming majority of the remaining patients had systemic-course JRA. All patients were unresponsive to NSAIDs; approximately one-third were using low dose corticosteroids. Weekly methotrexate at a dose of 5 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> was not significantly more effective than placebo in this trial.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Absorption</span> - In adults, oral absorption appears to be dose dependent. Peak serum levels are reached within one to two hours. At doses of 30 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> or less, methotrexate is generally well absorbed with a mean bioavailability of about 60%. The absorption of doses greater than 80 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>Â  is significantly less, possibly due to a saturation effect.</p>
<p>In leukemic pediatric patients, oral absorption of methotrexate also appears to be dose dependent and has been reported to vary widely (23% to 95%). A twenty fold difference between highest and lowest peak levels (C<span class="Sub">max</span>: 0.11 to 2.3 micromolar after a 20Â mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> dose) has been reported. Significant interindividual variability has also been noted in time to peak concentration (T<span class="Sub">max</span>: 0.67 to 4 hrs after a 15 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> dose) and fraction of dose absorbed. The absorption of doses greater than 40 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> has been reported to be significantly less than that of lower doses. Food has been shown to delay absorption and reduce peak concentration. Methotrexate is generally completely absorbed from parenteral routes of injection. After intramuscular injection, peak serum concentrations occur in 30 to 60 minutes. As in leukemic pediatric patients, a wide inter-individual variability in the plasma concentrations of methotrexate has been reported in pediatric patients with JRA. Following oral administration of methotrexate in doses of 6.4 to 11.2 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/week in pediatric patients with JRA, mean serum concentrations were 0.59 micromolar (range, 0.03 to 1.40) at 1 hour, 0.44 micromolar (range, 0.01 to 1.00) at 2 hours, and 0.29 micromolar (range 0.06 to 0.58) at 3 hours. In pediatric patients receiving methotrexate for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134305" conceptname="Acute lymphoid leukemia">acute lymphocytic leukemia</span> (6.3 to 30 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>), or for JRA (3.75 to 26.2 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>), the terminal half-life has been reported to range from 0.7 to 5.8 hours or 0.9 to 2.3 hours, respectively.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Distribution</span> - After intravenous administration, the initial volume of distribution is approximately 0.18 L/kg (18% of body weight) and steady-state volume of distribution is approximately 0.4 to 0.8Â L/kg (40% to 80% of body weight). Methotrexate competes with reduced folates for active transport across cell membranes by means of a single carrier-mediated active transport process. At serum concentrations greater than 100 micromolar, passive diffusion becomes a major pathway by which effective intracellular concentrations can be achieved. Methotrexate in serum is approximately 50% protein bound. Laboratory studies demonstrate that it may be displaced from plasma albumin by various compounds including sulfonamides, salicylates, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, and phenytoin.</p>
<p>Methotrexate does not penetrate the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier in therapeutic amounts when given orally or parenterally. High CSF concentrations of the drug may be attained by intrathecal administration.</p>
<p>In dogs, synovial fluid concentrations after oral dosing were higher in inflamed than uninflamed joints. Although salicylates did not interfere with this penetration, prior prednisone treatment reduced penetration into inflamed joints to the level of normal joints.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span> - After absorption, methotrexate undergoes hepatic and intracellular metabolism to polyglutamated forms which can be converted back to methotrexate by hydrolase enzymes. These polyglutamates act as inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthetase. Small amounts of methotrexate polyglutamates may remain in tissues for extended periods. The retention and prolonged drug action of these active metabolites vary among different cells, tissues and tumors. A small amount of metabolism to 7-hydroxymethotrexate may occur at doses commonly prescribed. Accumulation of this metabolite may become significant at the high doses used in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4070783" conceptname="Osteosarcoma">osteogenic sarcoma</span>. The aqueous solubility of 7-hydroxymethotrexate is 3 to 5 fold lower than the parent compound. Methotrexate is partially metabolized by intestinal flora after oral administration.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Half-Life</span> - The terminal half-life reported for methotrexate is approximately three to ten hours for patients receiving treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> or low dose antineoplastic therapy (less than 30 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). For patients receiving high doses of methotrexate, the terminal half-life is eight to 15 hours.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span> - Renal excretion is the primary route of elimination and is dependent upon dosage and route of administration. With IV administration, 80% to 90% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine within 24 hours. There is limited biliary excretion amounting to 10% or less of the administered dose. Enterohepatic recirculation of methotrexate has been proposed.</p>
<p>Renal excretion occurs by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. Nonlinear elimination due to saturation of renal tubular reabsorption has been observed in psoriatic patients at doses between 7.5 and 30 mg. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Impaired renal function</span>, as well as concurrent use of drugs such as weak organic acids that also undergo tubular secretion, can markedly increase methotrexate serum levels. Excellent correlation has been reported between methotrexate clearance and endogenous creatinine clearance.</p>
<p>Methotrexate clearance rates vary widely and are generally decreased at higher doses. Delayed drug clearance has been identified as one of the major factors responsible for methotrexate toxicity. It has been postulated that the toxicity of methotrexate for normal tissues is more dependent upon the duration of exposure to the drug rather than the peak level achieved. When a patient has delayed drug elimination due to compromised renal function, a third space <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4215818" conceptname="Effusion">effusion</span>, or other causes, methotrexate serum concentrations may remain elevated for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4088438" conceptname="Prolonged periods">prolonged periods</span>.</p>
<p>The potential for toxicity from high dose regimens or delayed excretion is reduced by the administration of leucovorin calcium during the final phase of methotrexate plasma elimination. </p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic monitoring of methotrexate serum concentrations may help identify those patients at high risk for methotrexate toxicity and aid in proper adjustment of leucovorin dosing. Guidelines for monitoring serum methotrexate levels, and for adjustment of leucovorin dosing to reduce the risk of methotrexate toxicity, are provided below in <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_c93997ea-a17a-484e-a01e-259feea15e2e">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>.</p>
<p>Methotrexate has been detected in human breast milk. The highest breast milk to plasma concentration ratio reached was 0.08:1.</p>

<p class="First">Methotrexate can cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079844" conceptname="Fetal death">fetal death</span> or teratogenic effects when administered to a pregnant woman. Methotrexate is contraindicated in pregnant women with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> and should be used in the treatment of neoplastic diseases only when the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should not be started on methotrexate until pregnancy is excluded and should be fully counseled on the serious risk to the fetus (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_precautions_id_c1cd8598-c81c-46a0-be84-6f0d0b4f3c78">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>) should they become pregnant while undergoing treatment. Pregnancy should be avoided if either partner is receiving methotrexate; during and for a minimum of three months after therapy for male patients, and during and for at least one ovulatory cycle after therapy for female patients. (See Boxed <span class="Bold"><a href="#id_51409c73-86ef-4cb7-b4f6-0e9621e5894a">WARNINGS</a></span>.)</p>
<p>Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from methotrexate in breast fed infants, it is contraindicated in nursing mothers.</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Methotrexate has the potential for serious toxicity. (See Boxed <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_warnings_id_de9f0a0d-160c-480e-8f26-9312b53a1e90">WARNINGS</a></span>.) Toxic effects may be related in frequency and severity to dose or frequency of administration but have been seen at all doses. Because they can occur at any time during therapy, it is necessary to follow patients on methotrexate closely. Most adverse reactions are reversible if detected early. When such reactions do occur, the drug should be reduced in dosage or discontinued and appropriate corrective measures should be taken. If necessary, this could include the use of leucovorin calcium and/or acute, intermittent hemodialysis with a high-flux dialyzer. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_overdosage_id_739d14d3-1f14-47c5-9420-7c78ab0d9d77">OVERDOSAGE</a></span>.) If methotrexate therapy is reinstituted, it should be carried out with caution, with adequate consideration of further need for the drug and with increased alertness as to possible recurrence of toxicity.</p>
<p>The clinical pharmacology of methotrexate has not been well studied in older individuals. Due to diminished hepatic and renal function as well as decreased folate stores in this population, relatively low doses should be considered, and these patients should be closely monitored for early signs of toxicity.</p>

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Patients should be informed of the early signs and symptoms of toxicity, of the need to see their physician promptly if they occur, and the need for close follow-up, including periodic laboratory tests to monitor toxicity.</p>
<p>Both the physician and pharmacist should emphasize to the patient that the recommended dose is taken weekly in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span>, and that mistaken daily use of the recommended dose has led to fatal toxicity. Patients should be encouraged to read the Patient Instructions sheet within the Dose Pack. Prescriptions should not be written or refilled on a PRN basis.</p>
<p>Patients should be informed of the potential benefit and risk in the use of methotrexate. The risk of effects on reproduction should be discussed with both male and female patients taking methotrexate.</p>

<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">Patients undergoing methotrexate therapy should be closely monitored so that toxic effects are detected promptly. Baseline assessment should include a complete blood count with differential and platelet counts, hepatic enzymes, renal function tests, and a chest X-ray. During therapy of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span>, monitoring of these parameters is recommended: hematology at least monthly, renal function and liver function every 1 to 2 months. More frequent monitoring is usually indicated during antineoplastic therapy. <span class="Italics">During initial or changing doses</span>, or during periods of increased risk of elevated methotrexate blood levels (eg, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435796" conceptname="Dehydration">dehydration</span>), more frequent monitoring may also be indicated.</p>
<p>Transient liver function test abnormalities are observed frequently after methotrexate administration and are usually not cause for modification of methotrexate therapy. Persistent liver function test abnormalities, and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> of serum albumin may be indicators of serious liver toxicity and require evaluation. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_precautions_id_c1cd8598-c81c-46a0-be84-6f0d0b4f3c78">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>, <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_section_id_439c67c2-6e93-45ab-a312-bc45bd0e58f5">Organ System Toxicity</a></span>, <span class="Italics">Hepatic</span>.) </p>

Persistent abnormalities in liver function tests may precede appearance of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012171" conceptname="Fibrosis">fibrosis</span> or cirrhosis in the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> population.</p>
<p>Pulmonary function tests may be useful if methotrexate-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="257907" conceptname="Disorder of lung">lung disease</span> is suspected, especially if baseline measurements are available.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Concomitant administration of some NSAIDs with high dose methotrexate therapy has been reported to elevate and prolong serum methotrexate levels, resulting in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> from severe hematologic and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197596" conceptname="Toxic gastroenteritis">gastrointestinal toxicity</span>.</p>
<p>Caution should be used when NSAIDs and salicylates are administered concomitantly with lower doses of methotrexate. These drugs have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of methotrexate in an animal model and may enhance its toxicity.</p>
<p>Despite the potential interactions, studies of methotrexate in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> have usually included concurrent use of constant dosage regimens of NSAIDs, without apparent problems. It should be appreciated, however, that the doses used in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> (7.5 to 20Â mg/week) are somewhat lower than those used in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span> and that larger doses could lead to unexpected toxicity.</p>
<p>Methotrexate is partially bound to serum albumin, and toxicity may be increased because of displacement by certain drugs, such as salicylates, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, and sulfonamides. Renal tubular transport is also diminished by probenecid; use of methotrexate with this drug should be carefully monitored.</p>
<p>Oral antibiotics such as tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and nonabsorbable broad spectrum anti-biotics, may decrease intestinal absorption of methotrexate or interfere with the enterohepatic circulation by inhibiting bowel flora and suppressing metabolism of the drug by bacteria.</p>
<p>Penicillins may reduce the renal clearance of methotrexate; increased serum concentrations of methotrexate with concomitant hematologic and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197596" conceptname="Toxic gastroenteritis">gastrointestinal toxicity</span> have been observed with methotrexate. Use of methotrexate with penicillins should be carefully monitored.</p>
<p>The potential for increased hepatotoxicity when methotrexate is administered with other hepatotoxic agents has not been evaluated. However, hepatotoxicity has been reported in such cases. Therefore, patients receiving concomitant therapy with methotrexate and other potential hepatotoxins (eg, azathioprine, retinoids, sulfa-salazine) should be closely monitored for possible increased risk of hepatotoxicity.</p>
<p>Methotrexate may decrease the clearance of theophylline; theophylline levels should be monitored when used concurrently with methotrexate.</p>
<p>Certain side effects such as mouth sores may be reduced by folate supplementation with methotrexate.</p>
<p>Trimethoprim/sulfa-methoxazole has been reported rarely to increase bone marrow suppression in patients receiving methotrexate, probably by an additive antifolate effect.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">No controlled human data exist regarding the risk of neoplasia with methotrexate. Methotrexate has been evaluated in a number of animal studies for carcinogenic potential with inconclusive results. Although there is evidence that methotrexate causes chromosomal damage to animal somatic cells and human bone marrow cells, the clinical significance remains uncertain. Non-Hodgkinâ€™s <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> and other tumors have been reported in patients receiving low-dose oral methotrexate. However, there have been instances of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">malignant lymphoma</span> arising during treatment with low-dose oral methotrexate, which have regressed completely following withdrawal of methotrexate, without requiring active anti-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> treatment. Benefits should be weighed against the potential risks before using methotrexate alone or in combination with other drugs, especially in pediatric patients or young adults. Methotrexate causes embryotoxicity, abortion, and fetal defects in humans. It has also been reported to cause impairment of fertility, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4339289" conceptname="Oligozoospermia">oligospermia</span> and menstrual dysfunction in humans, during and for a short period after cessation of therapy.</p>

<p>Published clinical studies evaluating the use of methotrexate in children and adolescents (ie, patients 2 to 16 years of age) with JRA demonstrated safety comparable to that observed in adults with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span>.

<h2>Geriatric use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of methotrexate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic and renal function, decreased folate stores, concomitant disease or other drug therapy (ie, that interfere with renal function, methotrexate or folate metabolism) in this population (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_precautions_id_c1cd8598-c81c-46a0-be84-6f0d0b4f3c78">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>, <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_drug_interaction_id_1b364513-a234-40e7-8926-05663f16ccab">Drug Interactions</a></span>). Since decline in renal function may be associated with increases in adverse events and serum creatinine measurements may over estimate renal function in the elderly, more accurate methods (ie, creatine clearance) should be considered. Serum methotrexate levels may also be helpful. Elderly patients should be closely monitored for early signs of hepatic, bone marrow and renal toxicity. In chronic use situations, certain toxicities may be reduced by folate supplementation. Post-marketing experience suggests that the occurence of bone marrow suppression, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="253506" conceptname="Pneumonitis">pneumonitis</span> may increase with age.

<p><span class="Italics">Hepatic</span>: Methotrexate has the potential for acute (elevated transaminases) and chronic (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012171" conceptname="Fibrosis">fibrosis</span> and cirrhosis) hepatotoxicity. Chronic toxicity is potentially fatal; it generally has occurred after prolonged use (generally two years or more) and after a total dose of at least 1.5 grams. In studies in psoriatic patients, hepatotoxicity appeared to be a function of total cumulative dose and appeared to be enhanced by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218106" conceptname="Alcoholism">alcoholism</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433736" conceptname="Obesity">obesity</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> and advanced age.

Special caution is indicated in the presence of preexisting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver damage</span> or impaired hepatic function.</p>
<p>In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span>, liver function tests, including serum albumin, should be performed periodically prior to dosing but are often normal in the face of developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012171" conceptname="Fibrosis">fibrosis</span> or cirrhosis. These lesions may be detectable only by biopsy. The usual recommendation is to obtain a liver biopsy at 1) pretherapy or shortly after initiation of therapy (2 - 4 months), 2) a total cumulative dose of 1.5 grams, and 3) after each additional 1.0 to 1.5 grams. Moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012171" conceptname="Fibrosis">fibrosis</span> or any cirrhosis normally leads to discontinuation of the drug; mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012171" conceptname="Fibrosis">fibrosis</span> normally suggests a repeat biopsy in 6 months. Milder histologic findings such as fatty change and low grade portal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> are relatively common pretherapy.

<p class="First">There are no recent placebo-controlled trials in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span>. There are two literature reports (Roenigk, 1969 and Nyfors, 1978) describing large series (n=204, 248) of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span> patients treated with methotrexate.

<h2>Adverse Reactions in JRA Studies </h2>
<p class="First">The approximate incidences of adverse reactions reported in pediatric patients with JRA treated with oral, weekly doses of methotrexate (5 to 20 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/wk or 0.1 to 0.65 mg/kg/wk) were as follows (virtually all patients were receiving concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and some also were taking low doses of cortico-steroids): elevated liver function tests, 14%; gastrointestinal reactions (eg, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>), 11%; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138455" conceptname="Stomatitis">stomatitis</span>, 2%; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435224" conceptname="Leukopenia">leukopenia</span>, 2%; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, 1.2%; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133280" conceptname="Alopecia">alopecia</span>, 0.5%; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, 0.2%; and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>, 0.2%. Although there is experience with dosing up to 30 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/wk in JRA, the published data for doses above 20 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/wk are too limited to provide reliable estimates of adverse reaction rates.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Leucovorin is indicated to diminish the toxicity and counteract the effect of inadvertently administered overdosages of methotrexate. Leucovorin administration should begin as promptly as possible. As the time interval between methotrexate administration and leucovorin initiation increases, the effectiveness of leucovorin in counteracting toxicity decreases. Monitoring of the serum methotrexate concentration is essential in determining the optimal dose and duration of treatment with leucovorin.</p>
<p>In cases of massive overdosage, hydration and urinary alkalinization may be necessary to prevent the precipitation of methotrexate and/or its metabolites in the renal tubules. Generally speaking, neither hemodialysis nor peritoneal dialysis have been shown to improve methotrexate elimination. However, effective clearance of methotrexate has been reported with acute, intermittent hemodialysis using a high-flux dialyzer (Wall, SM et al: <span class="Italics">Am J Kidney</span> Dis 28(6): 846-854, 1996).</p>
<p>In postmarketing experience, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> with methotrexate has generally occurred with oral and intrathecal administration, although intravenous and intramuscular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> have also been reported.</p>
<p>Reports of oral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> often indicate accidental daily administration instead of weekly (single or divided doses). Symptoms commonly reported following oral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> include those symptoms and signs reported at pharmacologic doses, particularly hematologic and gastrointestinal reaction.

<h2>Neoplastic Diseases</h2>
<p class="First">Oral administration in tablet form is often preferred when low doses are being administered since absorption is rapid and effective serum levels are obtained.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4092517" conceptname="Choriocarcinoma">Choriocarcinoma</span> and similar trophoblastic diseases</span>: Methotrexate is administered orally or intramuscularly in doses of 15 to 30 mg daily for a five-day course. Such courses are usually repeated for 3 to 5 times as required, with rest periods of one or more weeks interposed between courses, until any manifesting toxic symptoms subside. The effectiveness of therapy is ordinarily evaluated by 24 hour quantitative analysis of urinary chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which should return to normal or less than 50 IU/24 hr usually after the third or fourth course and usually be followed by a complete resolution of measurable lesions in 4 to 6 weeks. One to two courses of methotrexate after normalization of hCG is usually recommended. Before each course of the drug careful clinical assessment is essential. Cyclic combination therapy of methotrexate with other antitumor drugs has been reported as being useful.</p>
<p>Since hydatidiform mole may precede <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4092517" conceptname="Choriocarcinoma">choriocarcinoma</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118659" conceptname="Prophylactic">prophylactic</span> chemotherapy with methotrexate has been recommended.</p>
<p>Chorioadenoma destruens is considered to be an invasive form of hydatidiform mole. Methotrexate is administered in these disease states in doses similar to those recommended for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4092517" conceptname="Choriocarcinoma">choriocarcinoma</span>. <br><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315497" conceptname="Subacute leukemia">Leukemia</span></span>: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134305" conceptname="Acute lymphoid leukemia">Acute lymphoblastic leukemia</span> in pediatric patients and young adolescents is the most responsive to present day chemotherapy. In young adults and older patients, clinical remission is more difficult to obtain and early relapse is more common.</p>
<p>Methotrexate alone or in combination with steroids was used initially for induction of remission in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134305" conceptname="Acute lymphoid leukemia">acute lymphoblastic leukemias</span>. More recently corticosteroid therapy, in combination with other antileukemic drugs or in cyclic combinations with methotrexate included, has appeared to produce rapid and effective remissions. When used for induction, methotrexate in doses of 3.3 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> in combination with 60 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> of prednisone, given daily, produced remissions in 50% of patients treated, usually within a period of 4 to 6 weeks. Methotrexate in combination with other agents appears to be the drug of choice for securing maintenance of drug-induced remissions. When remission is achieved and supportive care has produced general clinical improvement, maintenance therapy is initiated, as follows: Methotrexate is administered 2 times weekly either by mouth or intramuscularly in total weekly doses of 30 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>. It has also been given in doses of 2.5Â mg/kg intravenously every 14 days. If and when relapse does occur, reinduction of remission can again usually be obtained by repeating the initial induction regimen.</p>
<p>A variety of combination chemotherapy regimens have been used for both induction and maintenance therapy in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134305" conceptname="Acute lymphoid leukemia">acute lymphoblastic leukemia</span>. The physician should be familiar with the new advances in antileukemic therapy.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">Lymphomas</span></span>: In Burkittâ€™s tumor, Stages I-II, methotrexate has produced prolonged remissions in some cases. Recommended dosage is 10 to 25Â mg/day orally for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other anti-tumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage III may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily.</p>

Dosage in early stages is usuallly 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or cessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy.</p>

<p>For either adult RA or polyarticular-course JRA dosages may be adjusted gradually to achieve an optimal response. Limited experience shows a significant increase in the incidence and severity of serious toxic reactions, especially bone marrow suppression, at doses greater than 20 mg/wk in adults. Although there is experience with doses up to 30 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/wk in children, there are too few published data to assess how doses over 20 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/wk might affect the risk of serious toxicity in children. Experience does suggest, however, that children receiving 20 to 30 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/wk (0.65 to 1.0 mg/kg/wk) may have better absorption and fewer gastrointestinal side effects if methotrexate is administered either intramuscularly or subcutaneously.</p>
<p>Therapeutic response usually begins within 3 to 6 weeks and the patient may continue to improve for another 12 weeks or more.</p>
<p>The optimal duration of therapy is unknown. Limited data available from long-term studies in adults indicate that the initial clinical improvement is maintained for at least two years with continued therapy. When methotrexate is discontinued, the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4291025" conceptname="Arthritis">arthritis</span> usually worsens within 3 to 6 weeks.</p>
