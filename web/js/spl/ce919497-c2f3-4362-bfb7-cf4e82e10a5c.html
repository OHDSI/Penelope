<p>EVALUATION OF POSTMARKETING EXPERIENCE SUGGESTS THAT <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4026032" conceptname="Acute hepatic failure">ACUTE LIVER FAILURE</span> IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF FELBAMATE. THE REPORTED RATE IN THE U.S. HAS BEEN ABOUT 6 CASES OF <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">LIVER FAILURE</span> LEADING TO <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">DEATH</span> OR TRANSPLANT PER 75,000 PATIENT YEARS OF USE.

<p>FELBAMATE SHOULD NOT BE PRESCRIBED FOR ANYONE WITH A HISTORY OF HEPATIC DYSFUNCTION.</p>
<p>TREATMENT WITH FELBAMATE SHOULD BE INITIATED ONLY IN INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT ACTIVE LIVER DISEASE AND WITH NORMAL BASELINE SERUM TRANSAMINASES. IT HAS NOT BEEN PROVED THAT PERIODIC SERUM TRANSAMINASE TESTING WILL PREVENT SERIOUS INJURY BUT IT IS GENERALLY BELIEVED THAT EARLY DETECTION OF DRUG­INDUCED HEPATIC INJURY ALONG WITH IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL OF THE SUSPECT DRUG ENHANCES THE LIKELIHOOD FOR RECOVERY. THERE IS NO INFORMATION AVAILABLE THAT DOCUMENTS HOW RAPIDLY PATIENTS CAN PROGRESS FROM NORMAL LIVER FUNCTION TO <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">LIVER FAILURE</span>, BUT OTHER DRUGS KNOWN TO BE HEPATOTOXINS CAN CAUSE <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">LIVER FAILURE</span> RAPIDLY (E.G., FROM NORMAL ENZYMES TO <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">LIVER FAILURE</span> IN 2 TO 4 WEEKS). ACCORDINGLY, MONITORING OF SERUM TRANSAMINASE LEVELS (AST AND ALT) IS RECOMMENDED AT BASELINE AND PERIODICALLY THEREAFTER.

<h1><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span></h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action:</span></p>
<p>The mechanism by which felbamate exerts its anticonvulsant activity is unknown, but in animal test systems designed to detect anticonvulsant activity, felbamate has properties in common with other marketed anticonvulsants. Felbamate is effective in mice and rats in the maximal electroshock test, the subcutaneous pentylenetetrazol <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> test, and the subcutaneous picrotoxin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> test. Felbamate also exhibits anticonvulsant activity against <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> induced by intracerebroventricular administration of glutamate in rats and N-methyl-D,L-aspartic acid in mice. Protection against maximal electroshock-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> suggests that felbamate may reduce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> spread, an effect possibly predictive of efficacy in generalized tonic-clonic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106574" conceptname="Partial seizure">partial seizures</span>. Protection against pentylenetetrazol-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> suggests that felbamate may increase <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> threshold, an effect considered to be predictive of potential efficacy in absence <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>.</p>
<p>Receptor-binding studies indicate that felbamate has weak inhibitory effects on GABA-receptor binding, benzodiazepine receptor binding, and is devoid of activity at the MK-801 receptor binding site of the NMDA receptor-ionophore complex. However, felbamate does interact as an antagonist at the strychnine-insensitive glycine recognition site of the NMDA receptor-ionophore complex. Felbamate is not effective in protecting chick embryo retina tissue against the neurotoxic effects of the excitatory amino acid agonists NMDA, kainate, or quisqualate

<p>The monocarbamate, p-hydroxy, and 2-hydroxy metabolites were inactive in the maximal electroshock­induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> test in mice. The monocarbamate and p-hydroxy metabolites had only weak (0.2 to 0.6) activity compared with felbamate in the subcutaneous pentylenetetrazol <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> test. These metabolites did not contribute significantly to the anticonvulsant action of felbamate.</p>
<p><a name="bc7c0c7c-85df-4354-ab31-c1181a086078"></a><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics:</span></p>
<p>The numbers in the pharmacokinetic section are mean ± standard deviation.</p>
<p>Felbamate is well-absorbed after oral administration. Over 90% of the radioactivity after a dose of 1000 mg C felbamate was found in the urine. Absolute bioavailability (oral vs. parenteral) has not been measured. The tablet was shown to be bioequivalent to the capsule used in clinical trials, and pharmacokinetic parameters of the tablet and suspension are similar. There was no effect of food on absorption of the tablet.
                            <span class="Sup">14</span></p>
<p>Following oral administration, felbamate is the predominant plasma species (about 90% of plasma radioactivity). About 40% to 50% of absorbed dose appears unchanged in urine, and an additional 40% is present as unidentified metabolites and conjugates. About 15% is present as parahydroxyfelbamate, 2­hydroxyfelbamate, and felbamate monocarbamate, none of which have significant anticonvulsant activity.</p>
<p>Binding of felbamate to human plasma protein was independent of felbamate concentrations between 10 and 310 micrograms/mL. Binding ranged from 22% to 25%, mostly to albumin, and was dependent on the albumin concentration.</p>
<p>Felbamate is excreted with a terminal half-life of 20 to 23 hours, which is unaltered after multiple doses. Clearance after a single 1200 mg dose is 26±3 mL/hr/kg, and after multiple daily doses of 3600 mg is 30±8 mL/hr/kg. The apparent volume of distribution was 756±82 mL/kg after a 1200 mg dose. Felbamate C and AUC are proportionate to dose after single and multiple doses over a range of 100 to 800 mg single doses and 1200 to 3600 mg daily doses. C (trough) blood levels are also dose proportional. Multiple daily doses of 1200, 2400, and 3600 mg gave C values of 30±5, 55±8, and 83±21 micrograms/mL (N=10 patients). Linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics were also observed at doses above 3600 mg/day up to the maximum dose studied of 6000 mg/day. Felbamate gave dose proportional steady-state peak plasma concentrations in children age 4 to 12 over a range of 15, 30, and 45 mg/kg/day with peak concentrations of 17, 32, and 49 micrograms/mL.
                            <span class="Sub">max</span><span class="Sub">min</span><span class="Sub">min</span></p>
<p>The effects of race and gender on felbamate pharmacokinetics have not been systematically evaluated, but plasma concentrations in males (N=5) and females (N=4) given felbamate have been similar. The effects of felbamate kinetics on hepatic functional impairment have not been evaluated.</p>
<p>Felbamate's single dose monotherapy pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in 12 otherwise healthy individuals with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>. There was a 40% to 50% reduction in total body clearance and 9 to 15 hours prolongation of half-life in renally impaired subjects compared to that in subjects with normal renal function. Reduced felbamate clearance and a longer half-life were associated with diminishing renal function.

<p><span class="Bold">Pharmacodynamics:</span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Typical Physiologic responses:</span></p>
<p>1. In adults, there is no effect of felbamate on blood pressure. Small but statistically significant mean increases in heart rate were seen during adjunctive therapy and monotherapy; however, these mean increases of up to 5 bpm were not clinically significant. In children, no clinically relevant changes in blood pressure or heart rate were seen during adjunctive therapy or monotherapy with felbamate.
                            <span class="Italics">Cardiovascular:</span></p>
<p>2. The only other change in vital signs was a mean decrease of approximately 1 respiration per minute in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4313591" conceptname="Respiratory rate">respiratory rate</span> during adjunctive therapy in children. In adults, statistically significant mean reductions in body weight were observed during felbamate monotherapy and adjunctive therapy. In children, there were mean decreases in body weight during adjunctive therapy and monotherapy; however, these mean changes were not statistically significant. These mean reductions in adults and children were approximately 5% of the mean weights at baseline.
                            <span class="Italics">Other Physiologic Effects:</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">CLINICAL STUDIES</span></p>
<p>The results of controlled clinical trials established the efficacy of felbamate as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in adults with partial-onset <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> with or without secondary generalization and in partial and generalized <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in children.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Felbamate Monotherapy Trials in Adults</span></p>
<p>Felbamate (3600 mg/day given QID) and low-dose valproate (15 mg/kg/day) were compared as monotherapy during a 112-day treatment period in a multicenter and a single-center double-blind efficacy trial. Both trials were conducted according to an identical study design. During a 56-day baseline period, all patients had at least four partial-onset <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> per 28 days and were receiving one antiepileptic drug at a therapeutic level, the most common being carbamazepine. In the multicenter trial, baseline <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> frequencies were 12.4 per 28 days in the felbamate group and 21.3 per 28 days in the low-dose valproate group. In the single-center trial, baseline <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> frequencies were 18.1 per 28 days in the felbamate group and 15.9 per 28 days in the low-dose valproate group. Patients were converted to monotherapy with felbamate or low-dose valproic acid during the first 28 days of the 112-day treatment period. Study endpoints were completion of 112 study days or fulfilling an escape criterion. Criteria for escape relative to baseline were: (1) twofold increase in monthly <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> frequency, (2) twofold increase in highest 2-day <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> frequency, (3) single generalized tonic-clonic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> (GTC) if none occurred during baseline, or (4) significant prolongation of GTCs. The primary efficacy variable was the number of patients in each treatment group who met escape criteria.</p>
<p>In the multicenter trial, the percentage of patients who met escape criteria was 40% (18/45) in the felbamate group and 78% (39/50) in the low-dose valproate group. In the single-center trial, the percentage of patients who met escape criteria was 14% (3/21) in the felbamate group and 90% (19/21) in the low-dose valproate group. In both trials, the difference in the percentage of patients meeting escape criteria was statistically significant (P&lt;.001) in favor of felbamate. These two studies by design were intended to demonstrate the effectiveness of felbamate monotherapy. The studies were not designed or intended to demonstrate comparative efficacy of the two drugs. For example, valproate was not used at the maximally effective dose.</p>
<p>Felbamate Adjunctive Therapy Trials in Adults</p>
<p>A double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial consisted of two 10-week outpatient treatment periods. Patients with refractory partial-onset <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> who were receiving phenytoin and carbamazepine at therapeutic levels were administered felbamate as add-on therapy at a starting dosage of 1400 mg/day in three divided doses, which was increased to 2600 mg/day in three divided doses. Among the 56 patients who completed the study, the baseline <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> frequency was 20 per month. Patients treated with felbamate had fewer <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> than patients treated with placebo for each treatment sequence. There was a 23% (P=.018) difference in percentage <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> frequency reduction in favor of felbamate.</p>
<p>Felbamate 3600 mg/day given QID and placebo were compared in a 28-day double-blind add-on trial in patients who had their standard antiepileptic drugs reduced while undergoing evaluations for surgery of intractable <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>. All patients had confirmed partial-onset <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> with or without generalization, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> frequency during surgical evaluation not exceeding an average of four <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106574" conceptname="Partial seizure">partial seizures</span> per day or more than one generalized <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> per day, and a minimum average of one partial or generalized tonic­clonic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> per day for the last 3 days of the surgical evaluation. The primary efficacy variable was time to fourth <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> after randomization to treatment with felbamate or placebo. Thirteen (46%) of 28 patients in the felbamate group versus 29 (88%) of 33 patients in the placebo group experienced a fourth <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span>. The median times to fourth <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> were greater than 28 days in the felbamate group and 5 days in the placebo group.

<p><span class="Bold">Felbamate Adjunctive Therapy Trial in Children with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome</span></p>
<p>In a 70-day double-blind, placebo-controlled add-on trial in the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, felbamate 45 mg/kg/day given QID was superior to placebo in controlling the multiple <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> types associated with this condition. Patients had at least 90 atonic and/or atypical absence <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> per month while receiving therapeutic dosages of one or two other antiepileptic drugs. Patients had a past history of using an average of eight antiepileptic drugs. The most commonly used antiepileptic drug during the baseline period was valproic acid. The frequency of all types of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> during the baseline period was 1617 per month in the felbamate group and 716 per month in the placebo group. Statistically significant differences in the effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> frequency favored felbamate over placebo for total <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> (26% reduction vs 5% increase, P&lt;.001), atonic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> (44% reduction vs 7% reduction, P=.002), and generalized tonic-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4265182" conceptname="Clonic seizure">clonic seizures</span> (40% reduction vs 12% increase, P=.017).

<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322252" conceptname="Suicidal behavior">Suicidal Behavior</span> and Ideation</span></p>
<p>Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) including felbamate, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</p>
<p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322252" conceptname="Suicidal behavior">suicidal behavior</span> or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>.</p>
<p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</p>
<p>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.</p>

<p><span class="Bold Italics">Specific Effects of Felbamate on Other Antiepileptic Drugs:</span></p>
<p>Felbamate causes an increase in steady-state phenytoin plasma concentrations. In 10 otherwise healthy subjects with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> ingesting phenytoin, the steady-state trough (C ) phenytoin plasma concentration was 17±5 micrograms/mL. The steady-state C increased to 21±5 micrograms/mL when 1200 mg/day of felbamate was coadministered. Increasing the felbamate dose to 1800 mg/day in six of these subjects increased the steady-state phenytoin C to 25±7 micrograms/mL. In order to maintain phenytoin levels, limit adverse experiences, and achieve the felbamate dose of 3600 mg/day, a phenytoin dose reduction of approximately 40% was necessary for eight of these 10 subjects.

<p>In a controlled clinical trial, a 20% reduction of the phenytoin dose at the initiation of felbamate therapy resulted in phenytoin levels comparable to those prior to felbamate administration.</p>
<p>Felbamate causes a decrease in the steady-state carbamazepine plasma concentrations and an increase in the steady-state carbamazepine epoxide plasma concentration. In nine otherwise healthy subjects with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> ingesting carbamazepine, the steady-state trough (C ) carbamazepine concentration was 8±2 micrograms/mL. The carbamazepine steady-state C decreased 31% to 5±1 micrograms/mL when felbamate (3000 mg/day, divided into three doses) was coadministered. Carbamazepine epoxide steady-state C concentrations increased 57% from 1.0±0.3 to 1.6±0.4 micrograms/mL with the addition of felbamate.

<p>In clinical trials, similar changes in carbamazepine and carbamazepine epoxide were seen.</p>
<p>Felbamate causes an increase in steady-state valproate concentrations. In four subjects with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> ingesting valproate, the steady-state trough (C ) valproate plasma concentration was 63±16 micrograms/mL. The steady-state C increased to 78±14 micrograms/mL when 1200 mg/day of felbamate was coadministered. Increasing the felbamate dose to 2400 mg/day increased the steady-state valproate C to 96±25 micrograms/mL. Corresponding values for free valproate C concentrations were 7±3, 9±4, and 11±6 micrograms/mL for 0, 1200, and 2400 mg/day felbamate, respectively. The ratios of the AUCs of unbound valproate to the AUCs of the total valproate were 11.1%, 13.0%, and 11.5%, with coadministration of 0, 1200, and 2400 mg/day of felbamate, respectively. This indicates that the protein binding of valproate did not change appreciably with increasing doses of felbamate.

<p>Coadministration of felbamate with phenobarbital causes an increase in phenobarbital plasma concentrations. In 12 otherwise healthy male volunteers ingesting phenobarbital, the steady-state trough (C ) phenobarbital concentration was 14.2 micrograms/mL. The steady-state C concentration increased to 17.8 micrograms/mL when 2400 mg/day of felbamate was coadministered for one week.

<p>A group of 24 nonsmoking, healthy white female volunteers established on an oral contraceptive regimen containing 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 75 mcg gestodene for at least 3 months received 2400 mg/day of felbamate from midcycle (day 15) to midcycle (day 14) of two consecutive oral contraceptive cycles. Felbamate treatment resulted in a 42% decrease in the gestodene AUC , but no clinically relevant effect was observed on the pharmacokinetic parameters of ethinyl estradiol.

<p>There are no known interactions of felbamate with commonly used laboratory tests.
                            <span class="Bold">Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions:</span></p>
<p>Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats. Mice received felbamate as a feed admixture for 92 weeks at doses of 300, 600, and 1200 mg/kg and rats were also dosed by feed admixture for 104 weeks at doses of 30, 100, and 300 (males) or 10, 30, and 100 (females) mg/kg. The maximum doses in these studies produced steady-state plasma concentrations that were equal to or less than the steady-state plasma concentrations in epileptic patients receiving 3600 mg/day. There was a statistically significant increase in hepatic cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> in high­dose male and female mice and in high-dose female rats. Hepatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4210465" conceptname="Hypertrophy">hypertrophy</span> was significantly increased in a dose-related manner in mice, primarily males, but also in females. Hepatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4210465" conceptname="Hypertrophy">hypertrophy</span> was not found in female rats.

There was a statistically significant increase in benign interstitial cell tumors of the testes in high-dose male rats receiving felbamate. The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown.
                            <span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:</span></p>
<p>As a result of the synthesis process, felbamate could contain small amounts of two known animal carcinogens, the genotoxic compound ethyl carbamate (urethane) and the nongenotoxic compound methyl carbamate. It is theoretically possible that a 50 kg patient receiving 3600 mg of felbamate could be exposed to up to 0.72 micrograms of urethane and 1800 micrograms of methyl carbamate. These daily doses are approximately 1/35,000 (urethane) and 1/5,500 (methyl carbamate) on a mg/kg basis, and 1/10,000 (urethane) and 1/1,600 (methyl carbamate) on a mg/m basis, of the dose levels shown to be carcinogenic in rodents. Any presence of these two compounds in felbamate used in the lifetime carcinogenicity studies was inadequate to cause tumors.
                            <span class="Sup">2</span></p>
<p>Microbial and mammalian cell assays revealed no evidence of mutagenesis in the Ames /microsome plate test, CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell forward gene mutation assay, sister chromatic exchange assay in CHO cells, and bone marrow cytogenetics assay.

<p>Reproduction and fertility studies in rats showed no effects on male or female fertility at oral doses of up to 13.9 times the human total daily dose of 3600 mg on a mg/kg basis, or up to 3 times the human total daily dose on a mg/m basis.
                            <span class="Sup">2</span></p>
<p>The incidence of malformations was not increased compared to control in offspring of rats or rabbits given doses up to 13.9 times (rat) and 4.2 times (rabbit) the human daily dose on a mg/kg basis, or 3 times (rat) and less than 2 times (rabbit) the human daily dose on a mg/m basis. However, in rats, there was a decrease in pup weight and an increase in pup <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> during lactation. The cause for these <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> is not known. The no effect dose for rat pup mortality was 6.9 times the human dose on a mg/kg basis or 1.5 times the human dose on a mg/m basis.

<p>Placental transfer of felbamate occurs in rat pups. There are, however, no studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p>
<p>To provide information regarding the effects of exposure to felbamate, physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking felbamate enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website

<p>The safety and effectiveness of felbamate in children other than those with Lennox­Gastaut syndrome has not been established.
                            <span class="Bold">Pediatric Use:</span></p>
<p>: No systematic studies in geriatric patients have been conducted. Clinical studies of felbamate did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dosage selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

<p>The prescriber should be aware that the figures cited in the following table cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those which prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different investigators, treatments, and uses including the use of felbamate as adjunctive therapy where the incidence of adverse events may be higher due to drug interactions. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side effect incidence rate in the population studied.</p>

<p>Table 4 enumerates adverse events that occurred at an incidence of 2% or more among 114 adult patients who received felbamate adjunctive therapy in add-on controlled trials at dosages up to 3600 mg/day. Reported adverse events were classified using standard WHO-based dictionary terminology.</p>
<p>Many adverse experiences that occurred during adjunctive therapy may be a result of drug interactions. Adverse experiences during adjunctive therapy typically resolved with conversion to monotherapy, or with adjustment of the dosage of other antiepileptic drugs.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">Other Events Observed in Association with the Administration of Felbamate:</span></p>
<p>In the paragraphs that follow, the adverse clinical events, other than those in the preceding tables, that occurred in a total of 977 adults and 357 children exposed to felbamate and that are reasonably associated with its use are presented. They are listed in order of decreasing frequency. Because the reports cite events observed in open-label and uncontrolled studies, the role of felbamate in their causation cannot be reliably determined.</p>
<p>Events are classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; and rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.</p>
<p>Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients reporting an event divided by the total number of patients (N=1334) exposed to felbamate.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span></h1>
<p class="First">Felbamate tablets have been studied as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in adults and as adjunctive therapy in children with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. As felbamate tablets are added to or substituted for existing AEDs, it is strongly recommended to reduce the dosage of those AEDs in the range of 20% to 33% to minimize side effects (see subsection).
                            <span class="Bold"><a href="#b29467e5-6e9d-4569-aa57-0c59de0619f0">Drug Interactions</a></span></p>
<p>Felbamate should be used with caution in patients with renal dysfunction. In the renally impaired, starting and maintenance doses should be reduced by one-half (See / and ). Adjunctive therapy with medications which affect felbamate plasma concentrations, especially AEDs, may warrant further reductions in felbamate daily doses in patients with renal dysfunction.

<p><span class="Bold Underline">Adults (14 years of age and over)</span></p>
<p>The majority of patients received 3600 mg/day in clinical trials evaluating its use as both monotherapy and adjunctive therapy.</p>
<p>(Initial therapy) Felbamate tablets have not been systematically evaluated as initial monotherapy. Initiate felbamate tablets at 1200 mg/day in divided doses three or four times daily. The prescriber is advised to titrate previously untreated patients under close clinical supervision, increasing the dosage in 600-mg increments every 2 weeks to 2400 mg/day based on clinical response and thereafter to 3600 mg/day if clinically indicated.

Reduce the dosage of concomitant AEDs by one-third at initiation of felbamate tablets therapy. At week 2, increase the felbamate tablet dosage to 2400 mg/day while reducing the dosage of other AEDs up to an additional one-third of their original dosage. At week 3, increase the felbamate tablet dosage up to 3600 mg/day and continue to reduce the dosage of other AEDs as clinically indicated.

Further reductions of the concomitant AEDs dosage may be necessary to minimize side effects due to drug interactions. Increase the dosage of felbamate by 1200 mg/day increments at weekly intervals to 3600 mg/day. Most side effects seen during felbamate tablet adjunctive therapy resolve as the dosage of concomitant AEDs is decreased.

<p>While the above felbamate tablet conversion guidelines may result in a felbamate tablet 3600 mg/day dose within 3 weeks, in some patients titration to a 3600 mg/day felbamate tablet dose has been achieved in as little as 3 days with appropriate adjustment of other AEDs.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Underline">Children with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (Ages 2 to 14 years)</span></p>
<p>Felbamate tablets should be added at 15 mg/kg/day in divided doses three or four times daily while reducing present AEDs by 20% in order to control plasma levels of concurrent phenytoin, valproic acid, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine and its metabolites. Further reductions of the concomitant AEDs dosage may be necessary to minimize side effects due to drug interactions. Increase the dosage of felbamate tablets by 15 mg/kg/day increments at weekly intervals to 45 mg/kg/day. Most side effects seen during felbamate tablet adjunctive therapy resolve as the dosage of concomitant AEDs is decreased.

<p>FELBAMATE SHOULD NOT BE USED BY PATIENTS UNTIL THERE HAS BEEN A COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF THE RISKS.</p>
<p>All patients treated with felbamate should acknowledge that they understand the risks and other information about felbamate discussed below, and physicians should acknowledge this discussion.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND WARNING:</p>
<p>Felbamate, taken by itself or with other prescription and/or non-prescription drugs, can result in a severe, potentially fatal blood abnormality ("<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137829" conceptname="Aplastic anemia">aplastic anemia</span>") and/or severe, potentially fatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver damage</span>.</p>
<p>PATIENT ACKNOWLEDGMENT:</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Do not sign this form if there is anything you do not understand about the information you have received. Ask your doctor about anything you do not understand before you initial any of the items below or sign this form.</span></p>
<p>My [My son, daughter, ward _______________________________________________________'s]</p>
<p>treatment with felbamate has been personally explained to me by Dr.________________________.</p>
<p>The following points of information, among others, have been specifically discussed and made clear and I have had the opportunity to ask any questions concerning this information:</p>
<p>1. I, _______________________________________________________________ (Patient's Name),</p>
<p>understand that felbamate is used to treat certain types of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> and my physician has told me that I have this type(s) of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>;</p>
<p>INITIALS: __________________________</p>
<p>2. I understand that felbamate is being used because my <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> have not been satisfactorily treated with other antiepileptic drugs;</p>
<p>INITIALS: __________________________</p>
<p>3. I understand that there is a serious risk that I could develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137829" conceptname="Aplastic anemia">aplastic anemia</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">liver failure</span>, both of which are potentially fatal, by using felbamate;</p>
<p>INITIALS: __________________________</p>
<p>4. I understand that there are no laboratory tests which will predict if I am at an increased risk for one of the potentially fatal conditions;</p>
<p>INITIALS: __________________________</p>
<p>5. I understand that I should have the recommended blood work before my treatment with felbamate is begun (baseline) and periodically thereafter as clinical judgement warrants. I understand that although this blood work may help detect if I develop one of these conditions, it may do so only after significant, irreversible and potentially fatal damage has already occurred;</p>
<p>INITIALS: __________________________</p>
<p>6. If I am currently taking other antiepileptic drugs, I understand that the manufacturer of felbamate recommends that the dosage of these other drugs be decreased by a certain amount when felbamate is started; if my physician determines that this should not be done in my case, he/she has explained the reason(s) for this decision;</p>
<p>INITIALS: __________________________</p>
<p>7. I understand that I must immediately report any unusual symptoms to Dr. _______________________ and be especially aware of any <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rashes</span>, easy <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441737" conceptname="Contusion">bruising</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="26711" conceptname="Chronic pharyngitis">sore throats</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, and/or dark urine;</p>
<p>INITIALS: __________________________</p>
<p>8. I understand that antiepileptic drugs such as felbamate may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. I understand that I must immediately report any unusual changes in mood or behavior, symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> or thoughts about self-harm to Dr. ____________________.</p>
