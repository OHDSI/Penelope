<h2><span class="Italics">Mechanism of Action</span></h2>
<p class="First">Frovatriptan is a 5-HT receptor agonist that binds with
                                    high affinity for 5-HT<span class="Sub">1B</span> and 5-HT<span class="Sub">1D</span>
                                    receptors. Frovatriptan has no significant effects on
                                    GABA<span class="Sub">A</span> mediated channel activity and has no
                                    significant affinity for benzodiazepine binding sites.</p>
<p>Frovatriptan is believed to act on extracerebral,
                                    intracranial arteries and to inhibit excessive dilation of these
                                    vessels in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">migraine</span>. In anesthetized dogs and cats, intravenous
                                    administration of frovatriptan produced selective constriction
                                    of the carotid vascular bed and had no effect on blood pressure
                                    (both species) or coronary resistance (in dogs).</p>

<h2><span class="Italics">Pharmacokinetics</span></h2>
<p class="First">Mean maximum blood concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) in
                                    patients are achieved approximately 2 - 4 hours after
                                    administration of a single oral dose of frovatriptan 2.5 mg. The
                                    absolute bioavailability of an oral dose of frovatriptan 2.5 mg
                                    in healthy subjects is about 20% in males and 30% in females.
                                    Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of
                                    frovatriptan, but delays t<span class="Sub">max</span> by one hour.</p>
<p>Binding of frovatriptan to serum proteins is low
                                    (approximately 15%). Reversible binding to blood cells at
                                    equilibrium is approximately 60%, resulting in a blood:plasma
                                    ratio of about 2:1 in both males and females. The mean steady
                                    state volume of distribution of frovatriptan following
                                    intravenous administration of 0.8 mg is 4.2 L/kg in males and
                                    3.0 L/kg in females.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vitro,
                                    </span>cytochrome P450 1A2 appears to be the principal enzyme
                                    involved in the metabolism of frovatriptan. Following
                                    administration of a single oral dose of radiolabeled
                                    frovatriptan 2.5 mg to healthy male and female subjects, 32% of
                                    the dose was recovered in urine and 62% in feces. Radiolabeled
                                    compounds excreted in urine were unchanged frovatriptan,
                                    hydroxylated frovatriptan, N-acetyl desmethyl frovatriptan,
                                    hydroxylated N-acetyl desmethyl frovatriptan and desmethyl
                                    frovatriptan, together with several other minor metabolites.
                                    Desmethyl frovatriptan has lower affinity for
                                    5-HT<span class="Sub">1B/1D</span> receptors compared to the parent compound.
                                    The N-acetyl desmethyl metabolite has no significant affinity
                                    for 5-HT receptors. The activity of the other metabolites is
                                    unknown.</p>
<p>After an intravenous dose, mean clearance of frovatriptan
                                    was 220 and 130 mL/min in males and females, respectively. Renal
                                    clearance accounted for about 40% (82 mL/min) and 45% (60
                                    mL/min) of total clearance in males and females, respectively.
                                    The mean terminal elimination half-life of frovatriptan in both
                                    males and females is approximately 26 hours.</p>

                                    placebo-controlled, outpatient trials. Two of these were
                                    dose-finding studies in which patients were randomized to
                                    receive doses of frovatriptan ranging from 0.5 - 40 mg. The
                                    three studies evaluating only one dose studied 2.5 mg. In these
                                    controlled short-term studies combined, patients were
                                    predominately female (88%) and Caucasian (94%) with a mean age
                                    of 42 years (range 18 - 69). Patients were instructed to treat a
                                    moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">Headache</span> response, defined as a

                                    The associated symptoms <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260194" conceptname="Photophobia">photophobia</span> and

                                    assessed for up to 24 hours post dose. In two of the trials a
                                    second dose of FROVA was provided after the initial treatment,
                                    to treat recurrence of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> within 24 hours. Other
                                    medication, excluding other 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists and
                                    ergotamine containing compounds, was permitted from 2 hours
                                    after the first dose of FROVA. The frequency and time to use of
                                    additional medications were also recorded.</p>
<p>In all five placebo-controlled trials, the percentage of
                                    patients achieving a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> response 2 hours after treatment
                                    was significantly greater for those taking FROVA compared to
                                    those taking placebo (Table 1).</p>
<p>Lower doses of frovatriptan (1 mg or 0.5 mg) were not
                                    effective at 2 hours. Higher doses (5 mg to 40 mg) of
                                    frovatriptan showed no added benefit over 2.5 mg but did cause a
                                    greater incidence of adverse events.</p>

<p>For patients with risk factors predictive of CAD, who are
                                    determined to have a satisfactory cardiovascular evaluation, it
                                    is strongly recommended that administration of the first dose of
                                    frovatriptan take place in the setting of a
                                    physician’s office or similar medically staffed and

                                    of clinical symptoms, consideration should be given to obtaining
                                    on the first occasion of use an electrocardiogram (ECG) during
                                    the interval immediately following administration of FROVA in
                                    these patients with risk factors.</p>
<p>It is recommended that patients who are intermittent
                                    long-term users of 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists, including FROVA
                                    and who have or acquire risk factors predictive of CAD, as
                                    described above, undergo periodic cardiovascular evaluation as
                                    they continue to use FROVA. </p>
<p>The systematic approach described above is intended to
                                    reduce the likelihood that patients with unrecognized

<h2><span class="Italics">Binding to Melanin-Containing
                                Tissues:</span></h2>
<p class="First">When pigmented rats were given a single oral dose of 5
                                    mg/kg of radiolabeled frovatriptan, the radioactivity in the eye
                                    after 28 days was 87% of the value measured after 8 hours. This
                                    suggests that frovatriptan and/or its metabolites may bind to
                                    the melanin of the eye. Because there could be accumulation in
                                    melanin rich tissues over time, this raises the possibility that
                                    frovatriptan could cause toxicity in these tissues after
                                    extended use. However, no effects on the retina related to
                                    treatment with frovatriptan were noted in the toxicity studies.
                                    Although no systematic monitoring of ophthalmologic function was
                                    undertaken in clinical trials and no specific recommendations
                                    for ophthalmologic monitoring are made, prescribers should be

<p class="First">It is not known whether frovatriptan is excreted in human
                                    milk. Frovatriptan and/or its metabolites are excreted in the
                                    milk of lactating rats with the maximum concentration being
                                    four-fold higher than that seen in blood. Therefore, caution
                                    should be exercised when considering the administration of FROVA
                                    to a nursing woman.</p>

<p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of FROVA in pediatric patients
                                    have not been established; therefore, FROVA is not recommended
                                    for use in patients under 18 years of age. Postmarketing
                                    experience with other triptans includes a limited number of
                                    reports that describe pediatric patients who have experienced
                                    clinically serious adverse events that are similar in nature to
                                    those reported rarely in adults.</p>

<p class="First">Because these events are reported voluntarily from a

<h1>DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></h1>
<p class="First">Although the abuse potential of FROVA has not been specifically
                            assessed in clinical trials, no abuse of, tolerance to, withdrawal from,
                            or drug-seeking behavior was observed in patients who received FROVA.
                            The 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists, as a class, have not been associated with
                            drug abuse.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">There is no direct experience of any patient taking an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>
                            of FROVA. The maximum single dose of frovatriptan given to male and
                            female patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">migraine</span> was 40 mg (16 times the clinical dose) and
                            the maximum single dose given to healthy male subjects was 100 mg (40
                            times the clinical dose) without significant adverse events.</p>
<p>As with other 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor agonists, there is no
                            specific antidote for frovatriptan. The elimination half-life of
                            frovatriptan is 26 hours, therefore if <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> occurs, the patient
                            should be monitored closely for at least 48 hours and be given any
                            necessary symptomatic treatment. </p>
<p>The effects of hemo- or peritoneal dialysis on blood
                            concentrations of frovatriptan are unknown.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">The recommended dose is a single tablet of FROVA (frovatriptan
                            2.5 mg) taken orally with fluids.</p>
<p>If the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> recurs after initial relief, a second tablet may
                            be taken, providing there is an interval of at least 2 hours between
                            doses. The total daily dose of frovatriptan should not exceed 3 tablets
                            (3 x 2.5 mg per day).</p>
<p>There is no evidence that a second dose of frovatriptan is
                            effective in patients who do not respond to a first dose of the drug for
                            the same <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>. </p>
