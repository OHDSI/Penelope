<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"></span>The principal metabolite of quinapril, quinaprilat, is an inhibitor of ACE activity in human subjects and animals. ACE is peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor, angiotensin II. The effect of quinapril in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> appears to result primarily from the inhibition of circulating and tissue ACE activity, thereby reducing angiotensin II formation. </p>
<p>Quinapril inhibits the elevation in blood pressure caused by intravenously administered angiotensin I, but has no effect on the pressor response to angiotensin II, norepinephrine, or epinephrine. Angiotensin II also stimulates the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, thereby facilitating renal sodium and fluid reabsorption. Reduced aldosterone secretion by quinapril may result in a small increase in serum potassium. In controlled <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> trials, treatment with quinapril alone resulted in mean increases in potassium of 0.07 mmol/L (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#PRECAUTIONS">P</a><a href="#PRECAUTIONS">RECAU</a><a href="#PRECAUTIONS">TIONS</a></span>). Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity (PRA). </p>
<p>While the principal mechanism of antihypertensive effect is thought to be through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, quinapril exerts antihypertensive actions even in patients with low renin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>. Quinapril was an effective antihypertensive in all races studied, although it was somewhat less effective in blacks (usually a predominantly low renin group) than in non-blacks. ACE is identical to kininase II, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin, a potent peptide vasodilator; whether increased levels of bradykinin play a role in the therapeutic effect of quinapril remains to be elucidated. </p>
<p>Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin, so coadministration of an ACE inhibitor tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.  </p>
<p>The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</span></p>
<p>The rate and extent of absorption of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide from quinapril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are not different, respectively, from the rate and extent of absorption of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide from immediate-release monotherapy formulations, either administered concurrently or separately. Following oral administration of quinapril (quinapril monotherapy) tablets, peak plasma quinapril concentrations are observed within 1 hour. Based on recovery of quinapril and its metabolites in urine, the extent of absorption is at least 60%. The absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is somewhat slower (1 to 2.5 hours) and more complete (50% to 80%). </p>
<p>The rate of quinapril absorption was reduced by 14% when quinapril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets were administered with a high-fat meal as compared to fasting, while the extent of absorption was not affected. The rate of hydrochlorothiazide absorption was reduced by 12% when quinapril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets were administered with a high-fat meal, while the extent of absorption was not significantly affected. Therefore, quinapril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be administered without regard to food.</p>
<p>Following absorption, quinapril is deesterified to its major active metabolite, quinaprilat (about 38% of oral dose), and to other minor inactive metabolites. Following multiple oral dosing of quinapril, there is an effective accumulation half-life of quinaprilat of approximately 3 hours, and peak plasma quinaprilat concentrations are observed approximately 2 hours postdose. Approximately 97% of either quinapril or quinaprilat circulating in plasma is bound to proteins. Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized. Its apparent volume of distribution is 3.6 to 7.8 L/kg, consistent with measured plasma protein binding of 67.9%. The drug also accumulates in red blood cells, so that whole blood levels are 1.6 to 1.8 times those measured in plasma. </p>
<p>Some placental passage occurred when quinapril was administered to pregnant rats. Studies in rats indicate that quinapril and its metabolites do not cross the blood-brain barrier. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta freely but not the blood-brain barrier.  </p>
<p>Quinaprilat is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, up to 96% of an IV dose, and has an elimination half-life in plasma of approximately 2 hours and a prolonged terminal phase with a half-life of 25 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide is excreted unchanged by the kidney. When plasma levels have been followed for at least 24 hours, the plasma half-life has been observed to vary between 4 to 15 hours. At least 61% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. </p>
<p>In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>, the elimination half-life of quinaprilat increases as creatinine clearance decreases. There is a linear correlation between plasma quinaprilat clearance and creatinine clearance. In patients with end-stage <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>, chronic hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis have little effect on the elimination of quinapril and quinaprilat.</p>
<p>Elimination of quinaprilat is reduced in elderly patients (≥65 years) and in those with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>; this reduction is attributable to decrease in renal function (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#_6975D915-A479-6688-6018-A0ED32915745">DOSAGE AND </a><a href="#_6975D915-A479-6688-6018-A0ED32915745">ADMINISTRATION</a></span>). Quinaprilat concentrations are reduced in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196463" conceptname="Alcoholic cirrhosis">alcoholic cirrhosis</span> due to impaired deesterification of quinapril. In a study of patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> (mean creatinine clearance of 19 mL/min), the half-life of hydrochlorothiazide elimination was lengthened to 21 hours. </p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of quinapril and quinaprilat are linear over a single-dose range of 5- to 80-mg doses and 40- to 160-mg in multiple daily doses.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"></span>Single doses of 20 mg of quinapril provide over 80% inhibition of plasma ACE for 24 hours. Inhibition of the pressor response to angiotensin I is shorter-lived, with a 20-mg dose giving 75% inhibition for about 4 hours, 50% inhibition for about 8 hours, and 20% inhibition at 24 hours. With chronic dosing, however, there is substantial inhibition of angiotensin II levels at 24 hours by doses of 20 to 80 mg.</p>
<p>Administration of 10 to 80 mg of quinapril to patients with mild to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> results in a reduction of sitting and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with minimal effect on heart rate. Symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span> is infrequent, although it can occur in patients who are salt- and/or volume-depleted (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#WARNINGS">W</a><a href="#WARNINGS">AR</a><a href="#WARNINGS">NINGS</a></span>).</p>
<p>Antihypertensive activity commences within 1 hour with peak effects usually achieved by 2 to 4 hours after dosing. During chronic therapy, most of the blood pressure lowering effect of a given dose is obtained in 1 to 2 weeks. In multiple-dose studies, 10 to 80 mg per day in single or divided doses lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure throughout the dosing interval, with a trough effect of about 5 to 11/3 to 7 mm Hg. The trough effect represents about 50% of the peak effect. </p>
<p>While the dose-response relationship is relatively flat, doses of 40 to 80 mg were somewhat more effective at trough than 10 to 20 mg, and twice-daily dosing tended to give a somewhat lower trough blood pressure than once-daily dosing with the same total dose. The antihypertensive effect of quinapril continues during long-term therapy, with no evidence of loss of effectiveness. </p>
<p>Hemodynamic assessments in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> indicate that blood pressure reduction produced by quinapril is accompanied by a reduction in total peripheral resistance and renal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span> with little or no change in heart rate, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208254" conceptname="Cardiac index">cardiac index</span>, renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, or filtration fraction. </p>
<p>Therapeutic effects of quinapril appear to be the same for elderly (≥65 years of age) and younger adult patients given the same daily dosages, with no increase in adverse events in elderly patients. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, quinapril 10 to 40 mg was similar in effectiveness to captopril, enalapril, propranolol, and thiazide diuretics. </p>
<p>After oral administration of hydrochlorothiazide, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span> begins within 2 hours, peaks in about 4 hours, and lasts about 6 to 12 hours. Use of quinapril with a thiazide diuretic gives blood pressure lowering effect greater than that seen with either agent alone. In clinical trials of quinapril/hydrochlorothiazide using quinapril doses of 2.5 to 40 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 to 25 mg, the antihypertensive effects were sustained for at least 24 hours, and increased with increasing dose of either component. Although quinapril monotherapy is somewhat less effective in blacks than in non-blacks, the efficacy of combination therapy appears to be independent of race. By blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, administration of quinapril tends to reduce the potassium loss associated with the diuretic. In clinical trials of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide the average change in serum potassium was near zero when 2.5 to 40 mg of quinapril was combined with hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg, and the average subject who received 10 to 20/12.5 to 25 mg experienced a milder reduction in serum potassium than that experienced by the average subject receiving the same dose of hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy.</p>

Volume and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">salt depletion</span> should be corrected before initiating therapy with quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide. </p>
<p>Quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide should be used cautiously in patients receiving concomitant therapy with other antihypertensives. The thiazide component of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide may potentiate the action of other antihypertensive drugs, especially ganglionic or peripheral adrenergic-blocking drugs. The antihypertensive effects of the thiazide component may also be enhanced in the postsympathectomy patients. </p>
<p>In patients at risk of excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, therapy with quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide should be started under close medical supervision. Such patients should be followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dosage of quinapril or diuretic is increased. Similar considerations may apply to patients with ischemic heart or cerebrovascular disease in whom an excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314171" conceptname="Low blood pressure reading">fall in blood pressure</span> could result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">cerebrovascular accident</span>. </p>
<p>If excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position and, if necessary, treated with intravenous infusion of normal saline. Quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide treatment usually can be continued following restoration of blood pressure and volume. If symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> develops, a dose reduction or discontinuation of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide may be necessary.</p>

<p>When the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is inhibited by quinapril, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals.

<p>Some quinapril-treated hypertensive patients with no apparent preexisting renal vascular diseases have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when quinapril has been given concomitantly with a diuretic.

When pregnancy is detected, discontinue quinapril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus.</p>
<p>In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus.

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and fertility studies have not been conducted in animals with quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide. </p>
<p>Quinapril hydrochloride was not carcinogenic in mice or rats when given in doses up to 75 or 100 mg/kg/day (50 or 60 times the maximum human daily dose, respectively, on a mg/kg basis and 3.8 or 10 times the maximum human daily dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) for 104 weeks. Female rats given the highest dose level had an increased incidence of mesenteric lymph node <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441818" conceptname="Hemangioma">hemangiomas</span> and skin/subcutaneous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440358" conceptname="Lipoma">lipomas</span>. Neither quinapril nor quinaprilat were mutagenic in the Ames bacterial assay with or without metabolic activation. Quinapril was also negative in the following genetic toxicology studies: <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> mammalian cell point mutation, sister chromatid exchange in cultured mammalian cells, micronucleus test with mice, <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> chromosome aberration with V79 cultured lung cells, and in an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> cytogenetic study with rat bone marrow. There were no adverse effects on fertility or reproduction in rats at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (60 and 10 times the maximum daily human dose when based on mg/kg and mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, respectively). </p>
<p>Under the auspices of the National Toxicology Program, rats and mice received hydrochlorothiazide in their feed for 2 years, at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in mice and up to 100 mg/kg/day in rats. These studies uncovered no evidence of a carcinogenic potential of hydrochlorothiazide in rats or female mice, but there was "equivocal" evidence of hepatocarcinogenicity in male mice. Hydrochlorothiazide was not genotoxic in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> assays using <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, TA 1537, and TA 1538 of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span> typhimurium (the Ames test); in the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) test for chromosomal aberrations; or <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> assays using mouse germinal cell chromosomes, Chinese hamster bone marrow chromosomes, and the Drosophila sex-linked recessive lethal trait gene. Positive test results were obtained in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> CHO sister chromatid exchange (clastogenicity) test and in the mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> cell (mutagenicity) assays, using concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide of 43 to 1300 mcg/mL. Positive test results were also obtained in the Aspergillus nidulans nondisjunction assay, using an unspecified concentration of hydrochlorothiazide. </p>
<p>Hydrochlorothiazide had no adverse effects on the fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies wherein these species were exposed, via their diets, to doses of up to 100 and 4 mg/kg/day, respectively, prior to mating and throughout gestation.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Because quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide are secreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide is administered to a nursing woman.</p>
<p>Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from hydrochlorothiazide and the unknown effects of quinapril in infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.<span class="Bold"> </span></p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of quinapril HCl/hydrochlorothiazide did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide has been evaluated for safety in 1571 patients in controlled and uncontrolled studies. Of these, 498 were given quinapril plus hydrochlorothiazide for at least 1 year, with 153 patients extending combination therapy for over 2 years. In clinical trials with quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide, no adverse experience specific to the combination has been observed. Adverse experiences that have occurred have been limited to those that have been previously reported with quinapril or hydrochlorothiazide. </p>
<p>Adverse experiences were usually mild and transient, and there was no relationship between side effects and age, sex, race, or duration of therapy. Discontinuation of therapy because of adverse effects was required in 2.1% in patients in controlled studies. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> (1.0%; see <span class="Bold"><a href="#PRECAUTIONS">PRECAU</a><a href="#PRECAUTIONS">TIONS</a></span>) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> (0.7%).  </p>
<p>Adverse experiences probably or possibly related to therapy or of unknown relationship to therapy occurring in 1% or more of the 943 patients treated with quinapril plus hydrochlorothiazide in controlled trials are shown below.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide or quinapril monotherapy; treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Therapy with quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide should be discontinued, and the patient should be observed. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435796" conceptname="Dehydration">Dehydration</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022093" conceptname="Electrolyte imbalance">electrolyte imbalance</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> should be treated by established procedures. </p>
<p>The oral median lethal dose of quinapril/hydrochlorothiazide in combination ranges from 1063/664 to 4640/2896 mg/kg in mice and rats. Doses of 1440 to 4280 mg/kg of quinapril cause significant lethality in mice and rats. In single-dose studies of hydrochlorothiazide, most rats survived doses up to 2.75 g/kg. </p>
<p>Data from human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> of ACE inhibitors are scanty; the most likely manifestation of human quinapril overdosage is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>. In human hydrochlorothiazide <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, the most common signs and symptoms observed have been those of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435796" conceptname="Dehydration">dehydration</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4077438" conceptname="Electrolyte depletion">electrolyte depletion</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4016089" conceptname="Hypochloremia">hypochloremia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">hyponatremia</span>). If digitalis has also been administered, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span> may accentuate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmias</span>. </p>
<p>Laboratory determinations of serum levels of quinapril and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of quinapril <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>.</p>
<p>No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of quinapril and its metabolites. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis have little effect on the elimination of quinapril and quinaprilat.</p>
<p>Angiotensin II could presumably serve as a specific antagonist-antidote in the setting of quinapril <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, but angiotensin II is essentially unavailable outside of scattered research facilities. Because the hypotensive effect of quinapril is achieved through vasodilation and effective <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436375" conceptname="Hypovolemia">hypovolemia</span>, it is reasonable to treat quinapril <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> by infusion of normal saline solution.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">As individual monotherapy, quinapril is an effective treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> in once-daily doses of 10 to 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 to 50 mg. In clinical trials of quinapril/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using quinapril doses of 2.5 to 40 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 to 25 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing dose of either component. </p>
<p>The side effects (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#WARNINGS">WARNINGS</a></span>) of quinapril are generally rare and apparently independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>) and dose-independent phenomena (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192640" conceptname="Pancreatitis">pancreatitis</span>), the former much more common than the latter. Therapy with any combination of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide will be associated with both sets of dose-independent side effects, but regimens that combine low doses of hydrochlorothiazide with quinapril produce minimal effects on serum potassium. In clinical trials of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide, the average change in serum potassium was near zero in subjects who received hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg in the combination, and the average subject who received 10 to 40/12.5 to 25 mg experienced a milder reduction in serum potassium than that experienced by the average subject receiving the same dose of hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy. </p>
<p>To minimize dose-independent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy.<span class="Bold"> </span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Therapy Guided by Clinical Effect</span></p>
<p>Patients whose blood pressures are not adequately controlled with quinapril monotherapy may instead be given quinapril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 10 mg/12.5 mg or 20 mg/12.5 mg. Further increases of either or both components could depend on clinical response. The hydrochlorothiazide dose should generally not be increased until 2 to 3 weeks have elapsed. Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 25 mg of daily hydrochlorothiazide, but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen, may achieve blood pressure control with less <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022093" conceptname="Electrolyte imbalance">electrolyte disturbance</span> if they are switched to quinapril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 10 mg/12.5 mg or 20 mg/12.5 mg.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"></span><span class="Bold">Replacement Therapy</span></p>
<p>For convenience, patients who are adequately treated with 20 mg of quinapril and 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide and experience no significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022093" conceptname="Electrolyte imbalance">electrolyte disturbances</span> may instead wish to receive quinapril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 20 mg/25 mg.</p>

<p><span class="Bold"></span>Regimens of therapy with quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide need not take account of renal function as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is &gt;30 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span> (serum creatinine roughly ≤3 mg/dL or 265 mcmol/L). In patients with more severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides. Therefore, quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are not recommended for use in these patients.<span class="Bold"></span></p>
