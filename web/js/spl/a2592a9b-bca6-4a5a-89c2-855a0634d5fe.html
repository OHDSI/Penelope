<h1>WARNING</h1>
<p class="First">Cladribine injection should be administered under the supervision of a qualified physician experienced in the use of antineoplastic therapy.Â  Suppression of bone marrow function should be anticipated.Â  This is usually reversible and appears to be dose dependent.Â  Serious neurological toxicity (including irreversible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4081615" conceptname="Paraparesis">paraparesis</span> and quadraparesis) has been reported in patients who received cladribine injection by continuous infusion at high doses (four to nine times the recommended dose for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4038845" conceptname="Hairy cell leukemia">Hairy Cell Leukemia</span>).Â  Neurologic toxicity appears to demonstrate a dose relationship; however, severe neurological toxicity has been reported rarely following treatment with standard cladribine dosing regimens.</p>
<p>Acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126119" conceptname="Toxic nephropathy">nephrotoxicity</span> has been observed with high doses of cladribine injection (four to nine times the recommended dose for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4038845" conceptname="Hairy cell leukemia">Hairy Cell Leukemia</span>), especially when given concomitantly with other nephrotoxic agents/therapies.</p>

<h1>DESCRIPTION:</h1>
<p class="First">Cladribine Injection, USP (also commonly known as 2-chloro-2â€™-deoxy-ÃŸ-D-adenosine) is a synthetic antineoplastic agent for continuous intravenous infusion.Â  It is a clear, colorless, sterile, preservative-free, isotonic solution.Â  Cladribine injection, USP is available in single-dose vials containing 10 mg (1 mg/mL) of cladribine, a chlorinated purine nucleoside analog.Â  Each milliliter of cladribine injection, USPÂ contains 1 mg of the active ingredient and 9 mg (0.15 mEq) of sodium chloride as an inactive ingredient.Â  The solution has a pH range of 5.5 to 8.0.Â  Phosphoric acid and/or dibasic sodium phosphate may have been added to adjust the pH to 6.3 Â± 0.3.</p>
<p>The chemical name for cladribine is 2-chloro-6-amino-9-(2-deoxy-ÃŸ-D-erythropento-furanosyl) purine and the structure is represented below:</p>

<h2>Cellular Resistance and Sensitivity</h2>
<p class="First">The selective toxicity of 2-chloro-2â€™-deoxy-ÃŸ-D-adenosine towards certain normal and malignant lymphocyte and monocyte populations is based on the relative activities of deoxycytidine kinase to deoxynucleotidase.Â  Cladribine passively crosses the cell membrane.Â  In cells with a high ratio of deoxycytidine kinase to deoxynucleotidase, it is phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase to 2-chloro-2â€™-deoxy-ÃŸ-D-adenosine monophosphate (2-CdAMP).Â  Since 2-chloro-2â€™-deoxy-ÃŸ-D-adenosine is resistant to deamination by adenosine deaminase and there is little deoxynucleotide deaminase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span> and monocytes, 2-CdAMP accumulates intracellularly and is subsequently converted into the active triphosphate deoxynucleotide,2-chloro-2â€™-deoxy-ÃŸ-D-adenosine triphosphate (2-CdATP).Â  It is postulated that cells with high deoxycytidine kinase and low deoxynucleotidase activities will be selectively killed by 2-chloro-2â€™-deoxy-ÃŸ-D-adenosine as toxic deoxynucleotides accumulate intracellularly.</p>
<p>Cells containing high concentrations of deoxynucleotides are unable to properly repair single-strand DNA breaks.Â  The broken ends of DNA activate the enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase resulting in NAD and ATP depletion and disruption of cellular metabolism.Â  There is evidence, also, that 2-CdATP is incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells, resulting in impairment of DNA synthesis.Â  Thus, 2-chloro-2â€™-deoxy-ÃŸ-D-adenosine can be distinguished from other chemotherapeutic agents affecting purine metabolism in that it is cytotoxic to both actively dividing and quiescent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span> and monocytes, inhibiting both DNA synthesis and repair.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">In a clinical investigation, 17 patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4038845" conceptname="Hairy cell leukemia">Hairy Cell Leukemia</span> (HCL) and normal renal function were treated for seven days with the recommended treatment regimen of cladribine injection (0.09 mg/kg/day) by continuous intravenous infusion.Â  The mean steady-state serum concentration was estimated to be 5.7 ng/mL with an estimated systemic clearance of 663.5 mL/h/kg when cladribine injection was given by continuous infusion over seven days.Â  In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4038845" conceptname="Hairy cell leukemia">Hairy Cell Leukemia</span> patients, there does not appear to be a relationship between serum concentrations and ultimate clinical outcome.</p>
<p>In another study, eight patients with hematologic malignancies received a two (2) hour infusion of cladribine injection (0.12 mg/kg).Â  The mean end-of-infusion plasma cladribine injection concentration was 48 Â± 19 ng/mL.Â  For five of these patients, the disappearance of cladribine injection could be described by either a biphasic or triphasic decline.Â  For these patients with normal renal function, the mean terminal half-life was 5.4 hours.Â  Mean values for clearance and steady-state volume of distribution were 978 Â± 422 mL/h/kg and 4.5 Â± 2.8 L/kg, respectively.</p>
<p>Cladribine plasma concentration after intravenous administration declines multi-exponentially with an average half-life of 6.7 +/- 2.5 hours.Â  In general, the apparent volume of distribution of cladribine is approximately 9 L/kg, indicating an extensive distribution in body tissues.</p>
<p>Cladribine penetrates into cerebrospinal fluid.Â  One report indicates that concentrations are approximately 25% of those in plasma.</p>
<p>Cladribine injection is bound approximately 20% to plasma proteins.</p>
<p>Except for some understanding of the mechanism of cellular toxicity, no other information is available on the metabolism of cladribine injection in humans.Â  An average of 18% of the administered dose has been reported to be excreted in urine of patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030314" conceptname="Neoplasm">solid tumors</span> during a five-day continuous intravenous infusion of 3.5 to 8.1 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day of cladribine injection.Â  The effect of renal and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> on the elimination of cladribine has not been investigated in humans.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES:</h1>
<p class="First">Two single-center open label studies of cladribine injection have been conducted in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4038845" conceptname="Hairy cell leukemia">Hairy Cell Leukemia</span> with evidence of active disease requiring therapy.Â  In the study conducted at the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation (Study A), 89 patients were treated with a single course of cladribine injection given by continuous intravenous infusion for seven days at a dose of 0.09 mg/kg/day.Â  In the study conducted at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (Study B), 35 patients were treated with a seven-day continuous intravenous infusion of cladribine injection at a comparable dose of 3.6 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day.Â  A complete response (CR) required clearing of the peripheral blood and bone marrow of hairy cells and recovery of the hemoglobin to 12 g/dL, platelet count to 100 x 10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L, and absolute neutrophil count to 1500 x 10<span class="Sup">6</span>/L.Â  A good partial response (GPR) required the same hematologic parameters as a complete response, and that fewer than 5% hairy cells remain in the bone marrow.Â  A partial response (PR) required that hairy cells in the bone marrow be decreased by at least 50% from baseline and the same response for hematologic parameters as for complete response.Â  A pathologic relapse was defined as an increase in bone marrow hairy cells to 25% of pretreatment levels.Â  A clinical relapse was defined as the recurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4179922" conceptname="Cytopenia">cytopenias</span>, specifically, decreases in hemoglobin â‰¥ 2 g/dL, ANC â‰¥ 25% or platelet counts â‰¥ 50,000.Â  Patients who met the criteria for a complete response but subsequently were found to have evidence of bone marrow hairy cells (&lt; 25% of pretreatment levels) were reclassified as partial responses and were not considered to be complete responses with relapse.</p>
<br><p>Among patients evaluable for efficacy (N=106), using the hematologic and bone marrow response criteria described above, the complete response rates in patients treated with cladribine injection were 65% and 68% for Study A and Study B, respectively, yielding a combined complete response rate of 66%.Â  Overall response rates (i.e., Complete plus Good Partial plus Partial Responses) were 89% and 86% in Study A and Study B, respectively, for a combined overall response rate of 88% in evaluable patients treated with cladribine injection.</p>
<br><p>Using an intent-to-treat analysis (N=123) and further requiring no evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200527" conceptname="Splenomegaly">splenomegaly</span> as a criterion for CR (i.e., no palpable spleen on physical examination and â‰¤ 13 cm on CT scan), the complete response rates for Study A and Study B were 54% and 53%, respectively, giving a combined CR rate of 54%.Â  The overall response rates (CR + GPR + PR) were 90% and 85%, for Studies A and B, respectively, yielding a combined overall response rate of 89%.</p>

<p>In these studies, 60% of the patients had not received prior chemotherapy for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4038845" conceptname="Hairy cell leukemia">Hairy Cell Leukemia</span> or had undergone splenectomy as the only prior treatment and were receiving cladribine injection as a first-line treatment.Â  The remaining 40% of the patients received cladribine injection as a second-line treatment, having been treated previously with other agents, including Î±-interferon and/or deoxycoformycin.Â  The overall response rate for patients without prior chemotherapy was 92%, compared with 84% for previously treated patients.Â  Cladribine injection is active in previously treated patients; however, retrospective analysis suggests that the overall response rate is decreased in patients previously treated with splenectomy or deoxycoformycin and in patients refractory to Î±-interferon. </p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Cladribine injection is a potent antineoplastic agent with potentially significant toxic side effects.Â  It should be administered only under the supervision of a physician experienced with the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents.Â  Patients undergoing therapy should be closely observed for signs of hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity.Â  Periodic assessment of peripheral blood counts, particularly during the first four to eight weeks posttreatment, is recommended to detect the development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span> and for early detection of any potential sequelae (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>).Â  As with other potent chemotherapeutic agents, monitoring of renal and hepatic function is also recommended, especially in patients with underlying kidney or liver dysfunction (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#a7280233-b7e8-40bc-b643-0d59160c3dc1">WARNINGS</a></span>Â and <span class="Bold"><a href="#b627bfc1-6345-4380-90ae-84f11065e07d">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span>).</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">Fever</span> was a frequently observed side effect during the first month on study.Â  Since the majority of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fevers</span> occurred in neutropenic patients, patients should be closely monitored during the first month of treatment and empiric antibiotics should be initiated as clinically indicated.Â  Although 69% of patients developed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fevers</span>, less than 1/3 of febrile events were associated with documented <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>.Â  Given the known myelosuppressive effects of cladribine, practitioners should carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of administering this drug to patients with active <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#a7280233-b7e8-40bc-b643-0d59160c3dc1">WARNINGS</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#b627bfc1-6345-4380-90ae-84f11065e07d">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span>).</p>
<p>There are inadequate data on dosing of patients with renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic insufficiency</span>.Â  Development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal insufficiency</span> in some patients receiving high doses of cladribine has been described.Â  Until more information is available, caution is advised when administering the drug to patients with known or suspected renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic insufficiency</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#a7280233-b7e8-40bc-b643-0d59160c3dc1">WARNINGS</a></span>).</p>
<p>Rare cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079687" conceptname="Tumor lysis syndrome">tumor lysis syndrome</span> have been reported in patients treated with cladribine with other hematologic malignancies having a high tumor burden.</p>

<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">During and following treatment, the patientâ€™s hematologic profile should be monitored regularly to determine the degree of hematopoietic suppression.Â  In the clinical studies, following reversible declines in all cell counts, the mean Platelet Count reached 100 x 10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L by Day 12, the mean Absolute Neutrophil Count reached 1500 x 10<span class="Sup">6</span>/L by Week 5 and the mean Hemoglobin reached 12 g/dL by Week 8.Â  After peripheral counts have normalized, bone marrow <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span> and biopsy should be performed to confirm response to treatment with cladribine.Â  Febrile events should be investigated with appropriate laboratory and radiologic studies.Â  Periodic assessment of renal function and hepatic function should be performed as clinically indicated.</p>

<h2>Mutagenesis</h2>
<p class="First">As expected for compounds in this class, the actions of cladribine yield DNA damage.Â  In mammalian cells in culture, cladribine caused the accumulation of DNA strand breaks.Â  Cladribine was also incorporated into DNA of human lymphoblastic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315497" conceptname="Subacute leukemia">leukemia</span> cells.Â  Cladribine was not mutagenic <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">in vitro</span></span> (Ames and Chinese hamster ovary cell gene mutation tests) and did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis in primary rat hepatocyte cultures.Â  However, cladribine was clastogenic both <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">in vitro</span></span> (chromosome aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells) and <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">in vivo</span></span> (mouse bone marrow micronucleus test).</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk.Â  Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from cladribine, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug for the mother.</p>

<br><p>During the first month, 54 of 196 patients (28%) exhibited documented evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>.Â  Serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="132797" conceptname="Sepsis">septicemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255848" conceptname="Pneumonia">pneumonia</span>) were reported in 6% of all patients; the remainder were mild or moderate.Â  Several <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> were attributable to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> and/or complications related to the underlying disease.Â  During the second month, the overall rate of documented <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> was 6%; these <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> were mild to moderate and no severe systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> were seen.Â  After the third month, the monthly incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> was either less than or equal to that of the months immediately preceding cladribine therapy.</p>
<br><p>During the first month, 11% of patients experienced severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span> (i.e., â‰¥ 104Â°F).Â  Documented <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> were noted in fewer than one-third of febrile episodes.Â  Of the 196 patients studied, 19 were noted to have a documented <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> in the month prior to treatment.Â  In the month following treatment, there were 54 episodes of documented <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>: 23 (42%) were bacterial, 11 (20%) were viral and 11 (20%) were fungal.Â  Seven (7) of 8 documented episodes of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443943" conceptname="Herpes zoster">herpes zoster</span> occurred during the month following treatment.Â  Fourteen (14) of 16 episodes of documented <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432248" conceptname="Opportunistic mycosis">fungal infections</span> occurred in the first two months following treatment.Â  Virtually all of these patients were treated empirically with antibiotics (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#a7280233-b7e8-40bc-b643-0d59160c3dc1">WARNINGS</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#c03953fa-1587-48b0-8b37-1a2d9b6ef20c">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>).</p>
<br><p>Analysis of lymphocyte subsets indicates that treatment with cladribine is associated with prolonged <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> of the CD4 counts.Â  Prior to treatment, the mean CD4 count was 766/Î¼L.Â  The mean CD4 count nadir, which occurred four to six months following treatment, was 272/Î¼L.Â  Fifteen (15) months after treatment, mean CD4 counts remained below 500/Î¼L.Â  CD8 counts behaved similarly, though increasing counts were observed after nine months.Â  The clinical significance of the prolonged CD4 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441541" conceptname="Lymphocytopenia">lymphopenia</span> is unclear.</p>
