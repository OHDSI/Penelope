<h2><span class="Bold">Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide</span></h2>
<p class="First">As a result of its <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuretic effects</span>, hydrochlorothiazide increases plasma renin activity, increases aldosterone secretion, and decreases serum potassium.  Administration of lisinopril blocks the renin-angiotensin aldosterone axis and tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with the diuretic.</p>
<p>In clinical studies, the extent of blood pressure reduction seen with the combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide was approximately additive.  The ZESTORETIC 10-12.5 combination worked equally well in black and white patients.  The ZESTORETIC 20-12.5 and ZESTORETIC 20-25 combinations appeared somewhat less effective in black patients, but relatively few black patients were studied.  In most patients, the antihypertensive effect of ZESTORETIC was sustained for at least 24 hours.</p>
<p>In a randomized, controlled comparison, the mean antihypertensive effects of ZESTORETIC 20-12.5 and ZESTORETIC 20-25 were similar, suggesting that many patients who respond adequately to the latter combination may be controlled with ZESTORETIC 20-12.5  (See <a href="#_ed93b466-4502-afc7-838b-522d918f2906">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide has little or no effect on the bioavailability of either drug.  The combination tablet is bioequivalent to concomitant administration of the separate entities.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Lisinopril</span></h2>
<p class="First">Mechanism of Action</p>
<p>Lisinopril inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and animals.  ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II.  Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex.  Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion.  The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium.  Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity.  In hypertensive patients with normal renal function treated with lisinopril alone for up to 24 weeks, the mean increase in serum potassium was less than 0.1 mEq/L; however, approximately 15 percent of patients had increases greater than 0.5 mEq/L and approximately six percent had a decrease greater than 0.5 mEq/L.  In the same study, patients treated with lisinopril plus a thiazide diuretic showed essentially no change in serum potassium  (See <a href="#PRECAUTIONS">PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>
<p>ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin.  Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of lisinopril remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>While the mechanism through which lisinopril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, lisinopril is antihypertensive even in patients with low-renin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>.  Although lisinopril was antihypertensive in all races studied, black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to lisinopril monotherapy than nonblack patients.</p>
<p>Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism:</p>
<p>Following oral administration of lisinopril, peak serum concentrations occur within about 7 hours.  Declining serum concentrations exhibit a prolonged terminal phase which does not contribute to drug accumulation.  This terminal phase probably represents saturable binding to ACE and is not proportional to dose.  Lisinopril does not appear to be bound to other serum proteins.</p>
<p>Lisinopril does not undergo metabolism and is excreted unchanged entirely in the urine. Based on urinary recovery, the mean extent of absorption of lisinopril is approximately 25 percent, with large intersubject variability (6%-60%) at all doses tested (5-80 mg).  Lisinopril absorption is not influenced by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
<p>Upon multiple dosing, lisinopril exhibits an effective half-life of accumulation of 12 hours.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Impaired renal function</span> decreases elimination of lisinopril, which is excreted principally through the kidneys, but this decrease becomes clinically important only when the glomerular filtration rate is below 30 mL/min.  Above this glomerular filtration rate, the elimination half-life is little changed.  With greater impairment, however, peak and trough lisinopril levels increase, time to peak concentration increases and time to attain steady state is prolonged. Older patients, on average, have (approximately doubled) higher blood levels and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) than younger patients (see <a href="#_ed93b466-4502-afc7-838b-522d918f2906">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).  In a multiple dose pharmacokinetic study in elderly versus young hypertensive patients using the lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide combination, the AUC increased approximately 120% for lisinopril and approximately 80% for hydrochlorothiazide in older patients. Lisinopril can be removed by hemodialysis.</p>
<p>Studies in rats indicate that lisinopril crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly.  Multiple doses of lisinopril in rats do not result in accumulation in any tissues; however, milk of lactating rats contains radioactivity following administration of <span class="Sup">14</span>C lisinopril.  By whole body autoradiography, radioactivity was found in the placenta following administration of labeled drug to pregnant rats, but none was found in the fetuses.</p>
<p>Pharmacodynamics:</p>
<p>Administration of lisinopril to patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> results in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>.  Symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span> is usually not observed although it can occur and should be anticipated in volume and/or salt-depleted patients  (See <a href="#WARNINGS">WARNINGS</a>).</p>
<p>In most patients studied, onset of antihypertensive activity was seen at one hour after oral administration of an individual dose of lisinopril, with peak reduction of blood pressure achieved by six hours.</p>
<p>In some patients achievement of optimal blood pressure reduction may require two to four weeks of therapy.</p>
<p>At recommended single daily doses, antihypertensive effects have been maintained for at least 24 hours, after dosing, although the effect at 24 hours was substantially smaller than the effect six hours after dosing.</p>
<p>The antihypertensive effects of lisinopril have continued during long-term therapy.  Abrupt withdrawal of lisinopril has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure; nor with a significant overshoot of pretreatment blood pressure.</p>
<p>In hemodynamic studies in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320128" conceptname="Essential hypertension">essential hypertension</span>, blood pressure reduction was accompanied by a reduction in peripheral arterial resistance with little or no change in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span> and in heart rate.  In a study in nine hypertensive patients, following administration of lisinopril, there was an increase in mean renal blood flow that was not significant.  Data from several small studies are inconsistent with respect to the effect of lisinopril on glomerular filtration rate in hypertensive patients with normal renal function, but suggest that changes, if any, are not large.</p>
<p>In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317895" conceptname="Renovascular hypertension">renovascular hypertension</span> lisinopril has been shown to be well tolerated and effective in controlling blood pressure (See <a href="#PRECAUTIONS">PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Hydrochlorothiazide</span></h2>
<p class="First">The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown.  Thiazides do not usually affect normal blood pressure.</p>
<p>Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic and antihypertensive.  It affects the distal renal tubular mechanism of electrolyte reabsorption.  Hydrochlorothiazide increases excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts.  Natriuresis may be accompanied by some loss of potassium and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span>.</p>
<p>After oral use <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span> begins within two hours, peaks in about four hours and lasts about 6 to 12 hours.</p>
<p>Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidney.  When plasma levels have been followed for at least 24 hours, the plasma half-life has been observed to vary between 5.6 and 14.8 hours.  At least 61 percent of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours.  Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placental but not the blood-brain barrier.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</span></h1>
<p class="First">ZESTORETIC is indicated for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, to lower blood pressure.  Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">strokes</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarctions</span>.  These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide.</p>
<p>Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).</p>
<p>Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits.  The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, but reductions in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.</p>
<p>Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> can provide substantial benefit.  Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> (for example, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432867" conceptname="Hyperlipidemia">hyperlipidemia</span>), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.</p>
<p>Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (eg, on angina, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.</p>
<p>These fixed-dose combinations are not indicated for initial therapy (see <a href="#_ed93b466-4502-afc7-838b-522d918f2906">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>
<p>In using ZESTORETIC, consideration should be given to the fact that an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440689" conceptname="Agranulocytosis">agranulocytosis</span>, particularly in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> or collagen vascular disease, and that available data are insufficient to show that lisinopril does not have a similar risk (See <a href="#WARNINGS">WARNINGS</a>).</p>
<p>In considering the use of ZESTORETIC, it should be noted that ACE inhibitors have been associated with a higher rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432791" conceptname="Angioedema">angioedema</span> in black than in nonblack patients (see <a href="#_ac46ff5e-873b-a921-4122-5a028ab7c45f">WARNINGS, Lisinopril</a>).</p>

Resulting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations.

When pregnancy is detected, discontinue ZESTORETIC as soon as possible.  These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy.  Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to  antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents.  Appropriate management of maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus.</p>
<p>In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> is observed, discontinue ZESTORETIC, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother.

Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury.

<p><span class="Bold">Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors):</span> In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised  renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including lisinopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span>.  These effects are usually reversible.  Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving lisinopril and NSAID therapy.</p>
<p>The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including lisinopril, may be attenuated by NSAIDs.</p>

<p>In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors, closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on ZESTORETIC and other agents that affect the RAS.</p>
<p>Do not co-administer aliskiren with ZESTORETIC in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>.  Avoid use of aliskiren with ZESTORETIC in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (GFR &lt; 60 ml/min).</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span></h1>
<p class="First">Lisinopril monotherapy is an effective treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> in once-daily doses of 10-80 mg, while hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy is effective in doses of 12.5 - 50 mg per day.  In clinical trials of lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using lisinopril doses of 10-80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25-50 mg, the antihypertensive response rates generally increased with increasing dose of either component.</p>
<p>The side effects (see <a href="#WARNINGS">WARNINGS</a>) of lisinopril are generally rare and apparently independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>) and dose-independent phenomena (eg, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192640" conceptname="Pancreatitis">pancreatitis</span>), the former much more common than the latter.  Therapy with any combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide may be associated with either or both dose-independent or dose-dependent side effects, but addition of lisinopril in clinical trials blunted the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span> normally seen with diuretics.</p>
<p>To minimize dose-dependent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Dose Titration Guided by Clinical Effect: </span> A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with either lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy may be switched to lisinopril/HCTZ 10/12.5 or lisinopril/HCTZ 20/12.5, depending on current monotherapy dose.  Further increases of either or both components should depend on clinical response with blood pressure measured at the interdosing interval to ensure that there is an adequate antihypertensive effect at that time.  The hydrochlorothiazide dose should generally not be increased until 2-3 weeks have elapsed.  After addition of the diuretic it may be possible to reduce the dose of lisinopril.  Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 25 mg of daily hydrochlorothiazide, but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen may achieve similar or greater blood-pressure control without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022093" conceptname="Electrolyte imbalance">electrolyte disturbance</span> if they are switched to lisinopril/HCTZ 10/12.5.</p>
<p>In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> occasionally may occur following the initial dose of lisinopril.  The diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued for two to three days before beginning therapy with lisinopril to reduce the likelihood of hypotension  (See <a href="http://npi-nor-vs-ldbp:8080/labelbridge-1.5/editText.do?lb_id=13&amp;mode=doctree#_Refwherry1133202968372">WARNINGS</a>).  If the patient's blood pressure is not controlled with lisinopril alone, diuretic therapy may be resumed. </p>
<p>If the diuretic cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 5 mg of lisinopril should be used under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour (See <a href="#WARNINGS">WARNINGS </a>and <a href="#_bb9823e0-3ab4-003e-248a-95ab90578d52">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</a>). </p>
<p>Concomitant administration of ZESTORETIC with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes or potassium-sparing diuretics may lead to increases of serum potassium (See <a href="#PRECAUTIONS">PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>
