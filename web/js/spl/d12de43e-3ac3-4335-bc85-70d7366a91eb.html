<h2><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action:</span></h2>
<p class="First">The precise mechanism(s) by which zonisamide exerts its antiseizure effect is unknown. Zonisamide demonstrated anticonvulsant activity in several experimental models. In animals, zonisamide was effective against tonic extension <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> induced by maximal electroshock but ineffective against <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4265182" conceptname="Clonic seizure">clonic seizures</span> induced by subcutaneous pentylenetetrazol. Zonisamide raised the threshold for generalized <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> in the kindled rat model and reduced the duration of cortical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106574" conceptname="Partial seizure">focal seizures</span> induced by electrical stimulation of the visual cortex in cats. Furthermore, zonisamide suppressed both interictal spikes and the secondarily generalized <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> produced by cortical application of tungstic acid gel in rats or by cortical freezing in cats. The relevance of these models to human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> is unknown.</p>
<p>Zonisamide may produce these effects through action at sodium and calcium channels. In vitro pharmacological studies suggest that zonisamide blocks sodium channels and reduces voltage-dependent, transient inward currents (T-type Ca<span class="Sup">2+</span> currents), consequently stabilizing neuronal membranes and suppressing neuronal hypersynchronization. In vitro binding studies have demonstrated that zonisamide binds to the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor ionophore complex in an allosteric fashion which does not produce changes in chloride flux. Other in vitro studies have demonstrated that zonisamide (10–30 µg/mL) suppresses synaptically-driven electrical activity without affecting postsynaptic GABA or glutamate responses (cultured mouse spinal cord neurons) or neuronal or glial uptake of [<span class="Sup">3</span>H]-GABA (rat hippocampal slices). Thus, zonisamide does not appear to potentiate the synaptic activity of GABA. In vivo microdialysis studies demonstrated that zonisamide facilitates both dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission.</p>
<p>Zonisamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. The contribution of this pharmacological action to the therapeutic effects of zonisamide is unknown. However, as a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, zonisamide may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_4372e117-5cbe-4253-a820-f793165a6c10">WARNINGS, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">Metabolic Acidosis</span></a></span> subsection).</p>

<h2>Absorption</h2>
<p class="First">Following a 200–400 mg oral zonisamide dose, peak plasma concentrations (range: 2–5 µg/mL) in normal volunteers occur within 2–6 hours. In the presence of food, the time to maximum concentration is delayed, occurring at 4–6 hours, but food has no effect on the bioavailability of zonisamide. Zonisamide absorption is dose-proportional in the range of 200-400 mg. Cmax and AUC, however, increase disproportionately at 800 mg, possibly due to saturable binding of zonisamide to red blood cells. Once a stable dose is reached, steady state is achieved within 14 days.</p>

<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p class="First">The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of zonisamide is about 1.45 L/kg following a 400 mg oral dose. Zonisamide, at concentrations of 1.0–7.0 µg/mL, is approximately 40% bound to human plasma proteins. Zonisamide extensively binds to erythrocytes, resulting in an eight-fold higher concentration of zonisamide in red blood cells than in plasma. Protein binding of zonisamide is unaffected in the presence of therapeutic concentrations of phenytoin, phenobarbital or carbamazepine.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Metabolism and Elimination</span></h2>
<p class="First">Following oral administration of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-zonisamide to healthy volunteers, only zonisamide was detected in plasma. Zonisamide is excreted primarily in urine as parent drug and as the glucuronide of a metabolite. Following multiple dosing, 62% of the radiolabeled dose was recovered in the urine, with 3% in the feces by day 10. Zonisamide undergoes acetylation by N-acetyl-transferases to form N-acetyl zonisamide and reduction to form the open ring metabolite, 2–sulfamoylacetyl phenol (SMAP). Of the excreted dose, 35% was recovered as zonisamide, 15% as N-acetyl zonisamide, and 50% as the glucuronide of SMAP. Reduction of zonisamide to SMAP is mediated by cytochrome P450 isozyme 3A4 (CYP3A4). Zonisamide does not induce its own metabolism. The plasma clearance of oral zonisamide is approximately 0.30–0.35 mL/min/kg in patients not receiving enzyme-inducing antiepilepsy drugs (AEDs). The clearance of zonisamide is increased to 0.5 mL/min/kg in patients concurrently on enzyme-inducing AEDs.</p>
<p>After a single-dose administration, renal clearance of zonisamide is approximately 3.5 mL/min. The clearance of an oral dose of zonisamide from red blood cells is 2 mL/min. The elimination half-life of zonisamide in plasma is approximately 63 hours. The elimination half-life of zonisamide in red blood cells is approximately 105 hours.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Specific Populations:</span></h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal Impairment</span>:</span> Single 300 mg zonisamide doses were administered to three groups of volunteers. Group 1 was a healthy group with a creatinine clearance ranging from 70–152 mL/min. Group 2 and Group 3 had creatinine clearances ranging from 14.5–59 mL/min and 10–20 mL/min, respectively. Zonisamide <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437992" conceptname="Renal function tests abnormal">renal clearance decreased</span> with decreasing renal function (3.42, 2.50, 2.23 mL/min, respectively). Marked <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (creatinine clearance &lt; 20 mL/min) was associated with an increase in zonisamide AUC of 35% (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_a74b7fb2-de9c-410b-8530-e182abd302ea">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span> section).</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic Impairment</span>:</span> The pharmacokinetics of zonisamide in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4326594" conceptname="Abnormal liver function">impaired liver function</span> have not been studied (see <a href="#LINK_a74b7fb2-de9c-410b-8530-e182abd302ea">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a> section).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Age:</span> The pharmacokinetics of a 300 mg single dose of zonisamide was similar in young (mean age 28 years) and elderly subjects (mean age 69 years).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Gender and Race:</span> Information on the effect of gender and race on the pharmacokinetics of zonisamide is not available.</p>
<p><span class="Underline"><span class="Bold">Effects of ZONEGRAN on cytochrome P450 enzymes</span></span></p>
<p>In vitro studies using human liver microsomes show insignificant (&lt;25%) inhibition of cytochrome P450 isozymes 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4, 2B6 or 2C8 at zonisamide levels approximately two-fold or greater than clinically relevant unbound serum concentrations. Therefore, ZONEGRAN is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of other drugs via cytochrome P450-mediated mechanisms.</p>
<p><span class="Underline"><span class="Bold">Potential for ZONEGRAN to affect other drugs</span></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Anti-epileptic drugs</span></p>
<p>In epileptic patients, steady-state dosing with ZONEGRAN resulted in no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic effects on carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin, or sodium valproate.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Oral contraceptives</span></p>
<p>In healthy subjects, steady state dosing with ZONEGRAN did not affect serum concentrations of ethinylestradiol or norethisterone in a combined oral contraceptive.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">CYP2D6 substrates</span></p>
<p>Coadministration of multiple dosing of zonisamide up to 400 mg/day with single 50-mg doses of desipramine did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetic parameters of desipramine, a probe drug for CYP2D6 activity.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">P-gp substrate</span></p>
<p>An in vitro study showed that zonisamide is a weak inhibitor of P-gp (MDR1) with an IC<span class="Sub">50</span> of 267 µmol/L. There is a theoretical potential for zonisamide to affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs which are P-gp substrates.</p>
<p>Caution is advised when starting or stopping ZONEGRAN or changing the ZONEGRAN dose in patients who are also receiving drugs which are P-gp substrates (e.g., digoxin, quinidine)</p>
<p><span class="Underline"><span class="Bold">Potential for Medicinal Product to Affect ZONEGRAN</span></span></p>
<p>Concomitant medications that can induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or N-acetyl-transferases may affect the pharmacokinetics of zonisamide. Drugs which inhibit or induce glucuronide conjugation are not expected to influence the pharmacokinetics of zonisamide.</p>
<p>The absence of a clinically significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interaction</span> between zonisamide and lamotrigine indicates a low potential for zonisamide to interact with substances which are metabolized by UDP-GT.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">CYP3A4 Induction:</span> Drugs that induce liver enzymes increase the metabolism and clearance of zonisamide and decrease its half-life. The half-life of zonisamide following a 400 mg dose in patients concurrently on enzyme-inducing AEDs such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, or phenobarbital was between 27-38 hours; the half-life of zonisamide in patients concurrently on the non-enzyme inducing AED, valproate, was 46 hours.</p>
<p>These effects are unlikely to be of clinical significance when ZONEGRAN is added to existing therapy; however, changes in zonisamide concentrations may occur if concomitant CYP3A4 inducing anti-epileptic or other drugs are withdrawn, dose adjusted or introduced, an adjustment of the ZONEGRAN dose may be required. If co-administration with a potent CYP3A4 inducer (e.g., rifampicin) is necessary, the patient should be closely monitored and the dose of ZONEGRAN and other drugs that are CYP3A4 substrate may need to be adjusted.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">CYP3A4 Inhibition:</span> Steady-state dosing of either ketoconazole (400 mg/day) or cimetidine (1200 mg/day) had no clinically relevant effects on the single dose pharmacokinetics of zonisamide given to healthy subjects. Therefore, modification of ZONEGRAN dosing is not necessary when co-administered with known CYP3A4 inhibitors.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Interactions of Zonisamide with Other Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors</span>: </p>
<p>Concomitant use of ZONEGRAN, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, with any other carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (e.g., topiramate, acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide), may increase the severity of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span> and may also increase the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201620" conceptname="Kidney stone">kidney stone</span> formation. Therefore, if ZONEGRAN is given concomitantly with another carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, the patient should be monitored for the appearance or worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_9927967c-8828-4216-8d99-4fa48caed09c">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</a></span> subsection).</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Clinical Studies:</span></h2>
<p class="First">The effectiveness of ZONEGRAN as adjunctive therapy (added to other antiepilepsy drugs) has been established in three multicenter, placebo-controlled, double blind, 3-month clinical trials (two domestic, one European) in 499 patients with refractory partial onset <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> with or without secondary generalization. Each patient had a history of at least four partial onset <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> per month in spite of receiving one or two antiepilepsy drugs at therapeutic concentrations. The 499 patients (209 women, 290 men) ranged in age from 13–68 years with a mean age of about 35 years. In the two US studies, over 80% of patients were Caucasian; 100% of patients in the European study were Caucasian. ZONEGRAN or placebo was added to the existing therapy. The primary measure of effectiveness was median percent reduction from baseline in partial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> frequency. The secondary measure was proportion of patients achieving a 50% or greater <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> reduction from baseline (responders). The results described below are for all <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106574" conceptname="Partial seizure">partial seizures</span> in the intent-to-treat populations.</p>
<p>In the first study (n = 203), all patients had a 1-month baseline observation period, then received placebo or ZONEGRAN in one of two dose escalation regimens; either 1) 100 mg/day for five weeks, 200 mg/day for one week, 300 mg/day for one week, and then 400 mg/day for five weeks; or 2) 100 mg/day for one week, followed by 200 mg/day for five weeks, then 300 mg/day for one week, then 400 mg/day for five weeks. This design allowed a 100 mg vs. placebo comparison over weeks 1–5, and a 200 mg vs. placebo comparison over weeks 2–6; the primary comparison was 400 mg (both escalation groups combined) vs. placebo over weeks 8–12. The total daily dose was given as twice a day dosing. Statistically significant treatment differences favoring ZONEGRAN were seen for doses of 100, 200, and 400 mg/day.</p>
<p>In the second (n = 152) and third (n = 138) studies, patients had a 2–3 month baseline, then were randomly assigned to placebo or ZONEGRAN for three months. ZONEGRAN was introduced by administering 100 mg/day for the first week, 200 mg/day the second week, then 400 mg/day for two weeks, after which the dose (ZONEGRAN or placebo) could be adjusted as necessary to a maximum dose of 20 mg/kg/day or a maximum plasma level of 40 µg/mL. In the second study, the total daily dose was given as twice a day dosing; in the third study, it was given as a single daily dose. The average final maintenance doses received in the studies were 530 and 430 mg/day in the second and third studies, respectively. Both studies demonstrated statistically significant differences favoring ZONEGRAN for doses of 400–600 mg/day, and there was no apparent difference between once daily and twice daily dosing (in different studies). Analysis of the data (first 4 weeks) during titration demonstrated statistically significant differences favoring ZONEGRAN at doses between 100 and 400 mg/day. The primary comparison in both trials was for any dose over Weeks 5–12.</p>

A positive value on the Y-axis indicates an improvement from baseline (i.e., a decrease in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> rate), while a negative value indicates a worsening from baseline (i.e., an increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> rate). Thus, in a display of this type, the curve for an effective treatment is shifted to the left of the curve for placebo. The proportion of patients achieving any particular level of reduction in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> rate was consistently higher for the ZONEGRAN groups compared to the placebo groups. For example, Figure 1 indicates that approximately 27% of patients treated with ZONEGRAN experienced a 75% or greater reduction, compared to approximately 12% in the placebo groups.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322252" conceptname="Suicidal behavior">Suicidal Behavior</span> and Ideation</span></h2>
<p class="First">Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including ZONEGRAN, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</p>
<p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322252" conceptname="Suicidal behavior">suicidal behavior</span> or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>.</p>
<p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</p>
<p>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201620" conceptname="Kidney stone">Kidney Stones</span>:</span></h2>
<p class="First">Among 991 patients treated during the development of ZONEGRAN, 40 patients (4.0%) with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> receiving ZONEGRAN developed clinically possible or confirmed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201620" conceptname="Kidney stone">kidney stones</span> (e.g. clinical symptomatology, sonography, etc.), a rate of 34 per 1000 patient-years of exposure (40 patients with 1168 years of exposure). Of these, 12 were symptomatic, and 28 were described as possible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201620" conceptname="Kidney stone">kidney stones</span> based on sonographic detection. In nine patients, the diagnosis was confirmed by a passage of a stone or by a definitive sonographic finding. The rate of occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201620" conceptname="Kidney stone">kidney stones</span> was 28.7 per 1000 patient-years of exposure in the first six months, 62.6 per 1000 patient-years of exposure between 6 and 12 months, and 24.3 per 1000 patient-years of exposure after 12 months of use. There are no normative sonographic data available for either the general population or patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>. Although the clinical significance of the sonographic findings may not be certain, the development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201620" conceptname="Kidney stone">nephrolithiasis</span> may be related to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_4372e117-5cbe-4253-a820-f793165a6c10">WARNINGS, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">Metabolic Acidosis</span></a></span> subsection). The analyzed stones were composed of calcium or urate salts. In general, increasing fluid intake and urine output can help reduce the risk of stone formation, particularly in those with predisposing risk factors. It is unknown, however, whether these measures will reduce the risk of stone formation in patients treated with ZONEGRAN.</p>
<p>Although not approved in pediatric patients, sonographic findings consistent with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201620" conceptname="Kidney stone">nephrolithiasis</span> were also detected in 8% of a subset of ZONEGRAN-treated pediatric patients who had at least one renal ultrasound prospectively performed in a clinical development program investigating open-label treatment.

<h2><span class="Bold">Effect on Renal Function:</span></h2>
<p class="First">In several clinical studies, zonisamide was associated with a statistically significant 8% mean increase from baseline of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) compared to essentially no change in the placebo patients. The increase appeared to persist over time but was not progressive; this has been interpreted as an effect on glomerular filtration rate (GFR). There were no episodes of unexplained <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span> in clinical development in the US, Europe, or Japan. The decrease in GFR appeared within the first 4 weeks of treatment. In a 30-day study, the GFR returned to baseline within 2–3 weeks of drug discontinuation. There is no information about reversibility, after drug discontinuation, of the effects on GFR after long-term use. ZONEGRAN should be discontinued in patients who develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span> or a clinically significant sustained increase in the creatinine/BUN concentration. ZONEGRAN should not be used in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> (estimated GFR &lt; 50 mL/min) as there has been insufficient experience concerning drug dosing and toxicity.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Carcinogenicity, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:</span></h2>
<p class="First">No evidence of carcinogenicity was found in mice or rats following dietary administration of zonisamide for two years at doses of up to 80 mg/kg/day. In mice, this dose is approximately equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 400 mg/day on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. In rats, this dose is 1–2 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p>
<p>Zonisamide was mutagenic in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in CHL cells. Zonisamide was not mutagenic or clastogenic in other in vitro assays (Ames, mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> tk assay, chromosomal aberration in human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span>) or in the in vivo rat bone marrow cytogenetics assay.</p>
<p>Rats treated with zonisamide (20, 60, or 200 mg/kg) before mating and during the initial gestation phase showed signs of reproductive toxicity (decreased corpora lutea, implantations, and live fetuses) at all doses. The low dose in this study is approximately 0.5 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p>

<p>Zonisamide may cause serious adverse fetal effects, based on clinical and nonclinical data. Zonisamide was teratogenic in multiple animal species.</p>

Pregnant patients should be monitored for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span> and treated as in the non-pregnant state. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_4372e117-5cbe-4253-a820-f793165a6c10">WARNINGS, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">Metabolic Acidosis</span></a></span> subsection.)</p>
<p>Newborns of mothers treated with zonisamide should be monitored for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span> because of transfer of zonisamide to the fetus and possible occurrence of transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span> following birth. Transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span> has been reported in neonates born to mothers treated during pregnancy with a different carbonic anhydrase inhibitor.</p>
<p>Zonisamide was teratogenic in mice, rats, and dogs and embryolethal in monkeys when administered during the period of organogenesis. Fetal abnormalities or embryo-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079844" conceptname="Fetal death">fetal deaths</span> occurred in these species at zonisamide dosage and maternal plasma levels similar to or lower than therapeutic levels in humans, indicating that use of this drug in pregnancy entails a significant risk to the fetus. A variety of external, visceral, and skeletal malformations was produced in animals by prenatal exposure to zonisamide. Cardiovascular defects were prominent in both rats and dogs.</p>
<p>Following administration of zonisamide (10, 30, or 60 mg/kg/day) to pregnant dogs during organogenesis, increased incidences of fetal cardiovascular malformations (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434462" conceptname="Ventricular septal defect">ventricular septal defects</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314658" conceptname="Cardiomegaly">cardiomegaly</span>, various valvular and arterial anomalies) were found at doses of 30 mg/kg/day or greater. The low effect dose for malformations produced peak maternal plasma zonisamide levels (25 μg/mL) about 0.5 times the highest plasma levels measured in patients receiving the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 400 mg/day. In dogs, cardiovascular malformations were found in approximately 50% of all fetuses exposed to the high dose, which was associated with maternal plasma levels (44 μg/mL) approximately equal to the highest levels measured in humans receiving the MRHD. Incidences of skeletal malformations were also increased at the high dose, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80204" conceptname="Fetal growth restriction">fetal growth retardation</span> and increased frequencies of skeletal variations were seen at all doses in this study. The low dose produced maternal plasma levels (12 μg/mL) about 0.25 times the highest human levels.</p>
<p>In cynomolgus monkeys, administration of zonisamide (10 or 20 mg/kg/day) to pregnant animals during organogenesis resulted in embryo-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079844" conceptname="Fetal death">fetal deaths</span> at both doses. The possibility that these <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> were due to malformations cannot be ruled out. The lowest embryolethal dose in monkeys was associated with peak maternal plasma zonisamide levels (5 μg/mL) approximately 0.1 times the highest levels measured in patients at the MRHD.</p>
<p>In a mouse embryo-fetal development study, treatment of pregnant animals with zonisamide (125, 250, or 500 mg/kg/day) during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079975" conceptname="Congenital malformation">fetal malformations</span> (skeletal and/or craniofacial defects) at all doses tested. The low dose in this study is approximately 1.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. In rats, increased frequencies of malformations (cardiovascular defects) and variations (persistent cords of thymic tissue, decreased skeletal ossification) were observed among the offspring of dams treated with zonisamide (20, 60, or 200 mg/kg/day) throughout organogenesis at all doses. The low effect dose is approximately 0.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p>
<p>Perinatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> was increased among the offspring of rats treated with zonisamide (10, 30, or 60 mg/kg/day) from the latter part of gestation up to weaning at the high dose, or approximately 1.4 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. The no effect level of 30 mg/kg/day is approximately 0.7 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. ZONEGRAN should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<p>To provide information regarding the effects of in utero exposure to ZONEGRAN, physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking ZONEGRAN enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Geriatric Use:</span></h2>
<p class="First">Single dose pharmacokinetic parameters are similar in elderly and young healthy volunteers (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_24f92643-91eb-447f-a124-50ba66999741">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Special Populations</a></span> subsection). Clinical studies of zonisamide did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Management:</span></h2>
<p class="First">No specific antidotes for ZONEGRAN overdosage are available. Following a suspected recent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> should be induced or gastric lavage performed with the usual precautions to protect the airway. General supportive care is indicated, including frequent monitoring of vital signs and close observation.</p>
<p>Zonisamide has a long half-life (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_239d72a4-9ad0-48ec-85c2-08cbf7641029">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span> section). Due to the low protein binding of zonisamide (40%), renal dialysis may be effective. The effectiveness of renal dialysis as a treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> has not been formally studied. A poison control center should be contacted for information on the management of ZONEGRAN overdosage.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span></h1>
<p class="First">ZONEGRAN (zonisamide) is recommended as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106574" conceptname="Partial seizure">partial seizures</span> in adults. Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients below the age of 16 have not been established. ZONEGRAN should be administered once or twice daily, using 25 mg or 100 mg capsules. ZONEGRAN is given orally and can be taken with or without food. Capsules should be swallowed whole.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">

<h2><span class="Bold">Adults over Age 16:</span></h2>
<p class="First">The prescriber should be aware that, because of the long half-life of zonisamide, up to two weeks may be required to achieve steady state levels upon reaching a stable dose or following dosage adjustment. Although the regimen described below is one that has been shown to be tolerated, the prescriber may wish to prolong the duration of treatment at the lower doses in order to fully assess the effects of zonisamide at steady state, noting that many of the side effects of zonisamide are more frequent at doses of 300 mg per day and above. Although there is some evidence of greater response at doses above 100–200 mg/day, the increase appears small and formal dose-response studies have not been conducted.</p>
<p>The initial dose of ZONEGRAN should be 100 mg daily. After two weeks, the dose may be increased to 200 mg/day for at least two weeks. It can be increased to 300 mg/day and 400 mg/day, with the dose stable for at least two weeks to achieve steady state at each level. Evidence from controlled trials suggests that ZONEGRAN doses of 100–600 mg/day are effective, but there is no suggestion of increasing response above 400 mg/day (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_afa32912-48b9-4763-b01a-59bb2fe41af4">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies</a></span> subsection). There is little experience with doses greater than 600 mg/day.</p>
