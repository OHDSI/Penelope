<h1>6  ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<a href="http://"></a>6.1 Clinical Studies Experience<p class="First">The safety profile of ALTABAX was assessed in 2,115 adult and 
pediatric patients ≥9 months who used at least one dose from a 5-day, twice a 
day regimen of retapamulin ointment. Control groups included 819 adult and 
pediatric patients who used at least one dose of the active control (oral 
cephalexin), 172 patients who used an active topical comparator (not available 
in the US), and 71 patients who used placebo.</p>
<p>Adverse events rated by investigators as drug-related occurred in 5.5% 
(116/2,115) of patients treated with retapamulin ointment, 6.6% (54/819) of 
patients receiving cephalexin, and 2.8% (2/71) of patients receiving placebo. 
The most common drug-related adverse events (≥1% of patients) were application 
site irritation (1.4%) in the retapamulin group, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span> (1.7%) in the 
cephalexin group, and application site <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span> (1.4%) and application site 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4193492" conceptname="Acroparesthesia">paresthesia</span> (1.4%) in the placebo group.</p>
<p>Because clinical studies are conducted under varying conditions, adverse 
reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly 
compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect 
the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from the 
clinical studies does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse 
events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.</p>

<h1>7  DRUG INTERACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Co-administration of oral ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily 
increased retapamulin geometric mean AUC<span class="Sub">(0-24)</span> and C<span class="Sub">max </span>by 81% after topical application of retapamulin ointment, 
1% on the abraded skin of healthy adult males. Due to low systemic exposure to 
retapamulin following topical application in patients, dosage adjustments for 
retapamulin are unnecessary when co-administered with CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as 
ketoconazole. Based on in vitro P450 inhibition studies and the low systemic 
exposure observed following topical application of ALTABAX, retapamulin is 
unlikely to affect the metabolism of other P450 substrates.</p>
<p>The effect of concurrent application of ALTABAX and other topical products to 
the same area of skin has not been studied.</p>

<h1>8  USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h1>
<a href="http://"></a>8.1 Pregnancy<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category B</span>. Effects on 
embryo-fetal development were assessed in pregnant rats given 50, 150, or 
450 mg/kg/day by oral gavage on days 6 to 17 postcoitus. Maternal toxicity 
(decreased body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span> and food consumption) and developmental toxicity 
(decreased fetal body weight and delayed skeletal ossification) were evident at 
doses ≥150 mg/kg/day. There were no treatment-related malformations observed in 
fetal rats.</p>
<p>Retapamulin was given as a continuous intravenous infusion to pregnant 
rabbits at dosages of 2.4, 7.2, or 24 mg/kg/day from day 7 to 19 of gestation. 
Maternal toxicity (decreased body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span>, food consumption, and abortions) 
was demonstrated at dosages ≥7.2 mg/kg/day (8-fold the estimated maximum 
achievable human exposure, based on AUC, at 7.2 mg/kg/day). There was no 
treatment-related effect on embryo-fetal development.</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because 
animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, ALTABAX 
should be used in pregnancy only when the potential benefits outweigh the 
potential risk.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>8.3 Nursing Mothers<p>It is not known whether retapamulin is excreted in human milk. 
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when 
ALTABAX is administered to a nursing woman. The safe use of retapamulin during 
breast-feeding has not been established.</p>

<h1>12  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<a href="http://"></a>12.1 Mechanism of Action<p class="First">ALTABAX is an antibacterial agent <span class="Italics">[see 
Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)]</span>.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>12.2 Pharmacodynamics<p>In post-hoc analyses of manually over-read 12-lead ECGs from 
healthy subjects (N = 103), no significant effects on QT/QTc intervals were 
observed after topical application of retapamulin ointment on intact and abraded 
skin. Due to the low systemic exposure to retapamulin with topical application, 
QT prolongation in patients is unlikely <span class="Italics">[see Clinical 
Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>12.3 Pharmacokinetics<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Underline">Absorption</span><p>In a study of healthy adult subjects, retapamulin ointment, 1% 
was applied once daily to intact skin (800 cm<span class="Sup">2</span> surface 
area) and to abraded skin (200 cm<span class="Sup">2 </span>surface area) under 
occlusion for up to 7 days. Systemic exposure following topical application of 
retapamulin through intact and abraded skin was low. Three percent of blood 
samples obtained on Day 1 after topical application to intact skin had 
measurable retapamulin concentrations (lower limit of quantitation 0.5 ng/mL); 
thus C<span class="Sub">max</span> values on Day 1 could not be determined. 
Eighty-two percent of blood samples obtained on Day 7 after topical application 
to intact skin and 97% and 100% of blood samples obtained after topical 
application to abraded skin on Days 1 and 7, respectively, had measurable 
retapamulin concentrations. The median C<span class="Sub">max</span> value in 
plasma after application to 800 cm<span class="Sup">2</span> of intact skin was 
3.5 ng/mL on Day 7 (range 1.2 to 7.8 ng/mL). The median C<span class="Sub">max</span> value in plasma after application to 200 cm<span class="Sup">2 </span>of abraded skin was 11.7 ng/mL on Day 1 (range 5.6 to 22.1 
ng/mL) and 9.0 ng/mL on Day 7 (range 6.7 to 12.8 ng/mL).</p>
<p>Plasma samples were obtained from 380 adult patients and 136 pediatric 
patients (aged 2-17 years) who were receiving topical treatment with ALTABAX 
topically twice daily. Eleven percent had measurable retapamulin concentrations 
(lower limit of quantitation 0.5 ng/mL), of which the median concentration was 
0.8 ng/mL. The maximum measured retapamulin concentration in adults was 
10.7 ng/mL and in pediatric patients was 18.5 ng/mL.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Underline">Distribution</span><p>Retapamulin is approximately 94% bound to human plasma proteins, 
and the protein binding is independent of concentration. The apparent volume of 
distribution of retapamulin has not been determined in humans.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Underline">Metabolism</span><p>In vitro studies with human hepatocytes showed that the main 
routes of metabolism were mono-oxygenation and di-oxygenation. In vitro studies 
with human liver microsomes demonstrated that retapamulin is extensively 
metabolized to numerous metabolites, of which the predominant routes of 
metabolism were mono-oxygenation and N-demethylation. The major enzyme 
responsible for metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsomes was 
cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4).</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Underline">Elimination</span><p>Retapamulin elimination in humans has not been investigated due 
to low systemic exposure after topical application.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>12.4 Microbiology<p>Retapamulin is a semisynthetic derivative of the compound 
pleuromutilin, which is isolated through fermentation from <span class="Italics">Clitopilus passeckerianus</span> (formerly <span class="Italics">Pleurotus passeckerianus</span>). In vitro activity of retapamulin 
against isolates of <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span> as well as 
<span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</span> has been demonstrated.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Underline">Antimicrobial Mechanism of 
Action</span><p>Retapamulin selectively inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by 
interacting at a site on the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome through an 
interaction that is different from that of other antibiotics. This binding site 
involves ribosomal protein L3 and is in the region of the ribosomal P site and 
peptidyl transferase center. By virtue of binding to this site, pleuromutilins 
inhibit peptidyl transfer, block P-site interactions, and prevent the normal 
formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits. Retapamulin is bacteriostatic 
against <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span> and <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</span> at the retapamulin in vitro minimum 
inhibitory concentration (MIC) for these organisms. At concentrations 1,000x the 
in vitro MIC, retapamulin is bactericidal against these same organisms. 
Retapamulin demonstrates no in vitrotarget-specific cross-resistance with other 
classes of antibiotics.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Underline">Mechanisms of Decreased 
Susceptibility to Retapamulin</span><p>In vitro, 2 mechanisms that cause reduced susceptibility to 
retapamulin have been identified, specifically, mutations in ribosomal protein 
L3 or the presence of an efflux mechanism. Decreased susceptibility of <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> to retapamulin (highest retapamulin MIC was 
2 mcg/mL) develops slowly in vitro via multistep mutations in L3 after serial 
passage in sub-inhibitory concentrations of retapamulin. There was no apparent 
treatment-associated reduction in susceptibility to retapamulin in the Phase 3 
clinical program. The clinical significance of these findings is not 
known.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Underline">Other</span><p>Based on in vitro broth microdilution susceptibility testing, no 
differences were observed in susceptibility of <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> to retapamulin whether the isolates were 
methicillin-resistant or methicillin-susceptible. Retapamulin susceptibility did 
not correlate with clinical success rates in patients with methicillin-resistant 
<span class="Italics">S.aureus</span>. The reason for this is not known but may 
have been influenced by the presence of particular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> possessing certain virulence factors, such as 
Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL). In the case of treatment failure associated 
with <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> (regardless of methicillin 
susceptibility), the presence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> possessing additional virulence factors 
(such as PVL) should be considered.</p>
<p>Retapamulin has been shown to be active against the following microorganisms, 
both in vitro and in clinical trials <span class="Italics">[see Indications and 
Usage (1)]</span>.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Aerobic and Facultative Gram-Positive Bacteria<p><span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span>

<p><span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</span></p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Underline">Susceptibility Testing</span><p>The clinical microbiology laboratory should provide cumulative 
results of the in vitro susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drugs used 
in local hospitals and practice areas to the physician as periodic reports that 
describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired 
pathogens. These reports should aid the physician in selecting the most 
effective antimicrobial.</p>

inhibitory concentration (MIC) of retapamulin that will inhibit the growth of 
the bacteria being tested. The MIC provides an estimate of the susceptibility of

retapamulin have not been determined for this topical antimicrobial. The

to clinical efficacy of retapamulin against the bacteria tested should be 
monitored.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Quality Control Parameters for Susceptibility 
Testing<p>In vitro susceptibility test quality control parameters were 
developed for retapamulin so that laboratories that test the susceptibility of 
bacterial isolates to retapamulin can determine if the susceptibility test is 
performing correctly. Standardized dilution techniques and diffusion methods 
require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to monitor the technical 
aspects of the laboratory procedures. Standard retapamulin powder should provide 
the following MIC and a 2 mcg retapamulin disk should produce the following zone 
diameters with the indicated quality control <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> in Table 3.</p>

<h1>14  CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First">ALTABAX was evaluated in a placebo-controlled study that enrolled 
adult and pediatric patients 9 months of age and older for treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140480" conceptname="Impetigo">impetigo</span> 
up to 100 cm<span class="Sup">2</span> in total area (up to 10 lesions) or a total 
body surface area not exceeding 2%. The majority of patients enrolled (164/210, 
78%) were under the age of 13. The study was a double-blind, randomized, 
multi-center, parallel-group comparison of the safety of ALTABAX and placebo 
ointment, both applied twice daily for 5 days. The study was randomized 2 
ALTABAX to 1 placebo patient. Patients with underlying skin disease (e.g., 
preexisting eczematous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133835" conceptname="Eczema">dermatitis</span>) or skin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433633" conceptname="Late effect of superficial injury">trauma</span>, with clinical evidence of 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442777" conceptname="Generalized infection during labor">secondary infection</span> were excluded from these studies. In addition, patients with 
any systemic signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> (such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>) were excluded from 
the study. Clinical success was defined as the absence of treated lesions, or 
treated lesions had become dry without crusts with or without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span> compared 
to baseline, or had improved (defined as a decline in the size of the affected 
area, number of lesions or both) such that no further antimicrobial therapy was 
required. The intent-to-treat clinical (ITTC) population consisted of all 
randomized patients who took at least 1 dose of study medication. The clinical 
per protocol (PPC) population included all ITTC patients who satisfied the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and subsequently adhered to the protocol. The 
intent-to-treat bacteriological (ITTB) population consisted of all randomized 
patients who took at least one dose of study medication and had a pathogen 
identified at study entry. The bacteriological per protocol (PPB) population 
included all ITTB patients who satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria and 
subsequently adhered to the protocol.</p>

<h1>17  PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION</h1>
<p class="First">Patients using ALTABAX and/or their guardians should receive the 
following information and instructions: Use ALTABAX as directed by the 
healthcare practitioner. As with any topical medication, patients and caregivers 
should wash their hands after application if the hands are not the area for 
treatment.</p>
<ul>
<li>ALTABAX is for external use only. Do not swallow ALTABAX or use it in the 
eyes, on the mouth or lips, inside the nose, or inside the female genital area. 
</li>
<li>The treated area may be covered by a sterile bandage or gauze dressing, if 
desired. This may also be helpful for infants and young children who 
accidentally touch or lick the lesion site. A bandage will protect the treated 
area and avoid accidental transfer of ointment to the eyes or other areas. 
</li>
<li>Use the medication for the full time recommended by the healthcare 
practitioner, even though symptoms may have improved. 
</li>
<li>Notify the healthcare practitioner if there is no improvement in symptoms 
within 3 to 4 days after starting use of ALTABAX. 
</li>
<li>ALTABAX may cause reactions at the site of application of the ointment. 
Inform the healthcare practitioner if the area of application worsens in 
irritation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">redness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302654" conceptname="Itching">itching</span>, burning, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443720" conceptname="Blister">blistering</span>, or oozing.
