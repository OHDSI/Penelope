<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Chloroprocaine, like other local anesthetics, blocks the generation and the conduction of nerve impulses, presumably by increasing the threshold for electrical excitation in the nerve, by slowing the propagation of the nerve impulse and by reducing the rate of rise of the action potential. In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers. Clinically, the order of loss of nerve function is as follows: (1)Â <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, (2) temperature, (3) touch, (4) proprioception, and (5) skeletal muscle tone.</p>
<p>Systemic absorption of local anesthetics produces effects on the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. At blood concentrations achieved with normal therapeutic doses, changes in cardiac conduction, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">excitability</span>, refractoriness, contractility, and peripheral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span> are minimal. However, toxic blood concentrations depress cardiac conduction and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">excitability</span>, which may lead to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316135" conceptname="Atrioventricular block">atrioventricular block</span> and ultimately to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span>. In addition, with toxic blood concentrations myocardial contractility may be depressed and peripheral vasodilation may occur, leading to decreased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span> and arterial blood pressure.</p>
<p>Following systemic absorption, toxic blood concentrations of local anesthetics can produce central nervous system stimulation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, or both. Apparent central stimulation may be manifested as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">restlessness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremors</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4190045" conceptname="Rigor">shivering</span>, which may progress to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span> may occur, possibly progressing ultimately to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317109" conceptname="Respiratory arrest">respiratory arrest</span>.</p>
<p>However, the local anesthetics have a primary depressant effect on the medulla and on higher centers. The depressed stage may occur without a prior stage of central nervous system stimulation.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">The rate of systemic absorption of local anesthetic drugs is dependent upon the total dose and concentration of drug administered, the route of administration, the vascularity of the administration site, and the presence or absence of epinephrine in the anesthetic injection. Epinephrine usually reduces the rate of absorption and plasma concentration of local anesthetics and is sometimes added to local anesthetic injections in order to prolong the duration of action.</p>
<p>The onset of action with chloroprocaine is rapid (usually within 6 to 12 minutes), and the duration of anesthesia, depending upon the amount used and the route of administration, may be up to 60 minutes.</p>
<p>Local anesthetics appear to cross the placenta by passive diffusion. However, the rate and degree of diffusion varies considerably among the different drugs as governed by: (1) the degree of plasma protein binding, (2) the degree of ionization, and (3) the degree of lipid solubility. Fetal/maternal ratios of local anesthetics appear to be inversely related to the degree of plasma protein binding, since only the free, unbound drug is available for placental transfer. Thus, drugs with the highest protein binding capacity may have the lowest fetal/maternal ratios. The extent of placental transfer is also determined by the degree of ionization and lipid solubility of the drug. Lipid soluble, nonionized drugs readily enter the fetal blood from the maternal circulation.</p>
<p>Depending upon the route of administration, local anesthetics are distributed to some extent to all body tissues with high concentrations found in highly perfused organs such as the liver, lungs, heart and brain.</p>
<p>
                  Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local anesthetics can be significantly altered by the presence of hepatic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>, addition of epinephrine, factors affecting urinary pH, renal blood flow, the route of administration, and the age of the patient. The <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">in vitro</span></span> plasma half-life of chloroprocaine in adults is 21 Â± 2 seconds for males and 25 Â± 1 seconds for females. The <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">in vitro</span></span> plasma half-life in neonates is 43 Â± 2 seconds.
                </p>
<p>
                  Chloroprocaine is rapidly metabolized in plasma by hydrolysis of the ester linkage by pseudocholinesterase. The hydrolysis of chloroprocaine results in the production of ÃŸ-diethyl-aminoethanol and 2-chloro-4-aminobenzoic acid, which inhibits the action of the sulfonamides (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics">PRECAUTIONS</span></span></span>).
                </p>
<p>The kidney is the main excretory organ for most local anesthetics and their metabolites. Urinary excretion is affected by urinary perfusion and factors affecting urinary pH.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First">
              LOCAL ANESTHETICS SHOULD ONLY BE EMPLOYED BY CLINICIANS WHO ARE WELL VERSED IN DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF DOSE-RELATED TOXICITY AND OTHER ACUTE EMERGENCIES WHICH MIGHT ARISE FROM THE BLOCK TO BE EMPLOYED, AND THEN ONLY AFTER ENSURING THE <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">IMMEDIATE</span></span> AVAILABILITY OF OXYGEN, OTHER RESUSCITATIVE DRUGS, CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATIVE EQUIPMENT, AND THE PERSONNEL RESOURCES NEEDED FOR PROPER MANAGEMENT OF TOXIC REACTIONS AND RELATED EMERGENCIES (See also <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span></span></span> and <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics">PRECAUTIONS</span></span></span>.) DELAY IN PROPER MANAGEMENT OF DOSE-RELATED TOXICITY, UNDERVENTILATION FROM ANY CAUSE AND/OR ALTERED SENSITIVITY MAY LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">ACIDOSIS</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">CARDIAC ARREST</span> AND, POSSIBLY, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">DEATH</span>.
            </p>
<p>Chloroprocaine Hydrochloride Injection, contains no preservative; discard unused injection remaining in vial after initial use.</p>
<p>Intra-articular infusions of local anesthetics following arthroscopic and other surgical procedures is an unapproved use, and there have been post-marketing reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span> in patients receiving such infusions. The majority of reported cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span> have involved the shoulder joint; cases of gleno-humeral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span> have been described in pediatric and adult patients following intra-articular infusions of local anesthetics with and without epinephrine for periods of 48 to 72 hours. There is insufficient information to determine whether shorter infusion periods are not associated with these findings. The time of onset of symptoms, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77074" conceptname="Joint pain">joint pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4060220" conceptname="Stiff neck">stiffness</span> and loss of motion can be variable, but may begin as early as the 2nd month after surgery. Currently, there is no effective treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span>; patients who experienced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span> have required additional diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and someÂ  required arthroplasty or shoulder replacement.</p>
<p>Vasopressors should not be used in the presence of ergot-type oxytocic drugs, since a severe persistent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> may occur.</p>
<p>To avoid intravascular injection, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span> should be performed before the anesthetic solution is injected. The needle must be repositioned until no blood return can be elicited. However, the absence of blood in the syringe does not guarantee that intravascular injection has been avoided.</p>
<p>Mixtures of local anesthetics are sometimes employed to compensate for the slower onset of one drug and the shorter duration of action of the second drug. Experiments in primates suggest that toxicity is probably additive when mixtures of local anesthetics are employed, but some experiments in rodents suggest synergism. Caution regarding toxic equivalence should be exercised when mixtures of local anesthetics are employed.</p>
<p>Chloroprocaine Hydrochloride Injection contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatic</span> episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatic</span> than in nonasthmatic people.</p>

<h2>General:</h2>
<p class="First">
                  The safety and effective use of chloroprocaine depend on proper dosage, correct technique, adequate precautions and readiness for emergencies. Resuscitative equipment, oxygen and other resuscitative drugs should be available for immediate use. (See <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics">WARNINGS</span></span></span> and <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span></span></span>). The lowest dosage that results in effective anesthesia should be used to avoid high plasma levels and serious adverse effects. Injections should be made slowly, with frequent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspirations</span> before and during the injection to avoid intravascular injection. Syringe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspirations</span> should also be performed before and during each supplemental injection in continuous (intermittent) catheter techniques. During the administration of epidural anesthesia, it is recommended that a test dose be administered (3 mL of 3% or 5 mL of 2% Chloroprocaine Hydrochloride Injection) initially and that the patient be monitored for central nervous system toxicity and cardiovascular toxicity, as well as for signs of unintended intrathecal administration, before proceeding. When clinical conditions permit, consideration should be given to employing a chloroprocaine solution that contains epinephrine for the test dose because circulatory changes characteristic of epinephrine may also serve as a warning sign of unintended intravascular injection. An intravascular injection is still possible even if <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspirations</span> for blood are negative. With the use of continuous catheter techniques, it is recommended that a fraction of each supplemental dose be administered as a test dose in order to verify proper location of the catheter.
                </p>
<p>Injection of repeated doses of local anesthetics may cause significant increases in plasma levels with each repeated dose due to slow accumulation of the drug or its metabolites. Tolerance to elevated blood levels varies with the physical condition of the patient. Debilitated, elderly patients, acutely ill patients, and children should be given reduced doses commensurate with their age and physical status. Local anesthetics should also be used with caution in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316135" conceptname="Atrioventricular block">heart block</span>.</p>
<p>Careful and constant monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory (adequacy of ventilation) vital signs and the patientâ€™s state of consciousness should be accomplished after each local anesthetic injection. It should be kept in mind at such times that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">restlessness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377575" conceptname="Tinnitus">tinnitus</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079185" conceptname="Hazy vision">blurred vision</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremors</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> may be early warning signs of central nervous system toxicity.</p>
<p>Local anesthetic injections containing a vasoconstrictor should be used cautiously and in carefully circumscribed quantities in areas of the body supplied by end arteries or having otherwise compromised blood supply. Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321052" conceptname="Peripheral vascular disease">peripheral vascular disease</span> and those with hypertensive vascular disease may exhibit exaggerated vasoconstrictor response. Ischemic injury or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280654" conceptname="Necrosis">necrosis</span> may result.</p>
<p>Since ester-type local anesthetics are hydrolyzed by plasma <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052720" conceptname="Acetylcholinesterase">cholinesterase</span> produced by the liver, chloroprocaine should be used cautiously in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span>.</p>
<p>Local anesthetics should also be used with caution in patients with impaired cardiovascular function since they may be less able to compensate for functional changes associated with the prolongation of A-V conduction produced by these drugs.</p>

<h2>Use in Ophthalmic Surgery:</h2>
<p class="First">When local anesthetic injections are employed for retrobulbar block, lack of corneal sensation should not be relied upon to determine whether or not the patient is ready for surgery.

<h2>Clinically Significant Drug Interactions:</h2>
<p class="First">The administration of local anesthetic solutions containing epinephrine or norepinephrine to patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or phenothiazines may produce severe prolonged <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>. Concurrent use of these agents should generally be avoided. In situations when concurrent therapy is necessary, careful patient monitoring is essential.</p>
<p>Concurrent administration of vasopressor drugs (for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> related to obstetric blocks) and ergot-type oxytocic drugs may cause severe, persistent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">cerebrovascular accidents</span>.</p>
<p>    The para-aminobenzoic acid metabolite of chloroprocaine inhibits the action of sulfonamides. Therefore, chloroprocaine should not be used in any condition in which a sulfonamide drug is being employed.</p>

<h2>Labor andÂ Delivery:</h2>
<p class="First">Local anesthetics rapidly cross the placenta, and when used for epidural, paracervical, pudendal or caudal block anesthesia, can cause varying degrees of maternal, fetal and neonatal toxicity.</p>
<p>
                  (See <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span></span></span>â€“<span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Pharmacokinetics</span></span>).
                </p>
<p>The incidence and degree of toxicity depend upon the procedure performed, the type and amount of drug used, and the technique of drug administration. Adverse reactions in the parturient, fetus and neonate involve alterations of the central nervous system, peripheral vascular tone and cardiac function.</p>
<p>Maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> has resulted from regional anesthesia. Local anesthetics produce vasodilation by blocking sympathetic nerves. Elevating the patientâ€™s legs and positioning her on her left side will help prevent decreases in blood pressure. The fetal heart rate also should be monitored continuously, and electronic fetal monitoring is highly advisable. Epidural, paracervical, or pudendal anesthesia may alter the forces of parturition through changes in uterine contractility or maternal expulsive efforts. In one study, paracervical block anesthesia was associated with a decrease in the mean duration of first stage labor and facilitation of cervical dilation. However, epidural anesthesia has also been reported to prolong the second stage of labor by removing the parturientâ€™s reflex urge to bear down or by interfering with motor function. The use of obstetrical anesthesia may increase the need for forceps assistance.</p>
<p>The use of some local anesthetic drug products during labor and delivery may be followed by diminished muscle strength and tone for the first day or two of life. The long-term significance of these observations is unknown.</p>
<p>Careful adherence to recommended dosage is of the utmost importance in obstetrical paracervical block. Failure to achieve adequate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> with recommended doses should arouse suspicion of intravascular or fetal intracranial injection. Cases compatible with unintended fetal intracranial injection of local anesthetic injection have been reported following intended paracervical or pudendal block or both. Babies so affected present with unexplained neonatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> at birth which correlates with high local anesthetic serum levels and usually manifest <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> within six hours. Prompt use of supportive measures combined with forced urinary excretion of the local anesthetic has been used successfully to manage this complication.</p>
<p>Case reports of maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443240" conceptname="Collapse">cardiovascular collapse</span> following use of some local anesthetics for paracervical block in early pregnancy (as anesthesia for elective abortion) suggest that systemic absorption under these circumstances may be rapid. The recommended maximum dose of each drug should not be exceeded. Injection should be made slowly and with frequent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span>.

<p class="First">Clinical studies of Chloroprocaine Hydrochloride Injection did not include sufficient number of subjects 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Systemic:</span></span></p>
<p>The most commonly encountered acute adverse experiences that demand immediate countermeasures are related to the central nervous system and the cardiovascular system. These adverse experiences are generally dose-related and may result from rapid absorption from the injection site, diminished tolerance or from unintentional intravascular injection of the local anesthetic solution. In addition to systemic dose-related toxicity, unintentional subarachnoid injection of drug during the intended performance of caudal or lumbar epidural block or nerve blocks near the vertebral column (especially in the head and neck region) may result in underventilation or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span> (â€œTotal Spinalâ€?). Factors influencing plasma protein binding, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidosis</span>, systemic diseases that alter protein production, or competition of other drugs for protein binding sites, may diminish individual tolerance. Plasma <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052720" conceptname="Acetylcholinesterase">cholinesterase</span> deficiency may also account for diminished tolerance to ester-type local anesthetics.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Central Nervous System Reactions:</span></span></p>
<p>These are characterized by excitation and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">Restlessness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377575" conceptname="Tinnitus">tinnitus</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079185" conceptname="Hazy vision">blurred vision</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremors</span> may occur, possibly proceeding to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>. However, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">excitement</span> may be transient or absent, with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> being the first manifestation of an adverse reaction.

<p>The incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> associated with the use of local anesthetics varies with the procedure used and the total dose administered. In a survey of studies of epidural anesthesia, overt toxicity progressing to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> occurred in approximately 0.1 percent of local anesthetic administrations.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Cardiovascular System Reactions:</span></span></p>
<p>High doses, or unintended intravascular injection, may lead to high plasma levels and related <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> of the myocardium, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span> and, possibly, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span>.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">
              Acute emergencies from local anesthetics are generally related to high plasma levels encountered during therapeutic use of local anesthetics or to unintended subarachnoid injection of local anesthetic solution (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span></span></span>, <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics">WARNINGS</span></span></span>, and <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics">PRECAUTIONS</span></span></span>).
            </p>
<p>
              In mice, the intravenous LD<span class="Sub">50</span> of chloroprocaine HCl is 97 mg/kg and the subcutaneous LD<span class="Sub">50 </span>of chloroprocaine HCl is 950 mg/kg.
            </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Management of Local Anesthetic Emergencies:</span></span></p>
<p>The first consideration is prevention, best accomplished by careful and constant monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory vital signs and the patientâ€™s state of consciousness after each local anesthetic injection. At the first sign of change, oxygen should be administered.</p>
<p>The first step in the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>, as well as underventilation or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span> due to unintentional subarachnoid injection of drug solution, consists of immediate attention to the maintenance of a patent airway and assisted or controlled ventilation with oxygen and a delivery system capable of permitting immediate positive airway pressure by mask. Immediately after the institution of these ventilatory measures, the adequacy of the circulation should be evaluated, keeping in mind that drugs used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> sometimes depress the circulation when administered intravenously. Should <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> persist despite adequate respiratory support, and if the status of the circulation permits, small increments of an ultra-short acting barbiturate (such as thiopental or thiamylal) or a benzodiazepine (such as diazepam) may be administered intravenously; the clinician should be familiar, prior to the use of local anesthetics, with these anticonvulsant drugs. Supportive treatment of circulatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> may require administration of intravenous fluids and, when appropriate, a vasopressor dictated by the clinical situation (such as ephedrine to enhance myocardial contractile force).</p>
<p>If not treated immediately, both <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> and cardiovascular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> can result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span>. Underventilation or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span> due to unintentional subarachnoid injection of local anesthetic solution may produce these same signs and also lead to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span> if ventilatory support is not instituted. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span> should occur, standard cardiopulmonary resuscitative measures should be instituted. Recovery has been reported after prolonged resuscitative efforts.</p>
<p>Endotracheal intubation, employing drugs and techniques familiar to the clinician, may be indicated, after initial administration of oxygen by mask, if difficulty is encountered in the maintenance of a patent airway or if prolonged ventilatory support (assisted or controlled) is indicated.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Chloroprocaine may be administered as a single injection or continuously through an indwelling catheter. As with all local anesthetics, the dose administered varies with the anesthetic procedure, the vascularity of the tissues, the depth of anesthesia and degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">muscle relaxation</span> required, the duration of anesthesia desired, and the physical condition of the patient. The smallest dose and concentration required to produce the desired result should be used. Dosage should be reduced for children, elderly and debilitated patients and patients with cardiac and/or liver disease. The maximum single recommended doses of chloroprocaine in adults are: without epinephrine, 11Â mg/kg, not to exceed a maximum total dose of 800 mg; with epinephrine (1:200,000), 14 mg/kg, not to exceed a maximum total dose of 1000 mg. For specific techniques and procedures, refer to standard textbooks.</p>
<p>There have been adverse event reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span> in patients receiving intra-articular infusions of local anesthetics following arthroscopic and other surgical procedures.Â  Chloroprocaine is not approved for this use (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics">WARNINGS</span></span></span> and <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics">DOSAGEÂ AND ADMINISTRATION</span></span></span>). </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics">Caudal and Lumbar Epidural Block:</span></span></span></p>
<p>In order to guard against adverse experiences sometimes noted following unintended penetration of the subarachnoid space, the following procedure modifications are recommended:</p>
<p>1. Use an adequate test dose (3 mL of 3% or 5 mL of 2% Chloroprocaine Hydrochloride Injection) prior to induction of complete block. This test dose should be repeated if the patient is moved in such a fashion as to have displaced the epidural catheter. Allow adequate time for onset of anesthesia following administration of each test dose. 2. Avoid the rapid injection of a large volume of local anesthetic injection through the catheter. Consider fractional doses, when feasible. 3. In the event of the known injection of a large volume of local anesthetic injection into the subarachnoid space, after suitable resuscitation and if the catheter is in place, consider attempting the recovery of drug by draining a moderate amount of cerebrospinal fluid (such as 10 mL) through the epidural catheter.</p>

<br><p>Â Â Â  2.Â  Caudal and Lumbar Epidural Block: For caudal anesthesia, the initial dose is 15 to 25 mL of aÂ 2% or 3% solution. Repeated doses may be given at 40 to 60 minute intervals.</p>
<p>For lumbar epidural anesthesia, 2 to 2.5 mL per segment of a 2% or 3% solution can be used. The usual total volume of Chloroprocaine Hydrochloride Injection is from 15 to 25 mL. Repeated doses 2 to 6 mL less than the original dose may be given at 40 to 50 minute intervals.</p>
<p>The above dosages are recommended as a guide for use in the average adult. Maximum dosages of all local anesthetics must be individualized after evaluating the size and physical condition of the patient and the rate of systemic absorption from a particular injection site.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Pediatric Dosage:</span></span></p>
<p>It is difficult to recommend a maximum dose of any drug for children, since this varies as a function of age and weight. For children over 3 years of age who have a normal lean body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> and normal body development, the maximum dose is determined by the childâ€™s age and weight and should not exceed 11 mg/kg (5 mg/lb). For example, in a child of 5 years weighing 50 lbs (23 kg), the dose of chloroprocaine HCl without epinephrine would be 250 mg. Concentrations of 0.5 â€“ 1% are suggested for infiltration and 1 â€“ 1.5% for nerve block. In order to guard against systemic toxicity, the lowest effective concentration and lowest effective dose should be used at all times. Some of the lower concentrations for use in infants and smaller children are not available in pre-packaged containers; it will be necessary to dilute available concentrations with the amount of 0.9% sodium chloride injection necessary to obtain the required final concentration of chloroprocaine injection.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Preparation of Epinephrine Injections:</span></span></p>
<p>To prepare a 1:200,000 epinephrine-chloroprocaine HCl injection, add 0.15 mL of 1 to 1000Â Epinephrine Injection to 30 mL of Chloroprocaine Hydrochloride Injection.</p>
<p>Chloroprocaine is incompatible with caustic alkalis and their carbonates, soaps, silver salts, iodine and iodides.</p>
<p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever injection and container permit. As with other anesthetics having a free aromatic amino group, Chloroprocaine Hydrochloride Injection is slightly photosensitive and may become discolored after prolonged exposure to light. It is recommended that this product be stored in the original outer containers, protected from direct sunlight. Discolored injection should not be administered. If exposed to low temperatures, Chloroprocaine Hydrochloride Injection may deposit crystals of chloroprocaine HCl which will redissolve with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">shaking</span> when returned to room temperature. The product should not be used if it contains undissolved (e.g., particulate) material.</p>
