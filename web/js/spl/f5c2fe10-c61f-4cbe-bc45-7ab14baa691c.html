<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution is a relatively selective beta2-adrenergic bronchodilator (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Albuterol sulfate, USP, the racemic form of albuterol, has the chemical name α<span class="Sup">1</span>-[(tert-Butylamino)methyl]-4-hydroxy-m-xylene-α,α'-diol sulfate (2:1) (salt) and the following structural formula:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="Image from Drug Label Content" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=f5c2fe10-c61f-4cbe-bc45-7ab14baa691c&amp;name=albuterol-01.jpg"></div>
<p>Albuterol sulfate has a molecular weight of 576.71, and the molecular formula is (C<span class="Sub">13</span>H<span class="Sub">21</span>NO<span class="Sub">3</span>)<span class="Sub">2</span> • H<span class="Sub">2</span>SO<span class="Sub">4</span>. Albuterol sulfate is a white crystalline powder, soluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol. </p>
<p>The World Health Organization recommended name for albuterol base is salbutamol. </p>
<p>Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution requires no dilution before administration by nebulization. </p>
<p>Each milliliter of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution contains 0.83 mg of albuterol (as 1 mg of albuterol sulfate) in an isotonic, sterile, aqueous solution containing sodium chloride; sulfuric acid is used to adjust the pH to between 3 and 5. Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution contains no sulfiting agents or preservatives. </p>
<p>Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution is a clear, colorless to light yellow solution.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies and in vivo pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that albuterol has a preferential effect on beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic receptors compared with isoproterenol. While it is recognized that beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, data indicate that 10% to 50% of the beta-receptors in the human heart may be beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-receptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established. </p>
<p>The pharmacologic effects of beta-adrenergic agonist drugs, including albuterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation through beta-adrenergic receptors of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223759" conceptname="IgE-mediated allergic disorder">immediate hypersensitivity</span> from cells, especially from mast cells. </p>
<p>Albuterol has been shown in most controlled clinical trials to have more effect on the respiratory tract, in the form of bronchial smooth <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">muscle relaxation</span>, than isoproterenol at comparable doses while producing fewer cardiovascular effects. </p>
<p>Controlled clinical studies and other clinical experience have shown that inhaled albuterol, like other beta-adrenergic agonist drugs, can produce a significant cardiovascular effect in some patients, as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, symptoms, and/or electrocardiographic changes. </p>
<p>Albuterol is longer acting than isoproterenol in most patients by any route of administration because it is not a substrate for the cellular uptake processes for catecholamines nor for catechol-O-methyl transferase. </p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Studies in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatic</span> patients have shown that less than 20% of a single albuterol dose was absorbed following either IPPB (intermittent positive-pressure breathing) or nebulizer administration; the remaining amount was recovered from the nebulizer and apparatus and expired air. Most of the absorbed dose was recovered in the urine 24 hours after drug administration. Following a 3-mg dose of nebulized albuterol in adults, the maximum albuterol plasma levels at 0.5 hours were 2.1 ng/mL (range, 1.4 to 3.2 ng/mL). There was a significant dose-related response in FEV<span class="Sub">1</span> (forced expiratory volume in one second) and peak flow rate. It has been demonstrated that following oral administration of 4 mg of albuterol, the elimination half-life was 5 to 6 hours. </p>

<a name="splSection2"></a><a name="section-3.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Preclinical</h2>
<p class="First">Intravenous studies in rats with albuterol sulfate have demonstrated that albuterol crosses the blood-brain barrier and reaches brain concentrations amounting to approximately 5.0% of the plasma concentrations. In structures outside the blood-brain barrier (pineal and pituitary glands), albuterol concentrations were found to be 100 times those in the whole brain. </p>
<p>Studies in laboratory animals (minipigs, rodents, and dogs) have demonstrated the occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmias</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4132309" conceptname="Sudden death">sudden death</span> (with histologic evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4354249" conceptname="Myocardial necrosis">myocardial necrosis</span>) when beta-agonists and methylxanthines were administered concurrently. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. </p>

<a name="splSection3"></a><a name="section-3.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Clinical Trials</h2>
<p class="First">In controlled clinical trials in adults, most patients exhibited an onset of improvement in pulmonary function within 5 minutes as determined by FEV<span class="Sub">1</span>. FEV<span class="Sub">1 </span>measurements also showed that the maximum average improvement in pulmonary function usually occurred at approximately 1 hour following inhalation of 2.5 mg of albuterol by compressor-nebulizer and remained close to peak for 2 hours. Clinically significant improvement in pulmonary function (defined as maintenance of a 15% or more increase in FEV<span class="Sub">1</span> over baseline values) continued for 3 to 4 hours in most patients, with some patients continuing up to 6 hours. </p>
<p>Published reports of trials in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatic</span> children aged 3 years or older have demonstrated significant improvement in either FEV<span class="Sub">1</span> or PEFR within 2 to 20 minutes following single doses of albuterol inhalation solution. An increase of 15% or more in baseline FEV<span class="Sub">1</span> has been observed in children aged 5 to 11 years up to 6 hours after treatment with doses of 0.10 mg/kg or higher of albuterol inhalation solution. Single doses of 3, 4, or 10 mg resulted in improvement in baseline PEFR that was comparable in extent and duration to a 2-mg dose, but doses above 3 mg were associated with heart rate increases of more than 10%. </p>

<h2>Information For Patients</h2>
<p class="First">The action of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution may last up to 6 hours or longer. Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution should not be used more frequently than recommended. Do not increase the dose or frequency of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution without consulting your physician. If you find that treatment with Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution becomes less effective for symptomatic relief, your symptoms become worse, and/or you need to use the product more frequently than usual, you should seek medical attention immediately. While you are using Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, other inhaled drugs and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> medications should be taken only as directed by your physician. Common adverse effects include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315078" conceptname="Palpitations">palpitations</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77670" conceptname="Chest pain">chest pain</span>, rapid heart rate, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436817" conceptname="Feeling nervous">nervousness</span>. If you are pregnant or nursing, contact your physician about use of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution. Effective and safe use of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution includes an understanding of the way that it should be administered. </p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Other short-acting sympathomimetic aerosol bronchodilators or epinephrine should not be used concomitantly with albuterol. If additional adrenergic drugs are to be administered by any route, they should be used with caution to avoid deleterious cardiovascular effects. </p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="splSection9"></a><a name="section-7.4"></a><p></p>
<h2>Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors or Tricyclic Antidepressants</h2>
<p class="First">Albuterol should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents, because the action of albuterol on the vascular system may be potentiated. </p>

<a name="splSection10"></a><a name="section-7.5"></a><p></p>
<h2>Beta-Blockers</h2>
<p class="First">Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists, such as Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, but may produce severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256717" conceptname="Bronchospasm">bronchospasm</span> in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatic</span> patients. Therefore, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> should not normally be treated with betablockers. However, under certain circumstances, e.g., as prophylaxis after <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>. In this setting, cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution. </p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">In a 2-year study in Sprague-Dawley rats, albuterol sulfate caused a significant dose-related increase in the incidence of benign leiomyomas of the mesovarium at dietary doses of 2.0, 10, and 50 mg/kg (approximately 2, 8, and 40 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, or, approximately 3/5, 3, and 15 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in children on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). In another study this effect was blocked by the coadministration of propranolol, a non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist. In an 18-month study in CD-1 mice albuterol sulfate showed no evidence of tumorigenicity at dietary doses of up to 500 mg/kg (approximately 200 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, or, approximately 75 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for children on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for albuterol in some animal studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. </p>

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution have been established in children 2 years of age or older. Use of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution in these age-groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution in adults; the likelihood that the disease course, pathophysiology, and the drug's effect in pediatric and adult patients are substantially similar; and published reports of trials in pediatric patients 3 years of age or older. The recommended dose for the pediatric population is based upon three published dose comparison studies of efficacy and safety in children 5 to 17 years, and on the safety profile in both adults and pediatric patients at doses equal to or higher than the recommended doses. The safety and effectiveness of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution in children below 2 years of age have not been established.</p>

<p>As with all sympathomimetic medications, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span> and even <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> may be associated with abuse of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution. Treatment consists of discontinuation of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution together with appropriate symptomatic therapy. The judicious use of a cardioselective beta-receptor blocker may be considered, bearing in mind that such medication can produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256717" conceptname="Bronchospasm">bronchospasm</span>. There is insufficient evidence to determine if dialysis is beneficial for overdosage of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution. </p>
<p>The oral median lethal dose of albuterol sulfate in mice is greater than 2000 mg/kg (approximately 810 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, or, approximately 300 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for children on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).

<a name="splSection14"></a><a name="section-10.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Adults and Children 2 to 12 Years of Age</h2>
<p class="First">The usual dosage for adults and for children weighing at least 15 kg is 2.5 mg of albuterol (one unit dose vial) administered three to four times daily by nebulization. Children weighing less than 15 kg who require less than 2.5 mg/dose (i.e., less than a full unit dose vial) should use Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, 0.5% instead of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, 0.083%. More frequent administration or higher doses are not recommended. To administer 2.5 mg of albuterol, administer the entire contents of one sterile unit dose vial (3 mL of 0.083% inhalation solution) by nebulization. The flow rate is regulated to suit the particular nebulizer so that Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution will be delivered over approximately 5 to 15 minutes. </p>
<p>The use of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution can be continued as medically indicated to control recurring bouts of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256717" conceptname="Bronchospasm">bronchospasm</span>. During this time most patients gain optimal benefit from regular use of the inhalation solution. </p>
<p>If a previously effective dosage regimen fails to provide the usual relief, medical advice should be sought immediately as this is often a sign of seriously worsening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> that would require reassessment of therapy. </p>
<p>Drug compatibility (physical and chemical), efficacy, and safety of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established. </p>

<h2>Microbial Contamination</h2>
<p class="First">To avoid microbial contamination, the entire contents of the unit-dose vial should be administered immediately after the vial has been opened for the first time.  The nebulizer should be cleaned in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.  Failure to do so could lead to bacterial contamination of the nebulizer and possible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>.</p>
