<h1>DESCRIPTION<span class="Italics"></span>
</h1>
<p class="First">Refissa [Tretinoin Cream, USP (Emollient) 0.05%], contains the active ingredient tretinoin (a retinoid) in an emollient cream base. Tretinoin is a yellow-to-light-orange crystalline powder having a characteristic floral odor. Tretinoin is soluble in dimethylsulfoxide, slightly soluble in polyethylene glycol 400, octanol, and 100% ethanol. It is practically insoluble in water and mineral oil, and it is insoluble in glycerin. The chemical name for tretinoin is (all-E)-3,7-dimethyl-9-(2,6,6-trimethyl-1-cyclonexen-1-yl)-2,4,6,8-nonatetraenoic acid. Tretinoin is also referred to as all-<span class="Italics">trans</span>-retinoic acid and has a molecular weight of 300.44. The structural formula is represented below. </p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">The exact mechanism of action of tretinoin is unknown although retinoids are believed to exert an effect on the growth and differentiation of various epithelial cells. When applied topically, however, there was no noted increase in desmosine, hydroxyproline, or elastin mRNA in human skin. In addition, the role of the irritative nature of this product in effecting the positive effects attributed to this product for its indication has not yet been fully determined.</p>
<p>The transdermal absorption of tretinoin from various topical formulations ranged from 1% to 31% of applied dose, depending on whether it was applied to healthy skin or dermatitic skin. When percutaneous absorption of Tretinoin Cream, USP (Emollient) 0.05% was assessed in healthy male subjects (n=14) after a single application, as well as after repeated daily applications for 28 days, the absorption of tretinoin was less than 2% and endogenous concentrations of tretinoin and its major metabolites were unaltered.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL TRIALS DATA</h1>
<p class="First">Two adequate and well-controlled trials were conducted involving a total of 161 evaluable patients (under 50 years of age) treated with Tretinoin Cream, USP (Emollient) 0.05% and 154 evaluable patients treated with the vehicle emollient cream on the face for 24 weeks as an adjunct to a comprehensive skin care and sun avoidance program, to assess the effects on fine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkling</span>, mottled hyperpigmentation, and tactile skin roughness. Patients were evaluated at baseline on a 10-point scale, and changes from that baseline rating were categorized as follows:<br><br>No Improvement:Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â  No change or an increase of 1 unit or more<br>Minimal Improvement:Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Reduction of 1 unit<br>Moderate Improvement:Â Â  Â Â Â  Reduction of 2 units or more<br><br>In these trials, the fine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkles</span>, mottled hyperpigmentation, and tactile roughness of the facial skin were thought to be caused by multiple factors which included intrinsic aging or environmental factors, such as chronic sun exposure.<br><br>The results of these assessments are as follows:</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>Refissa [Tretinoin Cream, USP (Emollient) 0.05%] is a dermal irritant, and the results of continued irritation of the skin for greater than 48 weeks in chronic long-term use are not known. There is evidence of atypical changes in melanocytes and keratinocytes, and of increased dermal elastosis in some patients treated with Tretinoin Cream, USP (Emollient) 0.05% for longer than 48 weeks. The significance of these findings is unknown.</dd>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>Safety and effectiveness of Refissa in individuals with moderately or heavily pigmented skin have not been established.</dd>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>Refissa should not be administered if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers (e.g., thiazides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides) because of the possibility of augmented <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4080920" conceptname="Phytophotodermatitis">phototoxicity</span>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="First">Because of heightened burning susceptibility, exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps) should be avoided or minimized during use of Refissa. Patients must be warned to use sunscreens (minimum SPF of 15) and protective clothing when using Refissa. Patients with sunburn should be advised not to use Refissa until fully recovered. Patients who may have considerable sun exposure, e.g., due to their occupation and those patients with inherent sensitivity to sunlight, should exercise particular caution when using Refissa and assure that the precautions outlined in the Patient Package Insert are observed.</p>
<p>Tretinoin Cream, USP (Emollient) 0.05% should be kept out of the eyes, mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may cause severe local <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span>, burning, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">stinging</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4032013" conceptname="Desquamation">peeling</span> at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use less medication, decrease the frequency of application, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether.</p>
<p>Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used only with caution in patients with this condition.</p>
<p>Application of larger amounts of medication than recommended will not lead to more rapid or better results, and marked <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">redness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4032013" conceptname="Desquamation">peeling</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090431" conceptname="Discomfort">discomfort</span> may occur.</p>

The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span> of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when tretinoin was administered topically at a dose 5 times the average recommended human topical clinical dose.

<p class="First">Patients require detailed instruction to obtain maximal benefits and to understand all the precautions necessary to use this product with greatest safety. The physician should review the Patient Package Insert.</p>
<p>Refissa should be applied to the face once a day before retiring, using only enough to cover the entire affected area lightly. Patients should gently wash their faces with a mild soap, pat the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4039266" conceptname="Dry skin">skin dry</span>, and wait 20 to 30 minutes before applying Refissa.

Up to six months of therapy may be required before the effects are seen. Most of the improvement noted with Refissa is seen during the first 24 weeks of therapy. Thereafter, therapy primarily maintains the improvement realized during the first 24 weeks.</p>
<p>With discontinuation of Refissa therapy, a majority of patients will lose most mitigating effects of Refissa on fine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkles</span>, mottled hyperpigmentation, and tactile roughness of facial skin; <span class="Bold">however, the safety and effectiveness of using Refissa daily for greater than 48 weeks have <span class="Underline">not</span> been established.</span></p>
