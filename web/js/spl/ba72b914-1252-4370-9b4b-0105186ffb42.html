<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"><a href="http://"></a><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action:</span> The principal metabolite of quinapril, 
quinaprilat, is an inhibitor of ACE activity in human subjects and animals. ACE 
is peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the 
vasoconstrictor, angiotensin II. The effect of quinapril in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> appears 
to result primarily from the inhibition of circulating and tissue ACE activity, 
thereby reducing angiotensin II formation. Quinapril inhibits the elevation in 
blood pressure caused by intravenously administered angiotensin I, but has no 
effect on the pressor response to angiotensin II, norepinephrine, or 
epinephrine. Angiotensin II also stimulates the secretion of aldosterone from 
the adrenal cortex, thereby facilitating renal sodium and fluid reabsorption. 
Reduced aldosterone secretion by quinapril may result in a small increase in 
serum potassium. In controlled <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> trials, treatment with quinapril 
alone resulted in mean increases in potassium of 0.07 mmol/L (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>). Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on 
renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity (PRA).</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>While the principal 
mechanism of antihypertensive effect is thought to be through the 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, quinapril exerts antihypertensive actions 
even in patients with low renin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>. Quinapril was an effective 
antihypertensive in all races studied, although it was somewhat less effective 
in blacks (usually a predominantly low renin group) than in non-blacks. ACE is 
identical to kininase II, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin, a potent peptide 
vasodilator; whether increased levels of bradykinin play a role in the 
therapeutic effect of quinapril remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>Hydrochlorothiazide is a 
thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte 
reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in 
approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of 
hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma 
renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary 
potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is 
mediated by angiotensin, so coadministration of an ACE inhibitor tends to 
reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics. </p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>The mechanism of the 
antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown.</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism:</span> The rate and extent of 
absorption of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide from quinapril hydrochloride and 
hydrochlorothiazide tablets are not different, respectively, from the rate and 
extent of absorption of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide from immediate-release 
monotherapy formulations, either administered concurrently or separately. 
Following oral administration of quinapril monotherapy tablets, peak plasma 
quinapril concentrations are observed within 1 hour. Based on recovery of 
quinapril and its metabolites in urine, the extent of absorption is at least 
60%. The absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is somewhat slower (1 to 2.5 hours) 
and more complete (50% to 80%).</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>The rate of quinapril 
absorption was reduced by 14% when quinapril hydrochloride and 
hydrochlorothiazide tablets were administered with a high-fat meal as compared 
to fasting, while the extent of absorption was not affected. The rate of 
hydrochlorothiazide absorption was reduced by 12% when quinapril hydrochloride 
and hydrochlorothiazide tablets were administered with a high-fat meal, while 
the extent of absorption was not significantly affected. Therefore, quinapril 
hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide may be administered without regard to 
food.</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>Following absorption, 
quinapril is deesterified to its major active metabolite, quinaprilat (about 38% 
of oral dose), and to other minor inactive metabolites. Following multiple oral 
dosing of quinapril, there is an effective accumulation half-life of quinaprilat 
of approximately 3 hours, and peak plasma quinaprilat concentrations are 
observed approximately 2 hours postdose. Approximately 97% of either quinapril 
or quinaprilat circulating in plasma is bound to proteins. Hydrochlorothiazide 
is not metabolized. Its apparent volume of distribution is 3.6 to 7.8 L/kg, 
consistent with measured plasma protein binding of 67.9%. The drug also 
accumulates in red blood cells, so that whole blood levels are 1.6 to 1.8 times 
those measured in plasma.</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>Some placental passage 
occurred when quinapril was administered to pregnant rats. Studies in rats 
indicate that quinapril and its metabolites do not cross the blood-brain 
barrier. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta freely but not the blood-brain 
barrier. </p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>Quinaprilat is 
eliminated primarily by renal excretion, up to 96% of an IV dose, and has an 
elimination half-life in plasma of approximately 2 hours and a prolonged 
terminal phase with a half-life of 25 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide is excreted 
unchanged by the kidney. When plasma levels have been followed for at least 24 
hours, the plasma half-life has been observed to vary between 4 to 15 hours. At 
least 61% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours.</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>In patients with renal 
insufficiency, the elimination half-life of quinaprilat increases as creatinine 
clearance decreases. There is a linear correlation between plasma quinaprilat 
clearance and creatinine clearance. In patients with end-stage <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>, 
chronic hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis have little 
effect on the elimination of quinapril and quinaprilat. Elimination of 
quinaprilat is reduced in elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years) and in those with heart 
failure; this reduction is attributable to decrease in renal function (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>). Quinaprilat concentrations are 
reduced in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196463" conceptname="Alcoholic cirrhosis">alcoholic cirrhosis</span> due to impaired deesterification of 
quinapril. In a study of patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> (mean creatinine 
clearance of 19 mL/min), the half-life of hydrochlorothiazide elimination was 
lengthened to 21 hours.</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>The pharmacokinetics of 
quinapril and quinaprilat are linear over a single-dose range of 5 to 80 mg 
doses and 40 to 160 mg in multiple daily doses.</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a><span class="Bold">Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects:</span> Single doses of 20 mg 
of quinapril provide over 80% inhibition of plasma ACE for 24 hours. Inhibition 
of the pressor response to angiotensin I is shorter-lived, with a 20 mg dose 
giving 75% inhibition for about 4 hours, 50% inhibition for about 8 hours, and 
20% inhibition at 24 hours. With chronic dosing, however, there is substantial 
inhibition of angiotensin II levels at 24 hours by doses of 20 to 80 mg.</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>Administration of 10 to 
80 mg of quinapril to patients with mild to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> results in a 
reduction of sitting and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with 
minimal effect on heart rate. Symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span> is infrequent, 
although it can occur in patients who are salt- and/or volume-depleted (see 
<span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>). </p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>Antihypertensive 
activity commences within 1 hour with peak effects usually achieved by 2 to 4 
hours after dosing. During chronic therapy, most of the blood pressure lowering 
effect of a given dose is obtained in 1 to 2 weeks. In multiple-dose studies, 10 
to 80 mg per day in single or divided doses lowered systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure throughout the dosing interval, with a trough effect of about 5 to 11/3 
to 7 mm Hg. The trough effect represents about 50% of the peak effect.</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>While the dose-response 
relationship is relatively flat, doses of 40 to 80 mg were somewhat more 
effective at trough than 10 to 20 mg, and twice-daily dosing tended to give a 
somewhat lower trough blood pressure than once-daily dosing with the same total 
dose. The antihypertensive effect of quinapril continues during long-term 
therapy, with no evidence of loss of effectiveness.</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>Hemodynamic assessments 
in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> indicate that blood pressure reduction produced by 
quinapril is accompanied by a reduction in total peripheral resistance and renal 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span> with little or no change in heart rate, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208254" conceptname="Cardiac index">cardiac index</span>, renal 
blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, or filtration fraction. </p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>Therapeutic effects of 
quinapril appear to be the same for elderly ( ≥ 65 years of age) and younger 
adult patients given the same daily dosages, with no increase in adverse events 
in elderly patients. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, quinapril 10 to 40 mg was 
similar in effectiveness to captopril, enalapril, propranolol, and thiazide 
diuretics.</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>After oral 
administration of hydrochlorothiazide, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span> begins within 2 hours, peaks in 
about 4 hours, and lasts about 6 to 12 hours. Use of quinapril with a thiazide 
diuretic gives blood pressure lowering effect greater than that seen with either 
agent alone. In clinical trials of quinapril/hydrochlorothiazide using quinapril 
doses of 2.5 to 40 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 to 25 mg, the 
antihypertensive effects were sustained for at least 24 hours, and increased 
with increasing dose of either component. Although quinapril monotherapy is 
somewhat less effective in blacks than in non-blacks, the efficacy of 
combination therapy appears to be independent of race. By blocking the 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, administration of quinapril tends to reduce 
the potassium loss associated with the diuretic. In clinical trials of quinapril 
hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide, the average change in serum potassium was 
near zero when 2.5 to 40 mg of quinapril was combined with hydrochlorothiazide 
6.25 mg, and the average subject who received 10 to 20/12.5 to 25 mg experienced 
a milder reduction in serum potassium than that experienced by the average 
subject receiving the same dose of hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First"><a href="http://"></a><span class="Bold">Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions:</span> Presumably 
because angiotensin converting inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids

<p><a href="http://"></a>Quinapril hydrochloride 
and hydrochlorothiazide should be used cautiously in patients receiving 
concomitant therapy with other antihypertensives. The thiazide component of 
quinapril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide may potentiate the action of 
other antihypertensive drugs, especially ganglionic or peripheral 
adrenergic-blocking drugs. The antihypertensive effects of the thiazide 
component may also be enhanced in the postsympathectomy patients.</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>In patients at risk of 
excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, therapy with quinapril hydrochloride and 
hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be started under close medical supervision. 
Such patients should be followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and 
whenever the dosage of quinapril or diuretic is increased. Similar 
considerations may apply to patients with ischemic heart or cerebrovascular 
disease in whom an excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314171" conceptname="Low blood pressure reading">fall in blood pressure</span> could result in myocardial

<p><a href="http://"></a>If excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> 
occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position and, if necessary, 
treated with intravenous infusion of normal saline. Quinapril hydrochloride and 
hydrochlorothiazide treatment usually can be continued following restoration of 
blood pressure and volume. If symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> develops, a dose reduction 
or discontinuation of quinapril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide may be

repeated dosing may be cumulative.</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>When the

monitored during the first few weeks of therapy.</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>Some quinapril-treated 
hypertensive patients with no apparent pre-existing renal vascular diseases have

<p><a href="http://"></a>These adverse effects do 
not appear to have resulted from intrauterine ACE inhibitor exposure that has 
been limited to the first trimester. Mothers whose embryos and fetuses are 
exposed to ACE inhibitors only during the first trimester should be so informed. 
</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>Nonetheless, when

use of quinapril as soon as possible.</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>Rarely (probably less 
often than once in every thousand pregnancies), no alternative ACE inhibitors 
will be found. In these rare cases, the mothers should be apprised of the 
potential hazards to their fetuses, and serial ultrasound examinations should be 
performed to assess the intraamniotic environment.</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> is

<p><a href="http://"></a>Infants with histories

can increase the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span>. If concomitant use of such agents is 
indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient’s serum potassium 
should be monitored frequently.</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a><span class="Bold">Lithium:</span> Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium toxicity</span> have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during 
therapy with lithium. Because renal clearance of lithium is reduced by 
thiazides, the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium toxicity</span> is presumably raised further when, as in 
therapy with quinapril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide 
diuretic is coadministered with the ACE inhibitor. Quinapril hydrochloride and 
hydrochlorothiazide and lithium should be coadministered with caution, and 
frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a><span class="Bold">Tetracycline and Other Drugs That Interact with Magnesium:</span> 
Simultaneous administration of tetracycline with quinapril reduced the 
absorption of tetracycline by approximately 28% to 37%, possibly due to the high 
magnesium content in quinapril tablets. This interaction should be considered if 
coprescribing quinapril and tetracycline or other drugs that interact with 
magnesium.</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a><span class="Bold">Other 
Agents:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>Drug interaction studies 
of quinapril and other agents showed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple dose therapy with propranolol or cimetidine has no effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of single doses of quinapril. </li>
<li>The anticoagulant effect of a single dose of warfarin (measured by 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time) was not significantly changed by quinapril coadministration 
twice daily.</li>
<li>Quinapril treatment did not affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. </li>
<li>No <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interaction</span> was observed when single doses of quinapril 
and hydrochlorothiazide were administered concomitantly. </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://"></a>When administered 
concurrently, the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics. </p>

<li>Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics—potentiation of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span>

<li>Antidiabetic Drugs (oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin)—dosage adjustments 
of the antidiabetic drug may be required.</li>
<li>Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resin—absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is 
impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either 
cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its 
absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, 
respectively.</li>
<li>Corticosteroids, ACTH—intensified <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4077438" conceptname="Electrolyte depletion">electrolyte depletion</span>, particularly

<li>Pressor Amines (e.g., norepinephrine)—possible decreased response to pressor 
amines, but not sufficient to preclude their therapeutic use.</li>
<li>Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing (e.g., tubocurarine)—possible 
increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant.</li>
<li>Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs—the diuretic, natriuretic, and 
antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics may be reduced by concurrent 
administration of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents.</li>

<p><a href="http://"></a>Because of the potential 
for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from hydrochlorothiazide and 
the unknown effects of quinapril in infants, a decision should be made whether 
to discontinue nursing or to discontinue quinapril hydrochloride and

subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in 
responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection 
for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of 
the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal,

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"><a href="http://"></a>Quinapril hydrochloride 
and hydrochlorothiazide has been evaluated for safety in 1571 patients in 
controlled and uncontrolled studies. Of these, 498 were given quinapril plus 
hydrochlorothiazide for at least 1 year, with 153 patients extending combination 
therapy for over 2 years. In clinical trials with quinapril hydrochloride and 
hydrochlorothiazide, no adverse experience specific to the combination has been 
observed. Adverse experiences that have occurred have been limited to those that 
have been previously reported with quinapril or hydrochlorothiazide.</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>Adverse experiences were 
usually mild and transient, and there was no relationship between side effects 
and age, sex, race, or duration of therapy. Discontinuation of therapy because 
of adverse effects was required in 2.1% in patients in controlled studies. The 
most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with quinapril hydrochloride 
and hydrochlorothiazide were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> (1%; see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>) 
and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> (0.7%).</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>Adverse experiences 
probably or possibly related to therapy or of unknown relationship to therapy 
occurring in 1% or more of the 943 patients treated with quinapril plus 
hydrochlorothiazide in controlled trials are shown below.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First"><a href="http://"></a>No specific information 
is available on the treatment of overdosage with quinapril hydrochloride and 
hydrochlorothiazide or quinapril monotherapy; treatment should be symptomatic 
and supportive. Therapy with quinapril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide 
should be discontinued and the patient should be observed. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435796" conceptname="Dehydration">Dehydration</span>,

procedures.</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>The oral median lethal 
dose of quinapril/hydrochlorothiazide in combination ranges from 1063/664 to 
4640/2896 mg/kg in mice and rats. Doses of 1440 to 4280 mg/kg of quinapril cause 
significant lethality in mice and rats. In single-dose studies of 
hydrochlorothiazide, most rats survived doses up to 2.75 g/kg.</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>Data from human 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> of ACE inhibitors are scanty; the most likely manifestation of human 
quinapril overdosage is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>. In human hydrochlorothiazide <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, the 
most common signs and symptoms observed have been those of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435796" conceptname="Dehydration">dehydration</span> and

<p><a href="http://"></a>Laboratory 
determinations of serum levels of quinapril and its metabolites are not widely 
available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in 
the management of quinapril <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>.</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>No data are available to 
suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) 
that might accelerate elimination of quinapril and its metabolites. Hemodialysis 
and peritoneal dialysis have little effect on the elimination of quinapril and 
quinaprilat.</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>Angiotensin II could 
presumably serve as a specific antagonist-antidote in the setting of quinapril 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, but angiotensin II is essentially unavailable outside of scattered 
research facilities. Because the hypotensive effect of quinapril is achieved 
through vasodilation and effective <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436375" conceptname="Hypovolemia">hypovolemia</span>, it is reasonable to treat 
quinapril <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> by infusion of normal saline solution.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First"><a href="http://"></a>As individual 
monotherapy, quinapril is an effective treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> in once-daily 
doses of 10 to 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 to 50 
mg. In clinical trials of quinapril/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy 
using quinapril doses of 2.5 to 40 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 to 
25 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing dose of either 
component. </p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>The side effects (see 
<span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>) of quinapril are generally rare and apparently 
independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of 
dose-dependent phenomena (primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>) and dose-independent phenomena 
(e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192640" conceptname="Pancreatitis">pancreatitis</span>), the former much more common than the latter. Therapy with 
any combination of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide will be associated with 
both sets of dose-independent side effects, but regimens that combine low doses 
of hydrochlorothiazide with quinapril produce minimal effects on serum 
potassium. In clinical trials of quinapril hydrochloride and 
hydrochlorothiazide, the average change in serum potassium was near zero in 
subjects who received HCTZ 6.25 mg in the combination, and the average subject 
who received 10 to 40/12.5 to 25 mg experienced a milder reduction in serum 
potassium than that experienced by the average subject receiving the same dose 
of hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy. </p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>To minimize 
dose-independent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination 
therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with 
monotherapy. </p>
<p><a href="http://"></a><span class="Bold">Therapy 
Guided by Clinical Effect</span></p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>Patients whose blood 
pressures are not adequately controlled with quinapril monotherapy may instead 
be given quinapril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 10 mg/12.5 mg 
or 20 mg/12.5 mg. Further increases of either or both components could depend on 
clinical response. The hydrochlorothiazide dose should generally not be 
increased until 2 to 3 weeks have elapsed. Patients whose blood pressures are 
adequately controlled with 25 mg of daily hydrochloro-thiazide, but who 
experience significant potassium loss with this regimen, may achieve blood 
pressure control with less <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022093" conceptname="Electrolyte imbalance">electrolyte disturbance</span> if they are switched to 
quinapril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 10 mg/12.5 mg or 20 
mg/12.5 mg.</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a><span class="Bold">Replacement Therapy</span></p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>For convenience, 
patients who are adequately treated with 20 mg of quinapril and 25 mg of 
hydrochlorothiazide and experience no significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022093" conceptname="Electrolyte imbalance">electrolyte disturbances</span> may 
instead wish to receive quinapril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 
20 mg/25 mg.</p>

<p><a href="http://"></a>Regimens of therapy with 
quinapril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets need not take account of 
renal function as long as the patient’s creatinine clearance is &gt; 30 
mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span> (serum creatinine roughly ≤ 3 mg/dL or 265 
µmol/L). In patients with more severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, loop diuretics are 
preferred to thiazides. Therefore, quinapril hydrochloride and
