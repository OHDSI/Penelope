<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Methadone Hydrochloride Tablets USP for oral administration, each contain 5 mg or 10 mg of methadone hydrochloride.</p>
<p>Methadone hydrochloride is a white, crystalline material that is water-soluble.</p>
<p>Methadone hydrochloride is chemically described as 6-(dimethylamino)-4,4-diphenyl-3-heptanone hydrochloride. Methadone hydrochloride has a melting point of 235Â°C, and a pKa of 8.25 in water at 20Â°C. Its octanol/water partition coefficient at pH 7.4 is 117. A solution (1:100) in water has a pH between 4.5 and 6.5.</p>
<p>It has the following structural formula:</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="43679-0">
<a name="s9"></a><a name="section-2.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Methadone hydrochloride is a mu-agonist; a synthetic opioid analgesic with multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of morphine, the most prominent of which involves the central nervous system and organs composed of smooth muscle. The principal therapeutic uses for methadone are for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> and for detoxification or maintenance in opioid addiction. The methadone abstinence syndrome, although qualitatively similar to that of morphine, differs in that the onset is slower, the course is more prolonged, and the symptoms are less severe.</p>
<p>Some data also indicate that methadone acts as an antagonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. The contribution of NMDA receptor antagonism to methadone's efficacy is unknown. Other NMDA receptor antagonists have been shown to produce neurotoxic effects in animals.</p>

<a name="s11"></a><a name="section-2.2.1"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span>

                              â€“ Following oral administration the bioavailability of methadone ranges between 36 to 100% and peak plasma concentrations are achieved between 1 to 7.5 hours. Dose proportionality of methadone pharmacokinetics is not known. However, after administration of daily oral doses ranging from 10 to 225 mg, the steady-state plasma concentrations ranged between 65 to 630 ng/mL and the peak concentrations ranged between 124 to 1255 ng/mL. Effect of food on the bioavailability of methadone has not been evaluated.</p>

<a name="s12"></a><a name="section-2.2.2"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Distribution</span>

                              â€“ Methadone is a lipophilic drug and the steady-state volume of distribution ranges between 1.0 to 8.0 L/kg. In plasma, methadone is predominantly bound to Î±-acid glycoprotein (85% to 90%). Methadone is secreted in saliva, breast milk, amniotic fluid and umbilical cord plasma.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s13"></a><a name="section-2.2.3"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span>

                              â€“ Methadone is primarily metabolized by N-demethylation to an inactive metabolite, 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidene (EDDP). Cytochrome P450 enzymes, primarily CYP3A4, CYP2B6, and CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent CYP2C9 and CYP2D6, are responsible for conversion of methadone to EDDP and other inactive metabolites, which are excreted mainly in the urine.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s14"></a><a name="section-2.2.4"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Excretion</span>

                              â€“ The elimination of methadone is mediated by extensive biotransformation, followed by renal and fecal excretion. Published reports indicate that after multiple dose administration the terminal half-life (T<span class="Sub">1/2</span>) was highly variable and ranged between 8 to 59 hours in different studies. Since methadone is lipophilic, it has been known to persist in the liver and other tissues. The slow release from the liver and other tissues may prolong the duration of methadone action despite low plasma concentrations.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy</span>

                              â€“ The disposition of oral methadone has been studied in approximately 30 pregnant patients in 2nd and 3rd trimesters. Elimination of methadone was significantly changed in pregnancy. Total body clearance of methadone was increased in pregnant patients compared to the same patients postpartum or to non-pregnant opioid-dependent women. The terminal half-life of methadone is decreased during 2nd and 3rd trimesters. The decrease in plasma half-life and increased clearance of methadone resulting in lower methadone trough levels during pregnancy can lead to withdrawal symptoms in some pregnant patients. The dosage may need to be increased or the dosing interval decreased in pregnant patients receiving methadone (<span class="Italics">see</span><span class="Bold"><a href="#s66"> PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy,</a><a href="#s70"> Labor and Delivery,</a></span><span class="Italics"> and</span><span class="Bold"><a href="#s86"> DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>

Unmetabolized methadone and its metabolites are excreted in urine to a variable degree. Methadone is a basic (pKa=9.2) compound and the pH of the urinary tract can alter its disposition in plasma. Urine acidification has been shown to increase renal elimination of methadone. Forced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span>, peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, or charcoal hemoperfusion have not been established as beneficial for increasing the elimination of methadone or its metabolites.</p>

                        (<span class="Italics">see</span><span class="Bold"><a href="#s39"> PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</a></span>)</p>
<p>Methadone undergoes hepatic N-demethylation by cytochrome P-450 isoforms, principally CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9 and CYP2D6. Coadministration of methadone with inducers of these enzymes may result in more rapid methadone metabolism, and potentially, decreased effects of methadone. Conversely, administration with CYP inhibitors may reduce metabolism and potentiate methadone's effects. Pharmacokinetics of methadone may be unpredictable when coadministered with drugs that are known to both induce and inhibit CYP enzymes. Although antiretroviral drugs such as efavirenz, nelfinavir, nevirapine, ritonavir, lopinavir + ritonavir combination are known to inhibit some CYPs, they are shown to reduce the plasma levels of methadone, possibly due to their CYP induction activity. Therefore, drugs administered concomitantly with methadone should be evaluated for interaction potential; clinicians are advised to evaluate individual response to drug therapy before making a dosage adjustment.</p>

<h2>Cardiac Conduction Effects</h2>
<p class="First">Laboratory studies, both 
                       in vivo and in vitro, have demonstrated that methadone inhibits cardiac potassium channels and prolongs the QT interval. Cases of QT interval prolongation and serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135823" conceptname="Torsades de pointes">torsades de pointes</span>) have been observed during treatment with methadone. These cases appear to be more commonly associated with, but not limited to, higher dose treatment (&gt; 200 mg/day). Most cases involve patients being treated for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> with large, multiple daily doses of methadone, although cases have been reported in patients receiving doses commonly used for maintenance treatment of opioid addiction. In most of the cases seen at typical maintenance doses, concomitant medications and/or clinical conditions such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span> were noted as contributing factors. However, the evidence strongly suggests that methadone possesses the potential for adverse cardiac conduction effects in some patients.</p>
<p>Methadone should be administered with particular caution to patients already at risk for development of prolonged QT interval (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314658" conceptname="Cardiomegaly">cardiac hypertrophy</span>, concomitant diuretic use, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4098604" conceptname="Hypomagnesemia">hypomagnesemia</span>). Careful monitoring is recommended when using methadone in patients with a history of cardiac conduction abnormalities, those taking medications affecting cardiac conduction, and in other cases where history or physical exam suggest an increased risk of dysrhythmia. QT prolongation has also been reported in patients with no prior cardiac history who have received high doses of methadone. Patients developing QT prolongation while on methadone treatment should be evaluated for the presence of modifiable risk factors, such as concomitant medications with cardiac effects, drugs which might cause electrolyte abnormalities, and drugs which might act as inhibitors of methadone metabolism. For use of methadone to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, the risk of QT prolongation and development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">dysrhythmias</span> should be weighed against the benefit of adequate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> management and the availability of alternative therapies.</p>
<p>Methadone treatment for analgesic therapy in patients with acute or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436096" conceptname="Chronic pain">chronic pain</span> should only be initiated if the potential analgesic or palliative care benefit of treatment with methadone has been considered to outweigh the risk of QT prolongation that has been reported with high doses of methadone.</p>
<p>The use of methadone in patients already known to have a prolonged QT interval has not been systematically studied.</p>
<p>In using methadone an individualized benefit to risk assessment should be carried out and should include evaluation of patient presentation and complete medical history. For patients judged to be at risk, careful monitoring of cardiovascular status, including QT prolongation and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">dysrhythmias</span> and those described previously should be performed.</p>

<h2>Misuse, Abuse, and Diversion of Opioids</h2>
<p class="First">Methadone is a mu-agonist opioid with an abuse liability similar to that of morphine and is a Schedule II controlled substance. Methadone, like morphine and other opioids used for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, has the potential for being abused and is subject to criminal diversion.</p>
<p>Methadone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing methadone hydrochloride tablets in situations where the clinician is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion.</p>
<p>Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>.</p>

<h1>DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Methadone hydrochloride tablets contain methadone, a mu-agonist opioid with an abuse liability similar to other opioid agonists and is a Schedule II controlled substance. Methadone and other opioids used in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> can be abused and are subject to criminal diversion.</span></p>
<p>Abuse of methadone poses a risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. This risk is increased with concurrent abuse of methadone with alcohol and other substances. In addition, parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> and HIV.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug addiction</span> is characterized by compulsive use, use for non-medical purposes, and continued use despite harm or risk of harm. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug addiction</span> is a treatable disease, utilizing a multi-disciplinary approach, but relapse is common.</p>
<p>â€œDrug-seekingâ€? behavior is very common in addicts and drug abusers. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated claims of lost prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). â€œDoctor shoppingâ€? (visiting multiple prescribers) to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. However, it should be important to note that preoccupation with achieving adequate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> control.</p>

<h2>Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">Dependence</span> and Tolerance</h2>
<p class="First">Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction and is characterized by misuse for non-medical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. Methadone, like other opioids, has been diverted for non-medical use. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised.</p>
<p>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">When treating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, methadone given on a fixed-dose schedule may have a narrow therapeutic index in certain patient populations, especially when combined with other drugs, and should be reserved for cases where the benefits of opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> with methadone outweigh the known potential risks of cardiac conduction abnormalities, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, altered mental states and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span>.

<p>Selection of patients for treatment with methadone should be governed by the same principles that apply to the use of other opioids (<span class="Italics">see</span><span class="Bold"><a href="#s24"> INDICATIONS AND USAGE</a></span>). Physicians should individualize treatment in every case (<span class="Italics">see</span><span class="Bold"><a href="#s86"> DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>), taking into account the high degree of interpatient variability in response to and metabolism of methadone.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">
                        In vitro results suggest that methadone undergoes hepatic N-demethylation by cytochrome P450 enzymes, principally CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9 and CYP2D6. Coadministration of methadone with CYP inducers of these enzymes may result in a more rapid metabolism and potential for decreased effects of methadone, whereas administration with CYP inhibitors may reduce metabolism and potentiate methadone's effects. Although antiretroviral drugs such as efavirenz, nelfinavir, nevirapine, ritonavir, lopinavir + ritonavir combination are known to inhibit CYPs, they are shown to reduce the plasma levels of methadone, possibly due to their CYP induction activity. Therefore, drugs administered concomitantly with methadone should be evaluated for interaction potential; clinicians are advised to evaluate individual response to drug therapy.</p>

<h2>Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors</h2>
<p class="First">Since the metabolism of methadone is mediated primarily by CYP3A4 isozyme, coadministration of drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of methadone. The expected clinical results would be increased or prolonged opioid effects. Thus, methadone-treated patients coadministered strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as azole antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole) and macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), with methadone should be carefully monitored and dosage adjustment should be undertaken if warranted. Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g., sertraline, fluvoxamine) may increase methadone plasma levels upon coadministration with methadone and result in increased opiate effects and/or toxicity.</p>

Mice consumed 15 mg/kg/day or 60 mg/kg/day methadone for two years. These doses were approximately 0.6 and 2.5 times a human daily oral dose of 120 mg/day on a body surface area basis (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). There was a significant increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437251" conceptname="Benign neoplasm of pituitary gland and craniopharyngeal duct">pituitary adenomas</span> in female mice treated with 15 mg/kg/day but not with 60 mg/kg/day. Under the conditions of the assay, there was no clear evidence for a treatment-related increase in the incidence of neoplasms in male rats. Due to decreased food consumption in males at the high dose, male rats consumed 16 mg/kg/day and 28 mg/kg/day of methadone for two years. These doses were approximately 1.3 and 2.3 times a human daily oral dose of 120 mg/day, based on body surface area comparison. In contrast, female rats consumed 46 mg/kg/day or 88 mg/kg/day for two years. These doses were approximately 3.7 and 7.1 times a human daily oral dose of 120 mg/day, based on body surface area comparison. Under the conditions of the assay, there was no clear evidence for a treatment-related increase in the incidence of neoplasms in either male or female rats.</p>

Reductions in ejaculate volume and seminal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443720" conceptname="Blister">vesicle</span> and prostate secretions have been reported in methadone-treated individuals. In addition, reductions in serum testosterone levels and sperm motility, and abnormalities in sperm morphology have been reported. Published animal studies provide additional data indicating that methadone treatment of males can alter reproductive function. Methadone produces a significant regression of sex accessory organs and testes of male mice and rats. Additional data have been published indicating that methadone treatment of male rats (once a day for three consecutive days) increased embryolethality and neonatal mortality.

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Teratogenic Effects.</span><span class="Italics"> Pregnancy Category C</span>

                              â€“ There are no controlled studies of methadone use in pregnant women that can be used to establish safety. However, an expert review of published data on experiences with methadone use during pregnancy by the Teratogen Information System (TERIS) concluded that maternal use of methadone during pregnancy as part of a supervised, therapeutic regimen is unlikely to pose a substantial teratogenic risk (quantity and quality of data assessed as â€œlimited to fairâ€?). However, the data are insufficient to state that there is no risk (TERIS, last reviewed October, 2002). Pregnant women involved in methadone maintenance programs have been reported to have significantly improved prenatal care leading to significantly reduced incidence of obstetric and fetal complications and neonatal morbidity and mortality when compared to women using illicit drugs. Several factors complicate the interpretation of investigations of the children of women who take methadone during pregnancy. These include the maternal use of illicit drugs, other maternal factors such as nutrition, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, and psychosocial circumstances, limited information regarding dose and duration of methadone use during pregnancy, and the fact that most maternal exposure appears to occur after the first trimester of pregnancy. In addition, reported studies generally compare the benefit of methadone to the risk of untreated addiction to illicit drugs; the relevance of these findings to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> patients prescribed methadone during pregnancy is unclear.</p>
<p>Methadone has been detected in amniotic fluid and cord plasma at concentrations proportional to maternal plasma and in newborn urine at lower concentrations than corresponding maternal urine.</p>
<p>A retrospective series of 101 pregnant, opiate-dependent women who underwent inpatient opiate detoxification with methadone did not demonstrate any increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4067106" conceptname="Miscarriage">miscarriage</span> in the 2nd trimester or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4086393" conceptname="Premature delivery">premature delivery</span> in the 3rd trimester.</p>
<p>Several studies have suggested that infants born to narcotic-addicted women treated with methadone during all or part of pregnancy have been found to have decreased fetal growth with reduced birth weight, length, and/or head circumference compared to controls. This growth deficit does not appear to persist into later childhood. However, children born to women treated with methadone during pregnancy have been shown to demonstrate mild but persistent deficits in performance on psychometric and behavioral tests.</p>
<p>Additional information on the potential risks of methadone may be derived from animal data. Methadone does not appear to be teratogenic in the rat or rabbit models. However, following large doses, methadone produced teratogenic effects in the guinea pig, hamster and mouse. One published study in pregnant hamsters indicated that a single subcutaneous dose of methadone ranging from 31 to 185 mg/kg (the 31 mg/kg dose is approximately 2 times a human daily oral dose of 120 mg/day on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>

                              basis) on day 8 of gestation resulted in a decrease in the number of fetuses per litter and an increase in the percentage of fetuses exhibiting congenital malformations described as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4309376" conceptname="Exencephaly">exencephaly</span>, cranioschisis, and â€œvarious other lesionsâ€?. The majority of the doses tested also resulted in maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. In another study, a single subcutaneous dose of 22 to 24 mg/kg methadone (estimated exposure was approximately equivalent to a human daily oral dose of 120 mg/day on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>

                              basis) administered on day 9 of gestation in mice also produced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4309376" conceptname="Exencephaly">exencephaly</span> in 11% of the embryos.

The intensity of the syndrome does not always correlate with the maternal dose or the duration of maternal exposure. The duration of the withdrawal signs may vary from a few days to weeks or even months. There is no consensus on the appropriate management of infant withdrawal.</p>
<p>There are conflicting reports on whether <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435937" conceptname="Sudden infant death syndrome">SIDS</span> occurs with an increased incidence in infants born to women treated with methadone during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Abnormal fetal nonstress tests (NSTs) have been reported to occur more frequently when the test is performed 1 to 2 hours after a maintenance dose of methadone in late pregnancy compared to controls.</p>
<p>Published animal data have reported increased neonatal mortality in the offspring of male rodents that were treated with methadone prior to mating. In these studies, the female rodents were not treated with methadone, indicating paternally-mediated developmental toxicity. Specifically, methadone administered to the male rat prior to mating with methadone-naive females resulted in decreased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span> in progeny after weaning. The male progeny demonstrated reduced thymus weights, whereas the female progeny demonstrated increased adrenal weights. Further, behavioral testing of these male and female progeny revealed significant differences in behavioral tests compared to control animals, suggesting that paternal methadone exposure can produce physiological and behavioral changes in progeny in this model. Other animal studies have reported that perinatal exposure to opioids including methadone alters neuronal development and behavior in the offspring. Perinatal methadone exposure in rats has been linked to alterations in learning ability, motor activity, thermal regulation, nociceptive responses and sensitivity to drugs. Additional animal data demonstrates evidence for neurochemical changes in the brains of methadone-treated offspring, including changes to the cholinergic, dopaminergic, noradrenergic and serotonergic systems. Additional studies demonstrated that methadone treatment of male rats for 21 to 32 days prior to mating with methadone-naive females did not produce any adverse effects, suggesting that prolonged methadone treatment of the male rat resulted in tolerance to the developmental toxicities noted in the progeny. Mechanistic studies in this rat model suggest that the developmental effects of â€œpaternalâ€? methadone on the progeny appear to be due to decreased testosterone production. These animal data mirror the reported clinical findings of decreased testosterone levels in human males on methadone maintenance therapy for opioid addiction and in males receiving chronic intraspinal opioids.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Methadone is secreted into human milk. The safety of breast-feeding while taking oral methadone is controversial. At maternal oral doses of 10 to 80 mg/day, methadone concentrations from 50 to 570 mcg/L in milk have been reported, which, in the majority of samples, were lower than maternal serum drug concentrations at steady state. Peak methadone levels in milk occur approximately 4 to 5 hours after an oral dose. Based on an average milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day, an infant would consume approximately 17.4 mcg/kg/day which is approximately 2 to 3% of the oral maternal dose. Methadone has been detected in very low plasma concentrations in some infants whose mothers were taking methadone. Women on high-dose methadone maintenance, who are already breast-feeding, should be counseled to wean breast-feeding gradually in order to prevent neonatal abstinence syndrome.</p>
<p>Methadone-treated mothers considering nursing an opioid-naive infant should be counseled regarding the presence of methadone in breast milk.</p>
<p>Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from methadone, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. In patients being treated for opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>, this should include weighing the risk of methadone against the risk of maternal illicit drug use.</p>

<h2>Treatment</h2>
<p class="First">Primary attention should be given to the reestablishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. If a non-tolerant person, takes a large dose of methadone, effective opioid antagonists are available to counteract the potentially lethal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>. 
                        <span class="Bold">The physician must remember, however, that methadone is a long-acting depressant (36 to 48 hours), whereas opioid antagonists act for much shorter periods (one to three hours).</span>

                        The patient must, therefore, be monitored continuously for recurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> and may need to be treated repeatedly with the narcotic antagonist. If the diagnosis is correct and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> is due only to overdosage of methadone, the use of other respiratory stimulants is not indicated.</p>
<p>Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or cardiovascular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, the administration of the usual dose of an opioid antagonist may precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of this syndrome will depend on the degree of physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> and the dose of the antagonist administered. If antagonists must be used to treat serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> in the physically dependent patient, the antagonist should be administered with extreme care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.</p>
<p>Intravenously administered naloxone or nalmefene may be used to reverse signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>. Because of the relatively short half-life of naloxone as compared with methadone, repeated injections may be required until the status of the patient remains satisfactory. Naloxone may also be administered by continuous intravenous infusion.</p>
<p>Oxygen, intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and other supportive measures should be employed as indicated.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Methadone differs from many other opioid agonists in several important ways. Methadone's pharmacokinetic properties, coupled with high interpatient variability in its absorption, metabolism, and relative analgesic potency, necessitate a cautious and highly individualized approach to prescribing. 
                  <span class="Bold">Particular vigilance is necessary during treatment initiation, during conversion from one opioid to another, and during dose titration.</span></p>
<p>While methadone's duration of analgesic action (typically 4 to 8 hours) in the setting of single-dose studies approximates that of morphine, methadone's plasma elimination half-life is substantially longer than that of morphine (typically 8 to 59 hours vs. 1 to 5 hours). 
                  <span class="Bold">Methadone's peak respiratory depressant effects typically occur later, and persist longer than its peak <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effects</span>.</span>

                  Also, with repeated dosing, methadone may be retained in the liver and then slowly released, prolonging the duration of action despite low plasma concentrations. For these reasons, steady-state plasma concentrations, and full <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effects</span>, are usually not attained until 3 to 5 days of dosing. Additionally, incomplete cross-tolerance between mu-opioid agonists makes determination of dosing during opioid conversion complex.</p>
<p>The complexities associated with methadone dosing can contribute to cases of iatrogenic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, particularly during treatment initiation and dose titration. 
                  <span class="Bold">A high degree of "opioid tolerance" does not eliminate the possibility of methadone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, iatrogenic or otherwise. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Deaths</span> have been reported during conversion to methadone from chronic, high-dose treatment with other opioid agonists and during initiation of methadone treatment of addiction in subjects previously abusing high doses of other agonists.</span></p>

<h2>Treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">Pain</span></h2>
<p class="First">Optimal methadone initiation and dose titration strategies for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> have not been determined. Published equianalgesic conversion ratios between methadone and other opioids are 
                        <span class="Underline">imprecise</span>,

                         providing at best, only population averages that cannot be applied consistently to all patients. It should be noted that many commonly cited equianalgesia tables only present relative analgesic potencies of single opioid doses in non-tolerant patients, thus greatly underestimating methadone's analgesic potency, and its potential for adverse effects in repeated-dose settings. Regardless of the dose determination strategy employed, methadone is most safely initiated and titrated using small initial doses and gradual dose adjustments.</p>
<p>As with all opioid drugs, it is necessary to adjust the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's prior analgesic treatment experience. The following dosing recommendations should only be considered as suggested approaches to what is actually a series of clinical decisions over time in the management of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> of each individual patient. Prescribers should always follow appropriate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> management principles of careful assessment and ongoing monitoring.</p>
<p>In the selection of an initial dose of methadone hydrochloride tablets, attention should be given to the following:</p>
<ol class="Arabic">
<li>The total daily dose, potency and specific characteristics of the opioid the patient had been taking previously, if any;</li>
<li>The relative potency estimate used to calculate an equianalgesic starting methadone dose, in particular, whether it is intended for use in acute or chronic methadone dosing;</li>
<li>The patient's degree of opioid tolerance;</li>
<li>The age, general condition and medical status of the patient;</li>
<li>Concurrent medications, particularly other CNS and respiratory depressants;</li>
<li>The type, severity and expected duration of the patient's <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>;</li>
<li>The acceptable balance between <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> control and adverse side effects.</li>

<h2>Initiation of Therapy in Opioid Non-Tolerant Patients</h2>
<p class="First">When oral methadone is used as the first analgesic in patients who are not already being treated with, and tolerant to, opioids, the usual oral methadone starting dose is 2.5 mg to 10 mg every 8 to 12 hours, slowly titrated to effect. More frequent administration may be required during methadone initiation in order to maintain adequate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, and extreme caution is necessary to avoid overdosage, taking into account methadone's long elimination half-life.</p>

<h2>Switching Patients to Methadone from other Chronic Opioids</h2>
<p class="First">Switching a patient from another chronically administered opioid to methadone requires caution due to the uncertainty of dose conversion ratios and incomplete cross-tolerance. 
                        <span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Deaths</span> have occurred in opioid tolerant patients during conversion to methadone.</span></p>
<p>Conversion ratios in many commonly used equianalgesic dosing tables do not apply in the setting of repeated methadone dosing. Although with single-dose administration the onset and duration of analgesic action, as well as the analgesic potency of methadone and morphine, are similar methadone's potency increases over time with repeated dosing. Furthermore, the conversion ratio between methadone and other opiates varies dramatically depending on baseline opiate (morphine equivalent) use as shown in the table below.</p>
<p>The dose conversion scheme below is derived from various consensus guidelines for converting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436096" conceptname="Chronic pain">chronic pain</span> patients to methadone from morphine. Clinicians should consult published conversion guidelines to determine the equivalent morphine dose for patients converting from other opioids.</p>

Methadone conversion and dose titration methods should always be individualized to account for the patient's prior opioid exposure, general medical condition, concomitant medication, and anticipated breakthrough medication use. The endpoint of titration is achievement of adequate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relief, balanced against tolerability of opioid side effects. If a patient develops intolerable opioid related side effects, the methadone dose, or dosing interval, may need to be adjusted.</p>

<h2>Dosage Adjustment During Pregnancy</h2>
<p class="First">Methadone clearance may be increased during pregnancy. Several small studies have demonstrated significantly lower trough methadone plasma concentrations and shorter methadone half-lives in women during their pregnancy compared to after their delivery. During pregnancy a woman's methadone dose may need to be increased, or their dosing interval decreased. Methadone should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<h2>Induction/Initial Dosing</h2>
<p class="First">The initial methadone dose should be administered, under supervision, when there are no signs of sedation or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>, and the patient shows symptoms of withdrawal. Initially, a single dose of 20 to 30 mg of methadone will often be sufficient to suppress withdrawal symptoms. The initial dose should not exceed 30 mg. If same-day dosing adjustments are to be made, the patient should be asked to wait 2 to 4 hours for further evaluation, when peak levels have been reached. An additional 5 to 10 mg of methadone may be provided if withdrawal symptoms have not been suppressed or if symptoms reappear. The total daily dose of methadone on the first day of treatment should not ordinarily exceed 40 mg. Dose adjustments should be made over the first week of treatment based on control of withdrawal symptoms at the time of expected peak activity (e.g., 2 to 4 hours after dosing). Dose adjustment should be cautious; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> have occurred in early treatment due to the cumulative effects of the first several days' dosing. Patients should be reminded that the dose will â€œholdâ€? for a longer period of time as tissue stores of methadone accumulate.</p>
<p>Initial doses should be lower for patients whose tolerance is expected to be low at treatment entry. Loss of tolerance should be considered in any patient who has not taken opioids for more than 5 days. Initial doses should not be determined by previous treatment episodes or dollars spent per day on illicit drug use.</p>

<a name="s95"></a><a name="section-11.8"></a><p></p>
<h2>For Short-Term Detoxification</h2>
<p class="First">For patients preferring a brief course of stabilization followed by a period of medically supervised withdrawal, it is generally recommended that the patient be titrated to a total daily dose of about 40 mg in divided doses to achieve an adequate stabilizing level. Stabilization can be continued for 2 to 3 days, after which the dose of methadone should be gradually decreased. The rate at which methadone is decreased should be determined separately for each patient. </p>
<p>The dose of methadone can be decreased on a daily basis or at 2-day intervals, but the amount of intake should remain sufficient to keep withdrawal symptoms at a tolerable level. In hospitalized patients, a daily reduction of 20% of the total daily dose may be tolerated. In ambulatory patients, a somewhat slower schedule may be needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s96"></a><a name="section-11.9"></a><p></p>
<h2>For Maintenance Treatment</h2>
<p class="First">Patients in maintenance treatment should be titrated to a dose at which opioid symptoms are prevented for 24 hours, drug <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205415" conceptname="Hungry">hunger</span> or craving is reduced, the euphoric effects of self-administered opioids are blocked or attenuated, and the patient is tolerant to the sedative effects of methadone. Most commonly, clinical stability is achieved at doses between 80 to 120 mg/day.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s97"></a><a name="section-11.10"></a><p></p>
<h2>For Medically Supervised Withdrawal After a Period of Maintenance Treatment</h2>
<p class="First">There is considerable variability in the appropriate rate of methadone taper in patients choosing medically supervised withdrawal from methadone treatment. It is generally suggested that dose reductions should be less than 10% of the established tolerance or maintenance dose, and that 10 to 14-day intervals should elapse between dose reductions. Patients should be apprised of the high risk of relapse to illicit drug use associated with discontinuation of methadone maintenance treatment.</p>
