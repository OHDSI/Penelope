<p class="First"><span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS: Pregnancy</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Acitretin Capsules must not be used by females who are pregnant, or who intend to become pregnant during therapy or at any time for at least 3 years following discontinuation of therapy. Acitretin Capsules also must not be used by females who may not use reliable contraception while undergoing treatment and for at least 3 years following discontinuation of treatment. Acitretin is a metabolite of etretinate (TEGISON<span class="Sup">Â®</span>), and major human fetal abnormalities have been reported with the administration of acitretin and etretinate. Potentially, any fetus exposed can be affected.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Clinical evidence has shown that concurrent ingestion of acitretin and ethanol has been associated with the formation of etretinate, which has a significantly longer elimination half-life than acitretin. Because the longer elimination half-life of etretinate would increase the duration of teratogenic potential for female patients, ethanol must not be ingested by female patients of childbearing potential either during treatment with Acitretin Capsules or for 2 months after cessation of therapy. This allows for elimination of acitretin, thus removing the substrate for transesterification to etretinate. The mechanism of the metabolic process for conversion of acitretin to etretinate has not been fully defined. It is not known whether substances other than ethanol are associated with transesterification.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Acitretin has been shown to be embryotoxic and/or teratogenic in rabbits, mice, and rats at oral doses of 0.6, 3, and 15 mg per kg, respectively. These doses are approximately 0.2, 0.3, and 3 times the maximum recommended therapeutic dose, respectively, based on a mg-per-m<span class="Sup">2</span> comparison.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Major human fetal abnormalities associated with acitretin and/or etretinate administration have been reported including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212197" conceptname="Meningomyelocele">meningomyelocele</span>; meningoencephalocele; multiple synostoses; facial dysmorphia; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4162283" conceptname="Syndactyly">syndactyly</span>; absence of terminal phalanges; malformations of hip, ankle, and forearm; low-set ears; high palate; decreased cranial volume; cardiovascular malformation; and alterations of the skull and cervical vertebrae.</span></p>

<p><span class="Bold">Because of  the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> of Acitretin Capsules, a program called the <span class="Italics">Do Your P.A.R.T.</span> program, Pregnancy Prevention Actively Required During and After Treatment, has been developed to educate women of childbearing potential and their healthcare providers about the serious risks associated with acitretin and to help prevent pregnancies from occurring with the use of this drug and for 3 years after its discontinuation. The <span class="Italics">Do Your P.A.R.T. </span>program requirements are described below and program materials are available at www.soriatane.com/doyour-part-Program.html or may be requested by calling 1-888-784-3335 (1-888-STIEFEL) (see also PRECAUTIONS section).</span></p>

The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to pursue therapy with Acitretin Capsules. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) should be done during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of therapy with Acitretin Capsules. For patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443800" conceptname="Amenorrhea">amenorrhea</span>, the second test should be done at least 11 days after the last act of unprotected sexual intercourse (without using 2 effective forms of contraception [birth control] simultaneously).

Acitretin Capsules should be limited to a monthly supply.</span></dd>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd><span class="Bold">Must have a pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU per mL repeated every month during treatment with Acitretin Capsules.  The patient must have a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test before receiving a prescription for Acitretin Capsules. To encourage compliance with this recommendation, a monthly supply of the drug should be prescribed. For at least 3 years after discontinuing therapy with Acitretin Capsules, a pregnancy test must be repeated every 3 months.</span></dd>

Because this threshold has not been established for acitretin in humans and because elimination rates vary among patients, the duration of posttherapy contraception to achieve adequate elimination cannot be calculated precisely.

<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Acitretin Capsules (acitretin), a retinoid, are available in 10-mg and 25-mg gelatin capsules for oral administration. Chemically, acitretin is all-trans-9-(4-methoxy-2,3,6-trimethylphenyl)-3,7-dimethyl-2,4,6,8-nonatetraenoic acid. It is a metabolite of etretinate and is related to both retinoic acid and retinol (vitamin A). It is a yellow to greenish-yellow powder with a molecular weight of 326.44. The structural formula is:</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">The mechanism of action of Acitretin Capsules is unknown.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics: <span class="Italics">Absorption: </span></span>Oral absorption of acitretin is optimal when given with food. For this reason, acitretin was given with food in all of the following trials. After administration of a single 50-mg oral dose of acitretin to 18 healthy subjects, maximum plasma concentrations ranged from 196 to 728 ng per mL (mean: 416 ng per mL) and were achieved in 2 to 5 hours (mean: 2.7 hours). The oral absorption of acitretin is linear and proportional with increasing doses from 25 to 100 mg. Approximately 72% (range: 47% to 109%) of the administered dose was absorbed after a single 50-mg dose of acitretin was given to 12 healthy subjects.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Distribution: </span></span>Acitretin is more than 99.9% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Metabolism: (See Pharmacokinetic Drug Interactions: Ethanol.) </span></span>Following oral absorption, acitretin undergoes extensive metabolism and interconversion by simple isomerization to its 13-cis form (cis-acitretin). The formation of cis-acitretin relative to parent compound is not altered by dose or fed/fast conditions of oral administration of acitretin. Both parent compound and isomer are further metabolized into chain-shortened breakdown products and conjugates, which are excreted. Following multiple-dose administration of acitretin, steady-state concentrations of acitretin and cis-acitretin in plasma are achieved within approximately 3 weeks.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Elimination: </span></span>The chain-shortened metabolites and conjugates of acitretin and cis-acitretin are ultimately excreted in the feces (34% to 54%) and urine (16% to 53%). The terminal elimination half-life of acitretin following multiple-dose administration is 49 hours (range: 33 to 96 hours), and that of cis-acitretin under the same conditions is 63 hours (range: 28 to 157 hours). The accumulation ratio of the parent compound is 1.2; that of cis-acitretin is 6.6. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Special Populations: <span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">Psoriasis</span>: </span></span>In an 8-week trial of acitretin pharmacokinetics in subjects with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span>, mean steady-state trough concentrations of acitretin increased in a dose-proportional manner with dosages ranging from 10 to 50 mg daily. Acitretin plasma concentrations were nonmeasurable (&lt;4 ng per mL) in all subjects 3 weeks after cessation of therapy.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Elderly: </span></span>In a multiple-dose trial in healthy young (n = 6) and elderly (n = 8) subjects, a 2-fold increase in acitretin plasma concentrations were seen in elderly subjects, although the elimination half-life did not change.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Failure</span>: </span></span>Plasma concentrations of acitretin were significantly (59.3%) lower in subjects with end-stage <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> (n = 6) when compared with age-matched controls, following single 50-mg oral doses. Acitretin was not removed by hemodialysis in these subjects.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Pharmacokinetic Drug Interactions (see also boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions): </span></span>In studies of in vivo pharmacokinetic drug interactions, no interaction was seen between acitretin and cimetidine, digoxin, phenprocoumon, or glyburide.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Ethanol: </span></span>Clinical evidence has shown that etretinate (a retinoid with a much longer half-life, see below) can be formed with concurrent ingestion of acitretin and ethanol. In a 2-way crossover trial, all 10 subjects formed etretinate with concurrent ingestion of a single 100-mg oral dose of acitretin during a 3-hour period of ethanol ingestion (total ethanol, approximately 1.4Â g per kg body weight). A mean peak etretinate concentration of 59 ng per mL (range 22 to 105 ng per mL) was observed, and extrapolation of AUC values indicated that the formation of etretinate in this trial was comparable to a single 5-mg oral dose of etretinate. There was no detectable formation of etretinate when a single 100-mg oral dose of acitretin was administered without concurrent ethanol ingestion, although the formation of etretinate without concurrent ethanol ingestion cannot be excluded (see boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS). Of 93 evaluable psoriatic subjects on acitretin therapy in several foreign trials (10 to 80 mg per day), 16% had measurable etretinate levels (&gt;5 ng per mL).</p>
<p>Etretinate has a much longer elimination half-life compared with that of acitretin. In one trial the apparent mean terminal half-life after 6 months of therapy was approximately 120 days (range: 84 to 168 days). In another trial of 47 subjects treated chronically with etretinate, 5 had detectable serum drug levels (in the range of 0.5 to 12 ng per mL) 2.1 to 2.9 years after therapy was discontinued. The long half-life appears to be due to storage of etretinate in adipose tissue.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Progestin-only Contraceptives: </span></span>It has not been established if there is a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interaction</span> between acitretin and combined oral contraceptives.

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Acitretin Capsules are indicated for the treatment of severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span> in adults. Because of significant adverse effects associated with their use, Acitretin Capsules should be prescribed only by those knowledgeable in the systemic use of retinoids. In females of reproductive potential, Acitretin Capsules should be reserved for non-pregnant patients who are unresponsive to other therapies or whose clinical condition contraindicates the use of other treatments (see boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS â€”Acitretin Capsules can cause severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span>).</p>
<p>Most patients experience relapse of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span> after discontinuing therapy. Subsequent courses, when clinically indicated, have produced efficacy results similar to the initial course of therapy.</p>

<h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS </h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category X: (See boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS.)</span></p>
<p>Acitretin Capsules are contraindicated in patients with severely impaired liver or kidney function and in patients with chronic abnormally elevated blood lipid values (see boxed WARNINGS: Hepatotoxicity, WARNINGS: Lipids and Possible Cardiovascular Effects, and PRECAUTIONS).</p>
<p>An increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> has been reported to result from combined use of methotrexate and etretinate. Consequently, the combination of methotrexate with Acitretin Capsules is also contraindicated (see PRECAUTIONS: <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions</span>).</p>
<p>Since both Acitretin Capsules and tetracyclines can cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154803" conceptname="Raised intracranial pressure">increased intracranial pressure</span>, their combined use is contraindicated (see WARNINGS: <span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312902" conceptname="Benign intracranial hypertension">Pseudotumor Cerebri</span></span>).</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Acitretin Capsules are contraindicated in cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432791" conceptname="Angioedema">angioedema</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="139900" conceptname="Urticaria">urticaria</span>) to the preparation (acitretin or excipients) or to other retinoids.</span></p>

Liver function test results in these subjects returned to normal after Acitretin Capsules were discontinued. Two of the 1,289 subjects treated in European clinical trials developed biopsy-confirmed toxic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span>. A second biopsy in one of these subjects revealed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4101098" conceptname="Nodule">nodule</span> formation suggestive of cirrhosis. One subject in a Canadian clinical trial of 63 subjects developed a 3-fold increase of transaminases.

The subjectâ€™s transaminase levels returned to normal 2 months after Acitretin Capsules were discontinued.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">The potential of therapy with Acitretin Capsules to induce hepatotoxicity was prospectively evaluated using liver biopsies in an open-label trial of 128 subjects.

A comparison of liver biopsy findings before and after therapy revealed 49 (58%) subjects showed no change, 21 (25%) improved, and 14 (17%) subjects had a worsening of their liver biopsy status.

<p><span class="Bold">Skeletal Abnormalities:</span> In adults receiving long-term treatment with Acitretin Capsules, appropriate examinations should be periodically performed in view of possible ossification abnormalities (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Because the frequency and severity of iatrogenic bony abnormality in adults is low, periodic radiography is only warranted in the presence of symptoms or long-term use of Acitretin Capsules. If such disorders arise, the continuation of therapy should be discussed with the patient on the basis of a careful risk/benefit analysis. In clinical trials with Acitretin Capsules, subjects were prospectively evaluated for evidence of development or change in bony abnormalities of the vertebral column, knees, and ankles.</p>
<p>Of 380 subjects treated with Acitretin Capsules, 15% had preexisting abnormalities of the spine which showed new changes or progression of preexisting findings. Changes included degenerative spurs, anterior bridging of spinal vertebrae, diffuse idiopathic skeletal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="72715" conceptname="Exostosis">hyperostosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4344496" conceptname="Calcification of ligament">ligament calcification</span> and narrowing and destruction of a cervical disc space. De novo changes (formation of small spurs) were seen in 3 subjects after 1Â½ to 2Â½ years.</p>
<p>Six of 128 subjects treated with Acitretin Capsules showed abnormalities in the knees and ankles before treatment that progressed during treatment. In 5, these changes involved the formation of additional spurs or enlargement of existing spurs. The sixth subject had <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80180" conceptname="Osteoarthritis">degenerative joint disease</span> which worsened. No subjects developed spurs de novo. Clinical complaints did not predict radiographic changes.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Lipids and Possible Cardiovascular Effects: </span>Blood lipid determinations should be performed before Acitretin Capsules are administered and again at intervals of 1 to 2 weeks until the lipid response to the drug is established, usually within 4 to 8 weeks. In subjects receiving Acitretin Capsules during clinical trials, 66% and 33% experienced elevation in triglycerides and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>, respectively. Decreased high density lipoproteins (HDL) occurred in 40% of subjects. These effects of Acitretin Capsules were generally reversible upon cessation of therapy.</p>
<p>Subjects with an increased tendency to develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440360" conceptname="Pure hyperglyceridemia">hypertriglyceridemia</span> included those with disturbances of lipid metabolism, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433736" conceptname="Obesity">obesity</span>, increased alcohol intake, or a familial history of these conditions. Because of the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440360" conceptname="Pure hyperglyceridemia">hypertriglyceridemia</span>, serum lipids must be more closely monitored in high-risk patients and during long-term treatment.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440360" conceptname="Pure hyperglyceridemia">Hypertriglyceridemia</span> and lowered HDL may increase a patientâ€™s cardiovascular risk status.

In addition, elevation of serum triglycerides to greater than 800 mg per dL has been associated with fatal fulminant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192640" conceptname="Pancreatitis">pancreatitis</span>. Therefore, dietary modifications, reduction in dose of Acitretin Capsules, or drug therapy should be employed to control significant elevations of triglycerides. If, despite these measures, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440360" conceptname="Pure hyperglyceridemia">hypertriglyceridemia</span> and low HDL levels persist, the discontinuation of Acitretin Capsules should be considered.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Ophthalmologic Effects:</span> The eyes and vision of 329 subjects treated with Acitretin Capsules were examined by ophthalmologists.

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">A description of the <span class="Italics">Do Your P.A.R.T.</span> materials is provided below.  The main goals of the materials are to explain the program requirements, to reinforce the educational messages, and to assess program effectiveness.</p>
<p>The <span class="Italics">Do Your P.A.R.T.</span> booklet includes:</p>
<dl>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>The Do Your P.A.R.T. Patient Brochure: information on the program requirements, risks of acitretin, and the types of contraceptive methods</dd>
<dt>â€¢</dt>

<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>The Patient Agreement/Informed Consent for Female Patients form</dd>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>Medication Guide</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <span class="Italics">Do Your P.A.R.T.</span> program also includes a voluntary patient survey for women of childbearing potential to assess the effectiveness of the Acitretin Capsules Pregnancy Prevention Program <span class="Italics">Do Your P.A.R.T. Do Your P.A.R.T </span>Program materials are available at www.soriatane.com/doyour-part-Program.html or may be requested by calling 1-888-784-3335 (1-888-STIEFEL).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Information for Patients: </span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">(See Medication Guide for all patients and Patient Agreement/Informed Consent for Female Patients at end of professional labeling).</span></p>
<p>Patients should be instructed to read the Medication Guide supplied as required by law when Acitretin Capsules are dispensed.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Females of Reproductive Potential: </span>Acitretin Capsules can cause severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span>.</span> Female patients must not be pregnant when therapy with Acitretin Capsules is initiated, they must not become pregnant while taking Acitretin Capsules, and for at least 3 years after stopping Acitretin Capsules, so that the drug can be eliminated to below a blood concentration that would be associated with an increased incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span>. Because this threshold has not been established for acitretin in humans and because elimination rates vary among patients, the duration of posttherapy contraception to achieve adequate elimination cannot be calculated precisely (see boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Females of reproductive potential should also be advised that they must not ingest beverages or products containing ethanol while taking Acitretin Capsules and for 2 months after Acitretin Capsules have been discontinued.</span> This allows for elimination of the acitretin which can be converted to etretinate in the presence of alcohol.</p>
<p>Female patients should be advised that any method of birth control can fail, including tubal ligation, and that microdosed progestin â€œminipillâ€? preparations are <span class="Italics">not </span>recommended for use with Acitretin Capsules (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetic Drug Interactions). Data from one patient who received a very low-dosed progestin contraceptive (levonorgestrel 0.03 mg) had a significant increase of the progesterone level after 3 menstrual cycles during acitretin treatment.<span class="Sup">2</span></p>
<p>Female patients should sign a consent form prior to beginning therapy with Acitretin Capsules (see boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS).</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Nursing Mothers: </span></span>Studies on lactating rats have shown that etretinate is excreted in the milk. There is one prospective case report where acitretin is reported to be excreted in human milk. Therefore, nursing mothers should not receive Acitretin Capsules prior to or during nursing because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">All Patients: </span><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> and/or other <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4294810" conceptname="Psychiatric symptom">psychiatric symptoms</span> such as aggressive feelings or thoughts of self-harm have been reported.</span> These events, including selfâ€‘injurious behavior, have been reported in patients taking other systemically administered retinoids, as well as in patients taking Acitretin Capsules. Since other factors may have contributed to these events, it is not known if they are related to Acitretin Capsules. Patients should be counseled to stop taking Acitretin Capsules and notify their prescriber immediately if they experience <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4294810" conceptname="Psychiatric symptom">psychiatric symptoms</span>.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised that a transient worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span> is sometimes seen during the initial treatment period. Patients should be advised that they may have to wait 2 to 3 months before they get the full benefit of Acitretin Capsules, although some patients may achieve significant improvements within the first 8 weeks of treatment as demonstrated in clinical trials.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="374037" conceptname="Night blindness">Decreased night vision</span> has been reported during therapy with Acitretin Capsules. Patients should be advised of this potential problem and warned to be cautious when driving or operating any vehicle at night. Visual problems should be carefully monitored (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Patients should be advised that they may experience decreased tolerance to contact lenses during the treatment period and sometimes after treatment has stopped.</p>
<p>Patients should not donate blood during and for at least 3 years following therapy because Acitretin Capsules can cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span> and women of childbearing potential must not receive blood from patients being treated with Acitretin Capsules.</p>
<p>Because of the relationship of Acitretin Capsules to vitamin A, patients should be advised against taking vitamin A supplements in excess of minimum recommended daily allowances to avoid possible additive toxic effects.</p>
<p>Patients should avoid the use of sun lamps and excessive exposure to sunlight (non-medical UV exposure) because the effects of UV light are enhanced by retinoids.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Patients should be advised that they must not give their Acitretin Capsules to any other person. </span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">For Prescribers: </span></span>Acitretin Capsules have not been studied in and are not indicated for treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="141095" conceptname="Acne">acne</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Phototherapy: </span></span>Significantly lower doses of phototherapy are required when Acitretin Capsules are used because effects on the stratum corneum induced by Acitretin Capsules can increase the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span> (burning) (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions: <span class="Italics">Ethanol: </span></span>Clinical evidence has shown that etretinate can be formed with concurrent ingestion of acitretin and ethanol (see boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics).</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Glyburide: </span></span>In a trial of 7 healthy male volunteers, acitretin treatment potentiated the blood glucose-lowering effect of glyburide (a sulfonylurea similar to chlorpropamide) in 3 of the 7 subjects. Repeating the trial with 6 healthy male volunteers in the absence of glyburide did not detect an effect of acitretin on glucose tolerance. Careful supervision of diabetic patients under treatment with Acitretin Capsules is recommended (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hormonal Contraceptives:</span></span>It has not been established if there is a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interaction</span> between acitretin and combined oral contraceptives. However, it has been established that acitretin interferes with the contraceptive effect of microdosed progestin â€œminipillâ€? preparations. Microdosed â€œminipillâ€? progestin preparations are not recommended for use with Acitretin Capsules (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetic Drug Interactions). <span class="Italics">It is not known whether other progestin-only contraceptives, such as implants and injectables, are adequate methods of contraception during acitretin therapy.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Methotrexate: </span></span>An increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> has been reported to result from combined use of methotrexate and etretinate. Consequently, the combination of methotrexate with acitretin is also contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Phenytoin: </span></span>If acitretin is given concurrently with phenytoin, the protein binding of phenytoin may be reduced.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Tetracyclines: </span></span>Since both acitretin and tetracyclines can cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154803" conceptname="Raised intracranial pressure">increased intracranial pressure</span>, their combined use is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312902" conceptname="Benign intracranial hypertension">Pseudotumor Cerebri</span>).</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Vitamin A and Oral Retinoids: </span></span>Concomitant administration of vitamin A and/or other oral retinoids with acitretin must be avoided because of the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436941" conceptname="Hypervitaminosis A">hypervitaminosis A</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Other: </span></span>There appears to be no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interaction</span> between acitretin and cimetidine, digoxin, or glyburide. Investigations into the effect of acitretin on the protein binding of anticoagulants of the coumarin type (warfarin) revealed no interaction.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Laboratory Tests:</span> If significant abnormal laboratory results are obtained, either dosage reduction with careful monitoring or treatment discontinuation is recommended, depending on clinical judgment.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Blood Sugar: </span></span>Some patients receiving retinoids have experienced problems with blood sugar control. In addition, new cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> have been diagnosed during retinoid therapy, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443727" conceptname="Diabetic ketoacidosis">diabetic ketoacidosis</span>. In diabetics, blood-sugar levels should be monitored very carefully. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Lipids: </span></span>In clinical trials, the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440360" conceptname="Pure hyperglyceridemia">hypertriglyceridemia</span> was 66%, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437827" conceptname="Pure hypercholesterolemia">hypercholesterolemia</span> was 33%, and that of decreased HDL was 40%. Pretreatment and follow-up measurements should be obtained under fasting conditions. It is recommended that these tests be performed weekly or every other week until the lipid response to Acitretin Capsules has stabilized (see WARNINGS).</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Liver Function Tests: </span></span>Elevations of AST (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4094657" conceptname="Aspartate aminotransferase">SGOT</span>), ALT (SGPT), or LDH were experienced by approximately 1 in 3 patients treated with Acitretin Capsules. It is recommended that these tests be performed prior to initiation of therapy with Acitretin Capsules, at 1- to 2-week intervals until stable, and thereafter at intervals as clinically indicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and boxed WARNINGS).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: <span class="Italics">Carcinogenesis: </span></span>A carcinogenesis study of acitretin in Wistar rats, at doses up to 2 mg per kg per day administered 7 days per week for 104 weeks, has been completed. There were no neoplastic lesions observed that were considered to have been related to treatment with acitretin. An 80-week carcinogenesis study in mice has been completed with etretinate, the ethyl ester of acitretin. Blood level data obtained during this study demonstrated that etretinate was metabolized to acitretin and that blood levels of acitretin exceeded those of etretinate at all times studied. In the etretinate study, an increased incidence of blood vessel tumors (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441818" conceptname="Hemangioma">hemangiomas</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4297200" conceptname="Angiosarcoma">hemangiosarcomas</span> at several different sites) was noted in male, but not female, mice at doses approximately one-half the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on a mg-per-m<span class="Sup">2</span> comparison.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Mutagenesis: </span></span>Acitretin was evaluated for mutagenic potential in the Ames test, in the Chinese hamster (V79/HGPRT) assay, in unscheduled DNA synthesis assays using rat hepatocytes and human fibroblasts, and in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. No evidence of mutagenicity of acitretin was demonstrated in any of these assays.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Impairment of Fertility: </span></span>In a fertility study in rats, the fertility of treated animals was not impaired at the highest dosage of acitretin tested, 3 mg per kg per day (approximately one-half the maximum recommended therapeutic dose based on a mg-per-m<span class="Sup">2</span> comparison). Chronic toxicity studies in dogs revealed testicular changes (reversible mild to moderate spermatogenic arrest and appearance of multinucleated giant cells) in the highest dosage group (50 then 30 mg per kg per day).</p>
<p>No decreases in sperm count or concentration and no changes in sperm motility or morphology were noted in 31 men (17 psoriatic subjects, 8 subjects with disorders of keratinization and 6 healthy volunteers) given 30 to 50 mg per day of acitretin for at least 12 weeks. In these trials, no deleterious effects were seen on either testosterone production, LH, or FSH in any of the 31 men.<span class="Sup">4-6</span> No deleterious effects were seen on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis in any of the 18 men where it was measured.<span class="Sup">4,5</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy: <span class="Italics">Teratogenic Effects: </span>Pregnancy Category X (see boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS).</span></p>
<p>In a study in which acitretin was administered to male rats only at a dosage of 5 mg per kg per day for 10 weeks (approximate duration of one spermatogenic cycle) prior to and during mating with untreated female rats, no teratogenic effects were observed in the progeny (see boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS for information about male use of Acitretin Capsules).</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Nonteratogenic Effects: </span></span>In rats dosed at 3 mg per kg per day (approximately one-half the maximum recommended therapeutic dose based on a mg-per-m<span class="Sup">2</span> comparison), slightly decreased pup survival and delayed incisor <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">eruption</span> were noted. At the next lowest dose tested, 1 mg per kg per day, no treatment-related adverse effects were observed.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use:</span> Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. No clinical trials have been conducted in pediatric subjects. Ossification of interosseous ligaments and tendons of the extremities, skeletal hyperostoses, decreases in bone mineral density, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232188" conceptname="Premature epiphyseal closure">premature epiphyseal closure</span> have been reported in children taking other systemic retinoids, including etretinate, a metabolite of acitretin. A causal relationship between these effects and acitretin has not been established. While it is not known that these occurrences are more severe or more frequent in children, there is special concern in pediatric patients because of the implications for growth potential (see WARNINGS: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="72715" conceptname="Exostosis">Hyperostosis</span>).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Geriatric Use:</span> Clinical trials of Acitretin Capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A 2-fold increase in acitretin plasma concentrations was seen in healthy elderly subjects compared with young subjects, although the elimination half-life did not change (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations).</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436941" conceptname="Hypervitaminosis A">Hypervitaminosis A</span> produces a wide spectrum of signs and symptoms primarily of the mucocutaneous, musculoskeletal, hepatic, neuropsychiatric, and central nervous systems.

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">There is intersubject variation in the pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and incidence of side effects with Acitretin Capsules. A number of the more common side effects are dose-related. Individualization of dosage is required to achieve sufficient therapeutic response while minimizing side effects. Therapy with Acitretin Capsules should be initiated at 25 to 50 mg per day, given as a single dose with the main meal. Maintenance doses of 25 to 50 mg per day may be given dependent upon an individual patientâ€™s response to initial treatment. Relapses may be treated as outlined for initial therapy.</p>
<p>When Acitretin Capsules are used with phototherapy, the prescriber should decrease the phototherapy dose, dependent on the patientâ€™s individual response (see PRECAUTIONS: <span class="Italics">General</span>).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Females who have taken TEGISON (etretinate) must continue to follow the contraceptive recommendations for TEGISON. TEGISON is no longer marketed in the US; for information, call Stiefel at 1-888-784-3335 (1-888-STIEFEL).</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Information for Pharmacists: </span>Acitretin Capsules must only be dispensed in no more than a monthly supply. An Acitretin Capsules Medication Guide must be given to the patient each time Acitretin Capsules are dispensed, as required by law.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">3. </span>I know that I must avoid all alcohol, including drinks, food, medicines, and over-the-counter products that contain alcohol. I understand that the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span> may last longer than 3 years if I swallow any form of alcohol during therapy with Acitretin Capsules, and for 2 months after I stop taking Acitretin Capsules.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">4. </span>I understand that I must not have sexual intercourse, or I must use 2 separate, effective forms of birth control <span class="Bold">at the same time. </span>The only exceptions are if I have had surgery to remove the womb (a hysterectomy) or my prescriber has told me I have gone completely through <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span>.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">5. </span>I understand that I have to use 2 effective forms of birth control (contraception) at the same time for at least 1 month before starting Acitretin Capsules, for the entire time of therapy with Acitretin Capsules, and for at least 3 years after stopping Acitretin Capsules.</p>
<p>INITIAL: ___________</p>
<p><span class="Bold">6. </span>I understand that any form of birth control can fail. Therefore, I must use 2 different methods at the same time, every time I have sexual intercourse.</p>
<p>INITIAL: ___________</p>
<p><span class="Bold">7. </span>I understand that the following are considered effective forms of birth control: Primary: Tubal ligation (having my tubes tied), partnerâ€™s vasectomy, birth control pills (not progestin-only â€œminipillsâ€?), injectable/implantable/insertable/topical (patch) hormonal birth control products, and IUDs (intrauterine devices). Secondary: Condoms (with or without spermicide, which is a special cream or jelly that kills sperm), diaphragms and cervical caps (which must be used with a spermicide), and vaginal sponges (contains spermicide). I understand that at least 1 of my 2 methods of birth control must be a primary method.</p>
<p>INITIAL: ___________</p>
<p><span class="Bold">8. </span>I will talk with my prescriber about any medicines or dietary supplements I plan to take while taking Acitretin Capsules because certain birth control methods may not work if I am taking certain medicines or herbal products (for example, St. Johnâ€™s wort).</p>

<p><span class="Bold">9. </span>Unless I have had a hysterectomy or my prescriber says I have gone completely through <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span>, I understand that I must have 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4094448" conceptname="Pregnancy test negative">negative pregnancy test</span> results before I can get a prescription to start Acitretin Capsules. I understand that if the second pregnancy test is negative, I must start taking my Acitretin Capsules within 7 days of the specimen collection.

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">ACITRETIN CAPSULES</span></p>
<p>Read this Medication Guide carefully before you start taking Acitretin Capsules and read it each time you get more Acitretin Capsules. There may be new information.</p>
<p>The first information in this Guide is about <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span> and how to avoid pregnancy. <span class="Bold">After this section there is important safety information about possible effects for any patient taking Acitretin Capsules.</span> ALL patients should read this entire Medication Guide carefully.</p>
<p>This information does not take the place of talking with your prescriber about your medical condition or treatment.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Underline">What is the most important information I should know about Acitretin Capsules?</span></span></p>

<dd><span class="Bold">Before you receive your first Acitretin Capsules prescription, you should have discussed and signed a Patient Agreement/Informed Consent for Female Patients form with your prescriber. This is to help make sure you understand the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span> and how to avoid getting pregnant.

<span class="Bold">Consider â€œEmergency Contraceptionâ€?

Contact your prescriber <span class="Bold">as soon as possible</span> if you have sex without using 2 effective forms of birth control (contraception) at the same time, because EC works best if it is used within 1 or 2Â days after sex. EC is not a replacement for your usual 2 effective forms of birth control (contraception) because it is not as effective as regular birth control methods. You can get EC from private doctors or nurse practitioners, womenâ€™s health centers, or hospital emergency rooms.

<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Underline">What should males know before taking Acitretin Capsules? </span></span></p>
<p>Small amounts of Acitretin are found in the semen of males taking Acitretin Capsules. Based upon available information, it appears that these small amounts of Acitretin in semen pose little, if any, risk to an unborn child while a male patient is taking the drug or after it is discontinued.

<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Underline">What are Acitretin Capsules?</span></span></p>
<p>Acitretin Capsules are a medicine used to treat severe forms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span> in adults. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">Psoriasis</span> is a skin disease that causes cells in the outer layer of the skin to grow faster than normal and pile up on the skinâ€™s surface. In the most common type of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span>, the skin becomes inflamed and produces red, thickened areas, often with silvery scales. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Because Acitretin Capsules can have serious side effects,</span> you should talk with your prescriber about whether Acitretin Capsulesâ€™ possible benefits outweigh their possible risks.</p>
<p>Acitretin Capsules may not work right away. You may have to wait 2 to 3 months before you get the full benefit of Acitretin Capsules. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">Psoriasis</span> gets worse for some patients when they first start Acitretin Capsules treatment. </p>
