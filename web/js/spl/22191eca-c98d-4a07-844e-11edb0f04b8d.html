<h1>DESCRIPTION </h1>
<p class="First">Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (estradiol gel) 0.1% is a clear, colorless gel, which is odorless when dry.  It is designed to deliver sustained circulating concentrations of estradiol when applied once daily to the skin.  The gel is applied to a small area (200 cm<span class="Sup">2</span>) of the thigh in a thin, quick-drying layer.  Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span> is available in three doses of 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 g for topical application (corresponding to 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg estradiol, respectively). </p>
<p>The active component of the topical gel is estradiol. </p>
<p>Estradiol is a white crystalline powder, chemically described as estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17Î²-diol.  It has an empirical formula of C<span class="Sub">18</span>H<span class="Sub">24</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span> and molecular weight of 272.39.  The structural formula is: </p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY </h1>
<p class="First">Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span> provides estrogen therapy by delivering estradiol, the major estrogenic hormone secreted by the human ovary, to the systemic circulation following topical application. </p>
<p>Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics.  Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level. </p>
<p>The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle.  After <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span>, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone by peripheral tissues.  Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women. </p>
<p>Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues.  To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified.  These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue. </p>
<p>Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), through a negative feedback mechanism.  Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women. </p>

<h3>A. Â  Â  Â Absorption </h3>
<p class="First">Estradiol diffuses across intact skin and into the systemic circulation by a passive absorption process, with diffusion across the stratum corneum being the rate-limiting factor. </p>
<p>In a 14-day, Phase 1, multiple-dose study, Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span> demonstrated linear and approximately dose-proportional estradiol pharmacokinetics at steady state for both AUC<span class="Sub">0-24</span> and C<span class="Sub">max</span> following once daily dosing to the skin of either the right or left upper thigh (<a href="#t1">Table 1</a>). </p>

<h3>B. Â  Â  Â Distribution </h3>
<p class="First">The distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens.  Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs.  Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4206320" conceptname="Sex steroid binding globulin">sex hormone binding globulin</span> (SHBG) and albumin. </p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s10"></a><a name="section-3.1.3"></a><p></p>
<h3>C. Â  Â  Â Metabolism </h3>
<p class="First">Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions.  These transformations take place mainly in the liver.  Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both can be converted to estriol, which is the major urinary metabolite.  Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver, biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine, and hydrolysis in the intestine followed by reabsorption.  In postmenopausal women, a significant proportion of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens. </p>
<p>Estradiol from Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span> avoids first pass metabolism and provides estradiol/estrone ratios at steady state in the range of 0.42 to 0.65. </p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s11"></a><a name="section-3.1.4"></a><p></p>
<h3>D. Â  Â  Â Excretion </h3>
<p class="First">Estradiol, estrone, and estriol are excreted in the urine along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates.  The apparent terminal half-life for estradiol was about 10 hours following administration of Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span>. </p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s12"></a><a name="section-3.1.5"></a><p></p>
<h3>E. Â  Â  Â Special Populations </h3>
<p class="First">Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span> has been studied only in postmenopausal women.  No pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in special populations, including patients with renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>. </p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34073-7">
<a name="s13"></a><a name="section-3.1.6"></a><p></p>
<h3>F. Â  Â  Â Drug Interactions </h3>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> studies have shown that estrogens are metabolized partially by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Therefore, inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism. Inducers of CYP3A4, such as St. John's Wort preparations (Hypericum perforatum), phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and rifampin, may reduce plasma concentrations of estrogens, possibly resulting in a decrease in therapeutic effects and/or changes in the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="195876" conceptname="Hematometra">uterine bleeding</span> profile.  Inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, and grapefruit juice, may increase plasma concentrations of estrogens and result in side effects. </p>

<h3>G. Â  Â  Â Potential for Estradiol Transfer and Effects of Washing </h3>
<p class="First">As with most topical products, there is a potential for estradiol transfer following physical contact with Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span> application sites.  The effect of estradiol transfer was evaluated in healthy postmenopausal women who topically applied 1.0 g of Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (single dose) on one thigh.  One and 8 hours after gel application, they engaged in direct thigh- to- arm contact with a partner for 15 minutes.  While some elevation of estradiol levels over baseline was seen in the male subjects, the degree of transferability in this study was inconclusive. </p>
<p>The effect of application site washing on skin surface levels and serum concentrations of estradiol was determined in 16 healthy postmenopausal women after application of 1.0 g of Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span> to a 200 cm<span class="Sup">2</span> area on the thigh.  Washing the application site with soap and water 1 hour after application removed all detectable amounts of estradiol from the surface of the skin, and resulted in a 30-38% decrease in the mean total 24-hour exposure to estradiol. </p>

<h2>Women's Health Initiative Studies </h2>
<p class="First">The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) enrolled a total of 27,000 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women in two substudies to assess the risks and benefits of either the use of oral conjugated estrogens (CE 0.625 mg) alone per day or in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate (CE 0.625 mg/MPA 2.5 mg) per day compared to placebo in the prevention of certain chronic diseases.  The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) (nonfatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> (MI), silent MI and CHD <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome studied.  A "global index" included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440417" conceptname="Pulmonary embolism">pulmonary embolism</span> (PE), endometrial cancer (only in the estrogen-plus-progestin substudy), colorectal cancer, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4138412" conceptname="Fracture of proximal end of femur">hip fracture</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> due to other cause.  The study did not evaluate the effects of CE or CE/MPA on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439082" conceptname="Menopausal syndrome">menopausal symptoms</span>. </p>
<p>The estrogen-alone substudy was stopped early because an increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> was observed and it was deemed that no further information would be obtained regarding the risks and benefits of estrogen alone in predetermined primary endpoints.  Results of the estrogen-alone substudy, which included 10,739 women (average age of 63 years, range 50 to 79; 75.3% White, 15.1% Black, 6.1% Hispanic, 3.6% Other), after an average follow-up of 6.8 years are presented in <a href="#t3">Table 3</a>. </p>

<h3>b. Â  Â  Â Coronary heart disease </h3>
<p class="First">In the estrogen-alone substudy of WHI, no overall effect on coronary heart disease (CHD) events (defined as non-fatal MI, silent MI, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>, due to CHD) was reported in women receiving estrogen-alone compared to placebo. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#s15">CLINICAL STUDIES</a></span>.) </p>
<p>In the estrogen-plus-progestin substudy of WHI, no statistically significant increase of CHD events was reported in women receiving CE/MPA compared to women receiving placebo (39 vs. 33 per 10,000 women-years).  An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year one and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5. </p>
<p>In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n=2,763, average age 66.7 years), a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study (HERS)) treatment with CE/MPA (0.625 mg/2.5 mg per day) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit.  During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE/MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease.  There were more CHD events in the CE/MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years.  Participation in an open label extension of the original HERS trial (HERS II) was agreed to by 2,321 women.  Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall.  Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE/MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. </p>
<p>Large doses of estrogen (5 mg conjugated estrogens per day), comparable to those used to treat cancer of the prostate and breast, have been shown in a large prospective clinical trial in men to increase the risks of non-fatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440417" conceptname="Pulmonary embolism">pulmonary embolism</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320741" conceptname="Thrombophlebitis">thrombophlebitis</span>. </p>

The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first two years.  (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#s15">CLINICAL STUDIES</a></span>.) </p>
<p>In the estrogen-plus-progestin substudy of WHI, a statistically significant two-fold greater rate of VTE, was reported in women receiving CE/MPA compared to women receiving placebo (35 vs. 17 per 10,000 women-years).  Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 vs. 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 vs. 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated.  The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#s15">CLINICAL STUDIES</a></span>.) </p>
<p>If feasible, estrogens should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4159647" conceptname="Thromboembolic disorder">thromboembolism</span>, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. </p>

<h3>a. Â  Â  Â Endometrial cancer </h3>
<p class="First">The use of unopposed estrogens in women with intact uteri has been associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer.  The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose.  Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than 1 year.  The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risk of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more.  This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. </p>
<p>Clinical surveillance of all women taking estrogen/progestin combinations is important.  Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129155" conceptname="Vaginal bleeding">vaginal bleeding</span>.  There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose.  Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200775" conceptname="Endometrial hyperplasia">endometrial hyperplasia</span>, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. </p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">

<h3>b. Â  Â  Â Breast Cancer </h3>
<p class="First">In some studies, the use of estrogens and progestins by postmenopausal women has been reported to increase the risk of breast cancer.  The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about this issue is the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s15">CLINICAL STUDIES</a></span>).  The results from observational studies are generally consistent with those of the WHI clinical trial. </p>
<p>Observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen-plus-progestin combination therapy, and a smaller increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. For both findings, the excess risk increased with duration of use, and appeared to return to baseline over about five years after stopping treatment (only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping). In these studies, the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen-plus-progestin combination therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogens or among different estrogen-plus-progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration. </p>
<p>In the estrogen-alone substudy of WHI, after an average of 7.1 years of follow-up, CE (0.625 mg daily) was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer (RR 0.80, 95 % nCI 0.62-1.04). </p>
<p>In the estrogen-plus-progestin substudy, after a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the WHI substudy reported an increased risk of breast cancer.  In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen/progestin combination hormone therapy was reported by 26% of the women.  The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24 (95% nCI, 1.01-1.54), and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for estrogen-plus-progestin compared with placebo, respectively.  Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for estrogen-plus-progestin compared with placebo.  Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years for estrogen-plus-progestin compared with placebo.  In the WHI trial, invasive breast cancers were larger and diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the estrogen-plus-progestin group compared with the placebo group.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4116496" conceptname="Disseminated adenocarcinoma">Metastatic disease</span> was rare with no apparent difference between the two groups.  Other prognostic factors such as histologic subtype, grade and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups. </p>
<p>The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen-plus-progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. </p>
<p>All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations.  In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. </p>

<h3>1. Â  Â  Â Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy </h3>
<p class="First">Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200775" conceptname="Endometrial hyperplasia">endometrial hyperplasia</span> than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200775" conceptname="Endometrial hyperplasia">Endometrial hyperplasia</span> may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. </p>
<p>There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens.  These include a possible increased risk of breast cancer, adverse effects on lipoprotein metabolism (e.g., lowering HDL, raising LDL), and impairment of glucose tolerance. </p>

<p class="First">In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens.  In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogens on blood pressure was not seen.  Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen use. </p>

<h3>14. Â  Â  Â Potential for Estradiol Transfer and Effects of Washing </h3>
<p class="First">There is a potential for drug transfer from one individual to the other following physical contact of Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span> application sites.  In a study to evaluate transferability to males from their female contacts, there was some elevation of estradiol levels over baseline in the male subjects, however, the degree of transferability in this study was inconclusive.  Patients are advised to avoid skin contact with other subjects until the gel is completely dried. The site of application should be covered (clothed) after drying. </p>
<p>Washing the application site with soap and water 1 hour after application resulted in a 30 to 38% decrease in the mean total 24-hour exposure to estradiol.  Therefore, patients should refrain from washing the application site for at least one hour after application. </p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION </h1>
<p class="First">When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer.  A woman without a uterus does not need progestin.  Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.  Patients should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (e.g., 3-month to 6-month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s2">BOXED WARNINGS</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#s21">WARNINGS</a></span>).  For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129155" conceptname="Vaginal bleeding">vaginal bleeding</span>. </p>
<p>Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (estradiol gel) 0.1%, at doses of 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 g/day, is indicated for topical use in the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span>.  Each gram of Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span> contains 1 mg of estradiol. </p>
<p>Patients should be treated with the lowest effective dose of Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span>.  Generally, women should be started at 0.25 gram Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span> daily. Subsequent dosage adjustments may be made based upon the individual patient response. This dose should be periodically reassessed by the healthcare provider. </p>
<p>Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span> should be applied once daily on the skin of either the right or left upper thigh.  The application surface area should be about 5 by 7 inches (approximately the size of two palm prints).  The entire contents of a unit dose packet should be applied each day.  To avoid potential <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280604" conceptname="Skin irritation">skin irritation</span>, Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span> should be applied to the right or left upper thigh on alternating days.  Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span> should not be applied on the face, breasts, or irritated skin or in or around the vagina.  After application, the gel should be allowed to dry before dressing.  The application site should not be washed within 1 hour after applying Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span>.  Contact of the gel with eyes should be avoided.  Hands should be washed after application. </p>

<p>Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span> is a medicine that contains an estrogen hormone (estradiol).  Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span> is a clear, colorless, smooth gel that is odorless when dry.   </p>

<p>Estrogens are hormones made by a woman's ovaries.  The ovaries normally stop making estrogens when a woman is between 45 to 55 years old.  This drop in body estrogen levels causes the â€œchange of lifeâ€? or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span> (the end of monthly menstrual periods).  Sometimes, both ovaries are removed during an operation before natural <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span> takes place.  The sudden drop in estrogen levels causes â€œsurgical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span>.â€? </p>
<p>When the estrogen levels begin dropping, some women develop very uncomfortable symptoms, such as feelings of warmth in the face, neck, and chest, or sudden strong feelings of heat and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span> (â€œhot flashesâ€? or â€œhot flushesâ€?).  In some women, the symptoms are mild, and they will not need estrogens.  In other women, symptoms can be more severe.  You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span>. </p>

<p><span class="Bold">How should I use Divigel</span><span class="Sup">Â®</span>? </p>
<ol class="Arabic">
<li>Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span> should be used once daily. </li>
<li>Start at the lowest dose and talk to your healthcare provider about how well that dose is working for you. </li>
<li>Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span> should be used at the lowest dose possible for your treatment and only as long as needed. </li>
</ol>
<p>You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly (for example, every 3 to 6 months) about the dose you are taking and whether you still need treatment with Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span>. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Important things to remember when using Divigel</span><span class="Sup">Â®</span></p>
<ul class="Disc">
<li><span class="Bold">Wash your hands with soap and water after applying the gel to reduce the chance that the medicine will be spread from your hands to other people.</span></li>
<li>Allow the gel to dry before dressing.  Try to keep the area dry for as long as possible. </li>
<li>Do not allow others to come in contact with the area of skin where you applied the gel for at least one hour after you apply Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span>. </li>
<li>You should not allow others to apply the gel for you.  However, if this is necessary, the individual should wear a disposable plastic glove to avoid direct contact with Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span>

If it is more than 12 hours until the next dose, apply the dose you missed and resume your normal dosing the next day.  Do not apply Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span> more than once each day.  If you accidentally spill some of the contents of a Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span> packet, do not open a new packet.  Wait and apply your normal dose the next day. </p>

<p>Once you have applied Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span>, it has dried, and you have washed your hands, there is little risk of transfer to another person.  If someone else is exposed to Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span> by direct contact with the wet gel, that person should wash the area of contact with soap and water as soon as possible.  This is especially important for men and children.  The longer the gel is in contact with the skin before washing, the chance is greater that the other person will absorb some of the estrogen hormone. </p>

<p>Talk with your healthcare provider regularly about whether you should continue taking Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span>.  If you have a uterus, talk to your healthcare provider about whether the addition of a progestin is right for you.  In general, the addition of a progestin is recommended for women with a uterus to reduce the chance of getting cancer of the uterus.   See your healthcare provider right away if you get <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129155" conceptname="Vaginal bleeding">vaginal bleeding</span> while taking Divigel<span class="Sup">Â®</span>.  Have a breast exam and mammogram (breast X-ray) every year unless your healthcare provider tells you otherwise.  If members of your family have had breast cancer or if you have ever had <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80767" conceptname="Breast lump">breast lumps</span> or an abnormal mammogram, you may need to have breast exams more often.
