<h2>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium</h2>
<p class="First">Diclofenac sodium is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). In pharmacologic studies, diclofenac sodium has shown anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of diclofenac sodium, like other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but may be related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition.</p>
<p>Diclofenac sodium is completely absorbed from the GI tract after fasting, oral administration. The diclofenac sodium in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum. Only 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available due to first pass metabolism. Peak plasma levels are achieved in 2 hours (range 1 to 4 hours), and the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2.0 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively.</p>
<p>Five diclofenac metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine. The metabolites include 4’-hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3’-hydroxy-, 4’,5-dihydroxy- and 3’-hydroxy-4’-methoxy diclofenac. The major diclofenac metabolite, 4’-hydroxy-diclofenac, has very weak pharmacologic activity. The formation of 4’-hydroxy-diclofenac is primarily mediated by CYP2C9. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3’-hydroxy-diclofenac.</p>
<p>Plasma concentrations of diclofenac sodium decline from peak levels in a biexponential fashion, with the terminal phase having a half-life of approximately 2 hours. Clearance and volume of distribution are about 350 mL/min and 550 mL/kg, respectively. More than 99% of diclofenac sodium is reversibly bound to human plasma albumin.</p>
<p>Diclofenac sodium is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the bile.</p>
<p>Conjugates of unchanged diclofenac account for 5 to 10% of the dose excreted in the urine and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated drug is excreted. Conjugates of the principal metabolite account for 20 to 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10 to 20% of the dose excreted in the bile.</p>
<p>Conjugates of three other metabolites together account for 10 to 20% of the dose excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. The elimination half-life values for these metabolites are shorter than those for the parent drug. Urinary excretion of an additional metabolite (half-life = 80 hours) accounts for only 1.4% of the oral dose. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity.</p>

<h2>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of misoprostol</h2>
<p class="First">Misoprostol is a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog with gastric antisecretory and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. A deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric and duodenal mucosa may lead to diminishing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span> and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs.</p>
<p>Misoprostol can increase <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span> and mucus production, but in humans this has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4057053" conceptname="Acute duodenal ulcer">duodenal ulcers</span> is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies on canine parietal cells using titrated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereo-specific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained.</p>
<p>Misoprostol produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor intrinsic factor output.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Effects on gastric acid secretion: </span>Misoprostol, over the range of 50 to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter-lived, and only the 200 mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine- and meal-stimulated secretion.</p>
<p>Orally administered misoprostol is rapidly and extensively absorbed, and it undergoes rapid metabolism to its biologically active metabolite, misoprostol acid. Misoprostol acid in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets reaches a maximum plasma concentration in about 20 minutes and is, thereafter, quickly eliminated with an elimination t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> of about 30 minutes. There is high variability in plasma levels of misoprostol acid between and within studies, but mean values after single doses show a linear relationship with dose of misoprostol over the range of 200 to 400 mcg. No accumulation of misoprostol acid was found in multiple-dose studies, and plasma steady state was achieved within 2 days. The serum protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range.</p>
<p>After oral administration of radio-labeled misoprostol, about 70% of detected radioactivity appears in the urine. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food, and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid; this effect does not appear to be clinically important.</p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine or propranolol given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart.</p>

<p>The rate and extent of absorption of both diclofenac sodium and misoprostol acid from diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/0.2 mg and 75 mg/0.2 mg are similar to those from diclofenac sodium and misoprostol formulations each administered alone.</p>
<p>Neither diclofenac sodium nor misoprostol acid accumulated in plasma following repeated doses of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given every 12 hours under fasted conditions. Food decreases the multiple-dose bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/0.2 mg and 75 mg/0.2 mg.</p>

<h3><span class="Italics">Specific populations</span></h3>
<p class="First">A 4-week study, comparing plasma level profiles of diclofenac (50 mg bid) in younger (26 to 46 years) versus older (66 to 81 years) adults, did not show differences between age groups (10 patients per age group). In a multiple-dose (bid) crossover study of 24 people aged 65 years or older, the misoprostol contained in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium.</p>
<p>Differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac have not been detected in studies of patients with renal (50 mg intravenously) or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> (100 mg oral solution). In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42 mL/min), AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy people. In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4026125" conceptname="Chronic active hepatitis">chronic active hepatitis</span> (variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubins, N=10), diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values were comparable to those in healthy people.</p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic studies with misoprostol in patients with varying degrees of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> showed an approximate doubling of t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>, C<span class="Sub">max</span>, and AUC compared to healthy people. In people over 64 years of age, the AUC for misoprostol acid is increased.</p>
<p>In a study of people with mild to moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>, mean misoprostol acid AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> showed approximately double the mean values obtained in healthy people. Three people who had the lowest antipyrine and lowest indocyanine green clearance values had the highest misoprostol acid AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> values.</p>
<p>After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 77%) after single 200 mcg and 600 mcg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to &lt; 1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose.</p>

<h2>Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</p>
<p>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI events (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_908e3912-ca4b-4490-949a-c91e6644657f">WARNINGS</a>, <a href="#LINK_6f16d119-2866-4d01-8dbf-c4a900a57d51">Gastrointestinal Effects - Risk of Ulceration, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">Bleeding</span>, and Perforation</a></span>).</p>

<h2>Gastrointestinal Effects - Risk of Ulceration, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">Bleeding</span>, and Perforation</h2>
<p class="First">NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcers</span>, gross <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2 to 4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcer</span> disease or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">gastrointestinal bleeding</span>. Patients with a <span class="Italics">prior history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4027663" conceptname="Peptic ulcer">peptic ulcer disease</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">gastrointestinal bleeding</span></span> who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">GI bleed</span> compared to patients treated with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients, and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.</p>
<p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulcerations and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.</p>
<p>Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with active GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>.</p>

<h2>Renal Effects</h2>
<p class="First">Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4152839" conceptname="Acute papillary necrosis">renal papillary necrosis</span> and other <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4220631" conceptname="Injury of kidney">renal injury</span>. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE-inhibitors, and the elderly.

<h2>Advanced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">Renal Disease</span></h2>
<p class="First">Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets contain diclofenac. Diclofenac metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys. The extent to which the metabolites may accumulate in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> has not been studied. Therefore, treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is not recommended in patients with advanced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patient’s renal function is advisable.</p>

<h2>Hepatic Effects</h2>
<p class="First">In clinical trials with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, meaningful elevation of ALT (SGPT, more than 3 times the ULN [ULN = the upper limit of the normal range]) occurred in 1.6% of 2,184 patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and in 1.4% of 1,691 patients treated with diclofenac sodium. These increases were generally transient, and enzyme levels returned to within the normal range upon discontinuation of therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. The misoprostol component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets does not appear to exacerbate the hepatic effects caused by the diclofenac sodium component.</p>
<p>Elevations of one or more liver tests may occur during therapy with diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with continued therapy. Borderline elevations (i.e., less than 3 times the ULN), or greater elevations of transaminases occurred in about 15% of diclofenac-treated patients. Of the markers of hepatic function, ALT (SGPT) is recommended for the monitoring of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver injury</span>.</p>
<p>In clinical trials, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of AST (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4094657" conceptname="Aspartate aminotransferase">SGOT</span>) (ALT was not measured in all studies) occurred in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment. In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated for 2 to 6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of patients and included marked elevations (i.e., more than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3 to 8 times the ULN), and marked (&gt;8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80180" conceptname="Osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</span> than in those with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span>. In another clinical trial where over 17,000 patients received diclofenac for a mean of 18 months, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> was rarely observed.</p>
<p>Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations.</p>
<p>In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and usually occur within 1 to 6 months, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4337543" conceptname="Hepatic necrosis">liver necrosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span>, fulminant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> with and without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">liver failure</span>. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation.</p>
<p>Physicians should measure transaminases periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac.</p>
<p>If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302954" conceptname="Disorder characterized by eosinophilia">eosinophilia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, dark urine, etc.), diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be discontinued immediately.</p>
<p>To minimize the possibility that hepatic injury will become severe between transaminase measurements, physicians should inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4061577" conceptname="Lethargy">lethargy</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span>, right upper quadrant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4082445" conceptname="Tenderness">tenderness</span>, and “flu-like? symptoms), and the appropriate action patients should take if these signs and symptoms appear.</p>
<p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Caution should be exercised in prescribing diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., antibiotics, anti-epileptics).</p>

<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">Because serious GI tract ulcerations and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs should have their CBC and a chemistry profile checked periodically. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span> develop, systemic manifestations occur (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302954" conceptname="Disorder characterized by eosinophilia">eosinophilia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>, etc.), or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be discontinued.</p>

The mean changes were observed to be less than 1 second in both instances, however, and are unlikely to be clinically important. Diclofenac sodium is a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor, however, and all drugs that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis interfere with platelet function to some degree; therefore, patients who may be adversely affected by such an action should be carefully observed. Misoprostol has not been shown to exacerbate the effects of diclofenac on platelet activity.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">ACE-Inhibitors:</span></span></p>
<p>Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors.</p>
<p>In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span>. These effects are usually reversible.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Aspirin</span>:</span></p>
<p>When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are administered with aspirin, the protein binding of diclofenac is reduced, although the clearance of the free diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of diclofenac sodium and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential risk of increased adverse effects.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Digoxin</span>:</span></p>
<p>Elevated digoxin levels have been reported in patients receiving digoxin and diclofenac sodium.</p>
<p>Patients receiving digoxin and diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be monitored for possible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">digoxin toxicity</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Warfarin</span>:</span></p>
<p>The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> greater than users of either drug alone.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Oral hypoglycemics</span>:</span></p>
<p>Diclofenac sodium does not alter glucose metabolism in healthy people nor does it alter the effects of oral hypoglycemic agents. There are rare reports, however, from marketing experience, of changes in effects of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents in the presence of diclofenac sodium that necessitated change in the doses of such agents. Both hypo- and hyperglycemic effects have been reported. A direct causal relationship has not been established, but physicians should consider the possibility that diclofenac sodium may alter a diabetic patient’s response to insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Methotrexate</span>:</span></p>
<p>NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Tacrolimus:</span></span></p>
<p>Possible increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126119" conceptname="Toxic nephropathy">nephrotoxicity</span> when NSAIDs are given with tacrolimus.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Cyclosporine</span>:</span></p>
<p>Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, like other NSAID containing products, may affect renal prostaglandins and increase the toxicity of certain drugs. Ingestion of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may increase cyclosporine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126119" conceptname="Toxic nephropathy">nephrotoxicity</span>. Patients who begin taking diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or who increase their dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets while taking cyclosporine may develop toxicity characteristic for cyclosporine. They should be observed closely, particularly if renal function is impaired.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Lithium</span>:</span></p>
<p>NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium toxicity</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Antacids</span>:</span></p>
<p>Antacids reduce the bioavailability of misoprostol acid. Antacids may also delay absorption of diclofenac sodium. Magnesium-containing antacids exacerbate misoprostol-associated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>. Thus, it is not recommended that diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets be coadministered with magnesium-containing antacids.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Diuretics</span>:</span></p>
<p>Clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations, have shown that diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_908e3912-ca4b-4490-949a-c91e6644657f">WARNINGS</a>, <a href="#LINK_4fc082ac-5a44-403d-bd4e-1431bb44a5ed">Renal Effects</a></span>), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy. Concomitant therapy with potassium-sparing diuretics may be associated with increased serum potassium levels.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">CYP2C9 inhibitors</span></span></p>
<p>Use caution when dosing diclofenac with CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g. voriconazole). Concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors may enhance toxicity of diclofenac due to an increase in systemic exposure to diclofenac. When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the total daily dose of diclofenac should not exceed the lowest recommended dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/0.2 mg twice daily (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_c774cecf-3e3d-4aa1-8de6-b8871e994e58">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Voriconazole:</span></span></p>
<p>In a published study, single dose diclofenac (50 mg) was coadministered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2). The mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of diclofenac were increased by 2.1-fold and 1.8-fold respectively when coadministered with voriconazole compared to diclofenac alone.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">CYP2C9 inducers</span></span></p>
<p>Use caution when dosing diclofenac with CYP2C9 inducers (e.g. rifampin). Concomitant use of CYP2C9 inducers may lead to compromised efficacy due to a decrease in systemic exposure to diclofenac. The separate products of misoprostol and diclofenac should be used if a higher dose of diclofenac is deemed necessary (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_c774cecf-3e3d-4aa1-8de6-b8871e994e58">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>). </p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Other drugs</span>:</span></p>
<p>In small groups of patients (7 to 10 patients/interaction study), the concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine, prednisolone, doxycycline, or digitoxin did not significantly affect the peak levels and AUC levels of diclofenac sodium. Phenobarbital toxicity has been reported to have occurred in a patient on chronic phenobarbital treatment following the initiation of diclofenac therapy. <span class="Italics">In vitro, </span>diclofenac interferes minimally with the protein binding of prednisolone (10% decrease in binding).

<h2>Animal toxicology</h2>
<p class="First">A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse during long-term toxicology studies with misoprostol. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year.

<h2>Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Long-term animal studies to evaluate the potential for carcinogenesis and animal studies to evaluate the effects on fertility have been performed with each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given alone. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets itself (diclofenac sodium and misoprostol combinations in 250:1 ratio) was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the rat lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, or the mouse micronucleus test.</p>
<p>In a 24-month rat carcinogenicity study, oral misoprostol at doses up to 2.4 mg/kg/day (14.4 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, 24 times the recommended maximum human dose of 0.6 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day) was not tumorigenic. In a 21-month mouse carcinogenicity study, oral misoprostol at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day (48 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day), 80 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area, was not tumorigenic. Misoprostol, when administered to male and female breeding rats in an oral dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day (0.6 to 60 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, 1 to 100 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area) produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose. These findings suggest the possibility of a general adverse effect on fertility in males and females.</p>
<p>In a 24-month rat carcinogenicity study, oral diclofenac sodium up to 2 mg/kg/day (12 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day) was not tumorigenic. For a 50-kg person of average height (1.46m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area), this dose represents 0.08 times the recommended maximum human dose (148 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) on a body surface area basis. In a 24-month mouse carcinogenicity study, oral diclofenac sodium at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg/day (0.9 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, 0.006 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area) in males and 1 mg/kg/day (3 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, 0.02 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area) in females was not tumorigenic. Diclofenac sodium at oral doses up to 4 mg/kg/day (24 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, 0.16 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats.</p>

<h2>Geriatric use</h2>
<p class="First">As with any NSAIDs, caution should be exercised in treating the elderly (65 years and older).</p>
<p>Of the more than 2,100 subjects in clinical studies with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 25% were 65 and over, while 6% were 75 and over. In studies with diclofenac, 31% of subjects were 65 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>Diclofenac is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may be greater in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>.

<p class="First">Clinical signs that may suggest diclofenac sodium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> include GI complaints, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, or general <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">hypotonia</span>. Reports of overdosage with diclofenac cover 66 cases. In approximately one-half of these reports of overdosage, concomitant medications were also taken.

A 24-year-old woman who took 4.0 g and the 28- and 42-year-old women, each of whom took 3.75 g, did not develop any clinically significant signs or symptoms.

<h1> DICLOFENAC SODIUM/MISOPROSTAL TABLETS</h1>
<p class="First">Symptoms of overdosage with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be treated with supportive therapy. In case of acute overdosage, gastric lavage is recommended. Induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span> may be beneficial because diclofenac sodium and misoprostol metabolites are excreted in the urine. The effect of dialysis or hemoperfusion on the elimination of diclofenac sodium (99% protein bound) and misoprostol acid remains unproven. The use of oral activated charcoal may help to reduce the absorption of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_908e3912-ca4b-4490-949a-c91e6644657f">WARNINGS</a></span>).</p>
<p>After observing the response to initial therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient’s needs.</p>

<p>Dosages may be individualized using the separate products (misoprostol and diclofenac), after which the patient may be changed to the appropriate dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. If clinically indicated, misoprostol co-therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, or use of the individual components to optimize the misoprostol dose and/or frequency of administration, may be appropriate. The total dose of misoprostol should not exceed 800 mcg/day, and no more than 200 mcg of misoprostol should be administered at any one time.

<p>If signs of an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylactic reaction</span> occur (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">difficulty breathing</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span> of the face or throat), you should stop therapy and seek immediate medical attention (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_908e3912-ca4b-4490-949a-c91e6644657f">WARNINGS</a></span>).</p>
<p>Do not take diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets if you are pregnant (see boxed <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_4f492f78-0ca3-4651-b242-bf5fb7822f86">CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS</a></span>). Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets contain diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Misoprostol can cause abortion (sometimes incomplete which could lead to dangerous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> and require hospitalization and surgery), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439128" conceptname="Extreme immaturity">premature birth</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span>. It is also important to avoid pregnancy while taking this medication and for at least one month or through one menstrual cycle after you stop taking it. Misoprostol has been reported to cause the uterus to rupture (tear) when given after the eighth week of pregnancy. Rupture (tearing) of the uterus can result in severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, hysterectomy, and/or maternal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079844" conceptname="Fetal death">fetal death</span>.</p>
<p>If you become pregnant during therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, stop taking diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and contact your doctor immediately. Remember that even if you are using a means of birth control, it is still possible to become pregnant. Should this occur, stop taking diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and consult your doctor immediately.</p>
<p>Exercise caution if you are nursing.</p>
<p>Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, like other NSAIDs, may cause an increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, which can lead to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. This risk may increase with duration of use. If you have heart disease or risk factors for heart disease, you may be at greater risk (see boxed <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_4f492f78-0ca3-4651-b242-bf5fb7822f86">CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS</a></span>). Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should never be used for treatment of peri-operative <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery (see boxed <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_4f492f78-0ca3-4651-b242-bf5fb7822f86">CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS</a></span>).</p>

<p>Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, like other NSAIDs, may cause GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090431" conceptname="Discomfort">discomfort</span> and, rarely, serious GI effects such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcers</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, which may result in hospitalization and even <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.</p>
<p>Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012224" conceptname="Upset stomach">upset stomach</span>, and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> in some people. In most cases these problems develop during the first few weeks of therapy and stop after about a week with continued treatment. You can minimize possible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span> by making sure you take diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with meals and by avoiding the use of antacids containing magnesium (if needed, use one containing aluminum or calcium instead). Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed, crushed, or dissolved. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets that are broken should not be taken.</p>
<p>Because these side effects are usually mild to moderate and usually go away in a matter of days, most patients can continue to take diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. If you have prolonged difficulty (more than 7 days), or if you have severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, cramping, and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, call your doctor.</p>
<p>Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may also cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can lead to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. These events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms. Elderly patients are at greater risk for serious gastrointestinal events (see boxed <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_4f492f78-0ca3-4651-b242-bf5fb7822f86">CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS</a></span>). This risk may increase with duration of use.</p>
<p>Although serious GI tract ulcerations and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> can occur without warning symptoms, ask for medical advice when observing signs and symptoms of ulceration and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194175" conceptname="Left upper quadrant pain">epigastric pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="23325" conceptname="Heartburn">dyspepsia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="193809" conceptname="Melena due to gastrointestinal hemorrhage">melena</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="26727" conceptname="Hematemesis">hematemesis</span>.
