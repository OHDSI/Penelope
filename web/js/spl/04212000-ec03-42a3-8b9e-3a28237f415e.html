<h1><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION</span></h1>
<p class="First">FORADIL<span class="Sup">®</span> AEROLIZER<span class="Sup">®</span> consists of a capsule dosage form containing a dry powder formulation of FORADIL (formoterol fumarate) intended for oral inhalation only with the AEROLIZER Inhaler.</p>
<p>
		     
	Each clear, hard gelatin capsule contains a dry powder blend of 12 mcg of formoterol fumarate and 25 mg of lactose (which contains trace levels of milk proteins) as a carrier.</p>
<p>
		     
	The active component of FORADIL is formoterol fumarate, a racemate. Formoterol fumarate is a selective beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic bronchodilator. Its chemical name is (±)-2-hydroxy-5-[(1RS)-1-hydroxy-2-[[(1RS)-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-methylethyl]-amino]ethyl]formanilide fumarate dihydrate; its structural formula is</p>
<p><img alt="formoterol fumarate structural formula" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=04212000-ec03-42a3-8b9e-3a28237f415e&amp;name=foradil-01.jpg"></p>
<p>
		     
	Formoterol fumarate has a molecular weight of 840.9, and its empirical formula is (C<span class="Sub">19</span>H<span class="Sub">24</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">4</span>)<span class="Sub">2</span>•C<span class="Sub">4</span>H<span class="Sub">4</span>O<span class="Sub">4</span>•<span class="Sub">2</span>H<span class="Sub">2</span>O. Formoterol fumarate is a white to yellowish crystalline powder, which is freely soluble in glacial acetic acid, soluble in methanol, sparingly soluble in ethanol and isopropanol, slightly soluble in water, and practically insoluble in acetone, ethyl acetate, and diethyl ether.</p>
<p>
		     
	The AEROLIZER Inhaler is a plastic device used for inhaling FORADIL. The amount of drug delivered to the lung will depend on patient factors, such as inspiratory flow rate and inspiratory time.  Under standardized in vitro testing at a fixed flow rate of 60 L/min for 2 seconds, the AEROLIZER Inhaler delivered 10 mcg of formoterol fumarate from the mouthpiece. Peak inspiratory flow rates (PIFR) achievable through the AEROLIZER Inhaler were evaluated in 33 adult and adolescent patients and 32 pediatric patients with mild-to-moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>. Mean PIFR was 117.82 L/min (range 34-188 L/min) for adult and adolescent patients, and 99.66 L/min (range 43-187 L/min) for pediatric patients. Approximately ninety percent of each population studied generated a PIFR through the device exceeding 60 L/min.</p>
<p>
		     
	To use the delivery system, a FORADIL capsule is placed in the well of the AEROLIZER Inhaler, and the capsule is pierced by pressing and releasing the buttons on the side of the device. The formoterol fumarate formulation is dispersed into the air stream when the patient inhales rapidly and deeply through the mouthpiece.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span></h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34090-1">
<a name="section-3.1"></a><p></p>
<h2><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></h2>
<p class="First">Formoterol fumarate is a long-acting selective beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic receptor agonist (beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonist).  Inhaled formoterol fumarate acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. In vitro studies have shown that formoterol has more than 200-fold greater agonist activity at beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-receptors than at beta<span class="Sub">1</span>-receptors.  Although beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-receptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and beta<span class="Sub">1</span>-receptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, there are also beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-receptors in the human heart comprising 10%-50% of the total beta-adrenergic receptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established, but they raise the possibility that even highly selective beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonists may have cardiac effects.</p>
<p>
		     
	The pharmacologic effects of beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including formoterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223759" conceptname="IgE-mediated allergic disorder">immediate hypersensitivity</span> from cells, especially from mast cells.</p>
<p>
		     
	In vitro tests show that formoterol is an inhibitor of the release of mast cell mediators, such as histamine and leukotrienes, from the human lung. Formoterol also inhibits histamine-induced plasma albumin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4295895" conceptname="Extravasation">extravasation</span> in anesthetized guinea pigs and inhibits allergen-induced eosinophil influx in dogs with airway hyper-responsiveness. The relevance of these in vitro and animal findings to humans is unknown.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Animal Pharmacology</span></h2>
<p class="First">Studies in laboratory animals (minipigs, rodents, and dogs) have demonstrated the occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmias</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4132309" conceptname="Sudden death">sudden death</span> (with histologic evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4354249" conceptname="Myocardial necrosis">myocardial necrosis</span>) when beta-agonists and methylxanthines are administered concurrently. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34090-1">
<a name="section-3.3"></a><p></p>
<h2><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span></h2>
<p class="First">Information on the pharmacokinetics of formoterol in plasma has been obtained in healthy subjects by oral inhalation of doses higher than the recommended range and in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255573" conceptname="Chronic obstructive lung disease">Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255573" conceptname="Chronic obstructive lung disease">COPD</span>) patients after oral inhalation of doses at and above the therapeutic dose. Urinary excretion of unchanged formoterol was used as an indirect measure of systemic exposure. Plasma drug disposition data parallel urinary excretion, and the elimination half-lives calculated for urine and plasma are similar.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34090-1">
<a name="section-3.3.1"></a><p></p>
<h3><span class="Bold Italics">Absorption</span></h3>
<p class="First">Following inhalation of a single 120 mcg dose of formoterol fumarate by 12 healthy subjects, formoterol was rapidly absorbed into plasma, reaching a maximum drug concentration of 92 pg/mL within 5 minutes of dosing. In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255573" conceptname="Chronic obstructive lung disease">COPD</span> patients treated for 12 weeks with formoterol fumarate 12 or 24 mcg b.i.d., the mean plasma concentrations of formoterol ranged between 4.0 and 8.8 pg/mL and 8.0 and 17.3 pg/mL, respectively, at 10 min, 2 h and 6 h post inhalation.</p>
<p>
		     
	Following inhalation of 12 to 96 mcg of formoterol fumarate by 10 healthy males, urinary excretion of both (R,R)- and (S,S)-enantiomers of formoterol increased proportionally to the dose. Thus, absorption of formoterol following inhalation appeared linear over the dose range studied.</p>
<p>
		     
	In a study in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>, when formoterol 12 or 24 mcg twice daily was given by oral inhalation for 4 weeks or 12 weeks, the accumulation index, based on the urinary excretion of unchanged formoterol ranged from 1.63 to 2.08 in comparison with the first dose. For <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255573" conceptname="Chronic obstructive lung disease">COPD</span> patients, when formoterol 12 or 24 mcg twice daily was given by oral inhalation for 12 weeks, the accumulation index, based on the urinary excretion of unchanged formoterol was 1.19 - 1.38. This suggests some accumulation of formoterol in plasma with multiple dosing. The excreted amounts of formoterol at steady-state were close to those predicted based on single-dose kinetics. As with many drug products for oral inhalation, it is likely that the majority of the inhaled formoterol fumarate delivered is swallowed and then absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34090-1">
<a name="section-3.3.2"></a><p></p>
<h3><span class="Bold Italics">Distribution</span></h3>
<p class="First">The binding of formoterol to human plasma proteins in vitro was 61%-64% at concentrations from 0.1 to 100 ng/mL. Binding to human serum albumin in vitro was 31%-38% over a range of 5 to 500 ng/mL. The concentrations of formoterol used to assess the plasma protein binding were higher than those achieved in plasma following inhalation of a single 120 mcg dose.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34090-1">
<a name="section-3.3.3"></a><p></p>
<h3><span class="Bold Italics">Metabolism</span></h3>
<p class="First">Formoterol is metabolized primarily by direct glucuronidation at either the phenolic or aliphatic hydroxyl group and O-demethylation followed by glucuronide conjugation at either phenolic hydroxyl groups. Minor pathways involve sulfate conjugation of formoterol and deformylation followed by sulfate conjugation. The most prominent pathway involves direct conjugation at the phenolic hydroxyl group.  The second major pathway involves O-demethylation followed by conjugation at the phenolic 2'-hydroxyl group. Four cytochrome P450 isozymes (CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP2A6) are involved in the O-demethylation of formoterol.  Formoterol did not inhibit CYP450 enzymes at therapeutically relevant concentrations. Some patients may be deficient in CYP2D6 or 2C19 or both.  Whether a deficiency in one or both of these isozymes results in elevated systemic exposure to formoterol or systemic adverse effects has not been adequately explored.</p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34090-1">
<a name="section-3.3.4"></a><p></p>
<h3><span class="Bold Italics">Excretion</span></h3>
<p class="First">Following oral administration of 80 mcg of radiolabeled formoterol fumarate to 2 healthy subjects, 59%-62% of the radioactivity was eliminated in the urine and 32%-34% in the feces over a period of 104 hours. Renal clearance of formoterol from blood in these subjects was about 150 mL/min.  Following inhalation of a 12 mcg or 24 mcg dose by 16 patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>, about 10% and 15%-18% of the total dose was excreted in the urine as unchanged formoterol and direct conjugates of formoterol, respectively. Following inhalation of 12 mcg or 24 mcg dose by 18 patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255573" conceptname="Chronic obstructive lung disease">COPD</span> the corresponding values were 7% and 6-9% of the dose, respectively.</p>
<p>
		     
	Based on plasma concentrations measured following inhalation of a single 120 mcg dose by 12 healthy subjects, the mean terminal elimination half-life was determined to be 10 hours. From urinary excretion rates measured in these subjects, the mean terminal elimination half-lives for the (R,R)- and (S,S)-enantiomers were determined to be 13.9 and 12.3 hours, respectively. The (R,R)- and (S,S)-enantiomers represented about 40% and 60% of unchanged drug excreted in the urine, respectively, following single inhaled doses between 12 and 120 mcg in healthy volunteers and single and repeated doses of 12 and 24 mcg in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>. Thus, the relative proportion of the two enantiomers remained constant over the dose range studied and there was no evidence of relative accumulation of one enantiomer over the other after repeated dosing.</p>

<p><span class="Italics">Geriatric and Pediatric: </span>The pharmacokinetics of formoterol have not been studied in the elderly population, and limited data are available in pediatric patients.</p>
<p>
		     
	In a study of children with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> who were 5 to 12 years of age, when formoterol fumarate 12 or 24 mcg was given twice daily by oral inhalation for 12 weeks, the accumulation index ranged from 1.18 to 1.84 based on urinary excretion of unchanged formoterol. Hence, the accumulation in children did not exceed that in adults, where the accumulation index ranged from 1.63 to 2.08 (see above).  Approximately 6% and 6.5% to 9% of the dose was recovered in the urine of the children as unchanged and conjugated formoterol, respectively.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold Italics">Systemic Safety and Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Relationships</span></h3>
<p class="First">The major adverse effects of inhaled beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonists occur as a result of excessive activation of the systemic beta-adrenergic receptors. The most common adverse effects in adults and adolescents include skeletal muscle <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75635" conceptname="Cramp">cramps</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, decreases in plasma potassium, and increases in plasma glucose.</p>
<p>
		     
	Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships between heart rate, ECG parameters, and serum potassium levels and the urinary excretion of formoterol were evaluated in 10 healthy male volunteers (25 to 45 years of age) following inhalation of single doses containing 12, 24, 48, or 96 mcg of formoterol fumarate. There was a linear relationship between urinary formoterol excretion and decreases in serum potassium, increases in plasma glucose, and increases in heart rate.</p>
<p>
		     
	In a second study, PK/PD relationships between plasma formoterol levels and pulse rate, ECG parameters, and plasma potassium levels were evaluated in 12 healthy volunteers following inhalation of a single 120 mcg dose of formoterol fumarate (10 times the recommended clinical dose).  Reductions of plasma potassium concentration were observed in all subjects. Maximum reductions from baseline ranged from 0.55 to 1.52 mmol/L with a median maximum reduction of 1.01 mmol/L. The formoterol plasma concentration was highly correlated with the reduction in plasma potassium concentration.  Generally, the maximum effect on plasma potassium was noted 1 to 3 hours after peak formoterol plasma concentrations were achieved. A mean maximum increase of pulse rate of 26 bpm was observed 6 hours post dose. The maximum increase of mean corrected QT interval (QTc) was 25 msec when calculated using Bazett's correction and was 8 msec when calculated using Fridericia's correction. The QTc returned to baseline within 12-24 hours post-dose. Formoterol plasma concentrations were weakly correlated with pulse rate and increase of QTc duration. The effects on plasma potassium, pulse rate, and QTc interval are known pharmacological effects of this class of study drug and were not unexpected at the very high formoterol dose (120 mcg single dose, 10 times the recommended single dose) tested in this study. These effects were well-tolerated by the healthy volunteers.  </p>

	The electrocardiographic and cardiovascular effects of FORADIL AEROLIZER were compared with those of albuterol and placebo in two pivotal 12-week double-blind studies of patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>.  A subset of patients underwent continuous electrocardiographic monitoring during three 24-hour periods. No important differences in ventricular or supraventricular ectopy between treatment groups were observed. In these two studies, the total number of patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> exposed to any dose of FORADIL AEROLIZER who had continuous electrocardiographic monitoring was about 200.</p>

An analysis of ECG intervals was performed for patients who participated at study sites in the United States, including 46 patients treated with FORADIL AEROLIZER 12 mcg twice daily, and 50 patients treated with FORADIL AEROLIZER 24 mcg twice daily. ECGs were performed predose, and at 5-15 minutes and 2 hours post-dose at study baseline and after 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment.

<p class="First">In multiple-dose clinical trials in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255573" conceptname="Chronic obstructive lung disease">COPD</span>, FORADIL AEROLIZER 12 mcg was shown to provide onset of significant bronchodilation (defined as 15% or greater increase from baseline in FEV<span class="Sub">1</span>) within 5 minutes of oral inhalation after the first dose. Bronchodilation was maintained for at least 12 hours.</p>
<p>
		     
	FORADIL AEROLIZER was studied in two pivotal, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multi-center, parallel-group trials in a total of 1634 adult patients (age range: 34-88 years; mean age: 63 years) with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255573" conceptname="Chronic obstructive lung disease">COPD</span> who had a mean FEV<span class="Sub">1</span> that was 46% of predicted. The diagnosis of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255573" conceptname="Chronic obstructive lung disease">COPD</span> was based upon a prior clinical diagnosis of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255573" conceptname="Chronic obstructive lung disease">COPD</span>, a smoking history (greater than 10 pack-years), age (at least 40 years), spirometry results (prebronchodilator baseline FEV<span class="Sub">1</span> less than 70% of the predicted value, and at least 0.75 liters, with the FEV<span class="Sub">1</span>/VC being less than 88% for men and less than 89% for women), and symptom score (greater than zero on at least four of the seven days prior to randomization).  These studies included approximately equal numbers of patients with and without baseline bronchodilator reversibility, defined as a 15% or greater increase FEV<span class="Sub">1</span> after inhalation of 200 mcg of albuterol sulfate. A total of 405 patients received FORADIL AEROLIZER 12 mcg, administered twice daily. Each trial compared FORADIL AEROLIZER 12 mcg twice daily and FORADIL AEROLIZER 24 mcg twice daily with placebo and an active control drug. The active control drug was ipratropium bromide in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255573" conceptname="Chronic obstructive lung disease">COPD</span> Trial A, and slow-release theophylline in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255573" conceptname="Chronic obstructive lung disease">COPD</span> Trial B (the theophylline arm in this study was open-label). The treatment period was 12 weeks in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255573" conceptname="Chronic obstructive lung disease">COPD</span> Trial A, and 12 months in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255573" conceptname="Chronic obstructive lung disease">COPD</span> Trial B.</p>
<p>
		     
	The results showed that FORADIL AEROLIZER 12 mcg twice daily resulted in significantly greater post-dose bronchodilation (as measured by serial FEV<span class="Sub">1</span> for 12 hours post-dose; the primary efficacy analysis) compared to placebo when evaluated after 12 weeks of treatment in both trials, and after 12 months of treatment in the 12-month trial (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255573" conceptname="Chronic obstructive lung disease">COPD</span> Trial B).

<ol class="Arabic">
<li>
<span class="Bold">Patients should be informed that long-acting beta</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sub">2</span></span><span class="Bold">-adrenergic agonists (LABA), including formoterol, the active ingredient in FORADIL AEROLIZER, increase the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>-related <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> and may increase the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>-related hospitalizations in pediatric and adolescent patients. Currently available data are inadequate to determine whether concurrent use of inhaled corticosteroids or other long-term <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> control drugs mitigates the increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>- related <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> from LABA. 
Patients should be informed that FORADIL AEROLIZER should not be the only therapy for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> and must only be used as additional therapy when a long-term <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> control medication (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids) do not adequately control <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> symptoms. Patients should be informed that when FORADIL AEROLIZER is added to their treatment regimen they must continue to use their long-term <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> control medication. 
</span><br>
</li>
<li>FORADIL AEROLIZER is not indicated to relieve acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> symptoms and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled, short-acting, beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonist (the health-care provider should prescribe the patient with such medication and instruct the patient in how it should be used). Patients should be instructed to seek medical attention if their symptoms worsen, if FORADIL AEROLIZER treatment becomes less effective, or if they need more inhalations of a short-acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonist than usual. Patients should not inhale more than the contents of one capsule at any one time. The daily dosage of FORADIL AEROLIZER should not exceed one capsule twice daily (24 mcg total daily dose).<br>
</li>
<li>FORADIL AEROLIZER should not be used as a substitute for oral or inhaled corticosteroids. The dosage of these medications should not be changed and they should not be stopped without consulting the physician, even if the patient feels better after initiating treatment with FORADIL AEROLIZER.<br>
</li>
<li>The active ingredient of FORADIL (formoterol fumarate) is a long-acting, bronchodilator used for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>, including nocturnal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>, and for the prevention of exercise-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256717" conceptname="Bronchospasm">bronchospasm</span>.  FORADIL AEROLIZER provides bronchodilation for up to 12 hours. Patients should be advised not to increase the dose or frequency of FORADIL AEROLIZER without consulting the prescribing physician. Patients should be warned not to stop or reduce concomitant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> therapy without medical advice.<br>
</li>
<li>When FORADIL AEROLIZER is used for the prevention of EIB, the contents of one capsule should be taken at least 15 minutes prior to exercise. Additional doses of FORADIL AEROLIZER should not be used for 12 hours. Prevention of EIB has not been studied in patients who are receiving chronic FORADIL AEROLIZER administration twice daily and these patients should not use additional FORADIL AEROLIZER for prevention of EIB.<br>
</li>
<li>Patients should be informed that treatment with beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonists may lead to adverse events which include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315078" conceptname="Palpitations">palpitations</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77670" conceptname="Chest pain">chest pain</span>, rapid heart rate, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436817" conceptname="Feeling nervous">nervousness</span>. <br>
</li>
<li>Patients should be informed never to use FORADIL AEROLIZER with a spacer and never to exhale into the device.<br>
</li>
<li>Patients should avoid exposing the FORADIL capsules to moisture and should handle the capsules with dry hands. The AEROLIZER Inhaler should never be washed and should be kept dry. The patient should always use the new AEROLIZER Inhaler that comes with each refill.<br>
</li>
<li>Women should be advised to contact their physician if they become pregnant or if they are nursing.<br>
</li>
<li>Patients should be told that in rare cases, the gelatin capsule might break into small pieces. These pieces should be retained by the screen built into the AEROLIZER Inhaler. However, it remains possible that rarely, tiny pieces of gelatin might reach the mouth or throat after inhalation. The capsule is less likely to shatter when pierced if: storage conditions are strictly followed, capsules are removed from the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443720" conceptname="Blister">blister</span> immediately before use, and the capsules are only pierced once.<br>
</li>
<li>It is important that patients understand how to use the AEROLIZER Inhaler appropriately and how it should be used in relation to other <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> medications they are taking (see the accompanying Medication Guide).</li>

<h2><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></h2>
<p class="First">If additional adrenergic drugs are to be administered by any route, they should be used with caution because the pharmacologically predictable sympathetic effects of formoterol may be potentiated.</p>
<p>
		     
	Concomitant treatment with xanthine derivatives, steroids, or diuretics may potentiate any hypokalemic effect of adrenergic agonists.</p>
<p>
		     
	The ECG changes and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span> that may result from the administration of non-potassium sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the co-administration of beta-agonist with non-potassium sparing diuretics.</p>
<p>
		     
	Formoterol, as with other beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonists, should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, or drugs known to prolong the QTc interval because the action of adrenergic agonists on the cardiovascular system may be potentiated by these agents. Drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval have an increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span>.</p>
<p>
		     
	Beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (beta-blockers) and formoterol may inhibit the effect of each other when administered concurrently. Beta-blockers not only block the therapeutic effects of beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonists, such as formoterol, but may produce severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256717" conceptname="Bronchospasm">bronchospasm</span> in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatic</span> patients. Therefore, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, e.g., as prophylaxis after <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-blockers in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>. In this setting, cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</span></h2>
<p class="First">The carcinogenic potential of formoterol fumarate has been evaluated in 2-year drinking water and dietary studies in both rats and mice. In rats, the incidence of ovarian leiomyomas was increased at doses of 15 mg/kg and above in the drinking water study and at 20 mg/kg in the dietary study, but not at dietary doses up to 5 mg/kg (AUC exposure approximately 450 times human exposure at the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose). In the dietary study, the incidence of benign ovarian theca-cell tumors was increased at doses of 0.5 mg/kg and above (AUC exposure at the low dose of 0.5 mg/kg was approximately 45 times human exposure at the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose).

The incidence of hepatocarcinomas was increased in the dietary study at doses of 20 and 50 mg/kg in females and 50 mg/kg in males, but not at doses up to 5 mg/kg in either males or females (AUC exposure approximately 60 times human exposure at the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose). Also in the dietary study, the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197236" conceptname="Uterine leiomyoma">uterine leiomyomas</span> and leiomyosarcomas was increased at doses of 2 mg/kg and above (AUC exposure at the low dose of 2 mg/kg was approximately 25 times human exposure at the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose). Increases in leiomyomas of the rodent female genital tract have been similarly demonstrated with other beta-agonist drugs.</p>
<p>
		     
	Formoterol fumarate was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests: mutagenicity tests in bacterial and mammalian cells, chromosomal analyses in mammalian cells, unscheduled DNA synthesis repair tests in rat hepatocytes and human fibroblasts, transformation assay in mammalian fibroblasts and micronucleus tests in mice and rats.</p>

When given to rats throughout organogenesis, oral doses of 0.2 mg/kg and above delayed ossification of the fetus, and doses of 6 mg/kg and above decreased fetal weight. Formoterol fumarate did not cause malformations in rats or rabbits following oral administration. Because there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, FORADIL AEROLIZER should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

There are no adequate and well-controlled human studies that have investigated the effects of FORADIL AEROLIZER during labor and delivery.</p>

	Because beta-agonists may potentially interfere with uterine contractility, FORADIL AEROLIZER should be used during labor only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk.</p>

There is insufficient evidence to determine if dialysis is beneficial for overdosage of FORADIL AEROLIZER. Cardiac monitoring is recommended in cases of overdosage.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold">Pediatric and Adolescent Patients</span></h3>
<p class="First">Available data from controlled clinical trials suggest that LABA increase the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients. For patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> less than 18 years of age who require addition of a LABA to an inhaled corticosteroid, a fixed-dose combination product containing both an inhaled corticosteroid and LABA should ordinarily be used to ensure adherence with both drugs. In cases where use of a separate long-term <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> control medication (e.g. inhaled corticosteroid) and LABA is clinically indicated, appropriate steps must be taken to ensure adherence with both treatment components. If adherence cannot be assured, a fixed-dose combination product containing both an inhaled corticosteroid and LABA is recommended.</p>
<p>
		     
	For adults and children 5 years of age and older, the usual dosage is the inhalation of the contents of one 12-mcg FORADIL capsule every 12 hours using the AEROLIZER Inhaler. The patient must not exhale into the device. The total daily dose of FORADIL should not exceed one capsule twice daily (24 mcg total daily dose). More frequent administration or administration of a larger number of inhalations is not recommended. If symptoms arise between doses, an inhaled short-acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonist should be taken for immediate relief.</p>
<p>
		     
	If a previously effective dosage regimen fails to provide the usual response, medical advice should be sought immediately as this is often a sign of destabilization of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>.

<p><span class="Bold">What is FORADIL AEROLIZER?</span></p>
<p>FORADIL AEROLIZER is a long-acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonist (LABA).  LABA medicines help the muscles around the airways in your lungs stay relaxed to prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> symptoms, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314754" conceptname="Wheezing">wheezing</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">shortness of breath</span>.  These symptoms can happen when the muscles around the airways tighten.  This makes it hard to breathe.  In severe cases, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314754" conceptname="Wheezing">wheezing</span> can stop your breathing and cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> if not treated right away.</p>

<p>9. Release the buttons. If the buttons stay stuck, grasp the wings on the buttons and pull them out of the stuck position before the next step. Do not push the buttons a second time.  This may cause the FORADIL capsule to break into small pieces. There is a screen built into the AEROLIZER Inhaler to hold these small pieces. It is possible that tiny pieces of a FORADIL capsule might reach your mouth or throat when you inhale the medicine.  This will not harm you, but to avoid this, only pierce the capsule once.  The FORADIL capsules are also less likely to break into small pieces if you store them the right way (See “How do I store FORADIL AEROLIZER??).  </p>
