<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Propoxyphene Napsylate, USP is an odorless, white crystalline solid with a bitter taste. It is very slightly soluble in water and soluble in methanol, ethanol, chloroform, and acetone. Chemically, it is (Î±S, 1 <span class="Italics">R</span>)-Î±-[2-(Dimethylamino)-1-methylethyl]-Î±-phenylphenethyl propionate compound with 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid (1:1) monohydrate, which can be represented by the accompanying structural formula. Its molecular weight is 565.72 per USP.</p>

</div>
<p>Propoxyphene napsylate differs from propoxyphene hydrochloride in that it allows more stable liquid dosage forms and tablet formulations. Because of differences in molecular weight, a dose of 100 mg (176.8 Î¼mol) of propoxyphene napsylate is required to supply an amount of propoxyphene equivalent to that present in 65 mg (172.9 Î¼mol) of propoxyphene hydrochloride.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen, 4'-hydroxyacetanilide, a slightly bitter, white, odorless, crystalline powder, is a non-opiate, non-salicylate analgesic and antipyretic. It has the following structural formula.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Propoxyphene is a centrally acting narcotic analgesic agent. Equimolar doses of propoxyphene hydrochloride or napsylate provide similar plasma concentrations. Following administration of 65, 130, or 195 mg of propoxyphene hydrochloride, the bioavailability of propoxyphene is equivalent to that of 100, 200, or 300 mg respectively of propoxyphene napsylate. Peak plasma concentrations of propoxyphene are reached in 2 to 2 Â½ hours. After a 100 mg oral dose of propoxyphene napsylate, peak plasma levels of 0.05 to 0.1 mcg/mL are achieved. As shown in <span class="Bold"><a href="#f3">Figure 1</a></span>, the napsylate salt tends to be absorbed more slowly than the hydrochloride. At or near therapeutic doses, this absorption difference is small when compared with that among subjects and among doses.</p>
<div class="Figure">
<a name="f3"></a><img alt="Image from Drug Label Content" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=4cf33260-5a78-4207-b113-a9d6771811a3&amp;name=propoxyph-100-500-03.jpg"><p class="MultiMediaCaption">Figure 1: Mean plasma concentrations of propoxyphene in 8 human subjects following oral administration of 65 and 130 mg of the hydrochloride salt and 100 and 200 mg of the napsylate salt and in 7 given 195 mg of the hydrochloride and 300 mg of the napsylate salt.</p>
</div>
<p>Because of this several hundredfold difference in solubility, the absorption rate of very large doses of the napsylate salt is significantly lower than that of equimolar doses of the hydrochloride.</p>
<p>Repeated doses of propoxyphene at 6-hour intervals lead to increasing plasma concentrations, with a plateau reached after the ninth dose at 48 hours.</p>
<p>Propoxyphene is metabolized in the liver to yield norpropoxyphene. Propoxyphene has a half-life of 6 to 12 hours, whereas that of norpropoxyphene is 30 to 36 hours.</p>
<p>Norpropoxyphene has substantially less centralnervous-system-depressant effect than propoxyphene but a greater local anesthetic effect, which is similar to that of amitriptyline and antiarrhythmic agents, such as lidocaine and quinidine.</p>
<p>In animal studies in which propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene were continuously infused in large amounts, intracardiac conduction time (PR and QRS intervals) was prolonged. Any intracardiac conduction delay attributable to high concentrations of norpropoxyphene may be of relatively long duration.</p>

<h2>Actions</h2>
<p class="First">Propoxyphene is a mild narcotic analgesic structurally related to methadone. The potency of propoxyphene napsylate is from two thirds to equal that of codeine.</p>
<p>Propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen tablets provide the analgesic activity of propoxyphene napsylate and the antipyretic-analgesic activity of acetaminophen.</p>
<p>The combination of propoxyphene and acetaminophen produces greater <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> than that produced by either propoxyphene or acetaminophen administered alone.</p>

<h2>WARNINGS</h2>
<ul class="Disc">
<li><span class="Bold">Do not prescribe propoxyphene for patients who are suicidal or addiction-prone.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bold">Prescribe propoxyphene with caution for patients taking tranquilizers or antidepressant drugs and patients who use alcohol in excess.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bold">Tell your patients not to exceed the recommended dose and to limit their intake of alcohol.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="First">Propoxyphene products, in excessive doses, either alone or in combination with other CNS depressants, including alcohol, are a major cause of drug related <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span>. Fatalities within the first hour of overdosage are not uncommon. In a survey of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> due to overdosage conducted in 1975, in approximately 20% of the fatal cases, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> occurred within the first hour (5% occurred within 15 minutes). Propoxyphene should not be taken in doses higher than those recommended by the physician. The judicious prescribing of propoxyphene is essential to the safe use of this drug. With patients who are depressed or suicidal, consideration should be given to the use of non-narcotic analgesics. Patients should be cautioned about the concomitant use of propoxyphene products and alcohol because of potentially serious CNS-additive effects of these agents. Because of its added depressant effects, propoxyphene should be prescribed with caution for those patients whose medical condition requires the concomitant administration of sedatives, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, antidepressants, or other CNS-depressant drugs. Patients should be advised of the additive depressant effects of these combinations.</p>
<p>Many of the propoxyphene-related <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> have occurred in patients with previous histories of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4305081" conceptname="Emotional problems">emotional disturbances</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4092095" conceptname="Planning suicide">suicidal ideation</span> or attempts as well as histories of misuse of tranquilizers, alcohol, and other CNS-active drugs. Some <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> have occurred as a consequence of the accidental ingestion of excessive quantities of propoxyphene alone or in combination with other drugs. Patients taking propoxyphene should be warned not to exceed the dosage recommended by the physician.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug Dependence</span></h2>
<p class="First">Propoxyphene, when taken in higher-than-recommended doses over long periods of time, can produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">drug dependence</span> characterized by psychic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> and less frequently, physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> and tolerance. Propoxyphene will only partially suppress the withdrawal syndrome in individuals physically dependent on morphine or other narcotics. The abuse liability of propoxyphene is qualitatively similar to that of codeine although quantitatively less, and propoxyphene should be prescribed with the same degree of caution appropriate to the use of codeine.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">The CNS-depressant effect of propoxyphene is additive with that of other CNS depressants, including alcohol.</p>
<p>As in the case with many medicinal agents, propoxyphene may slow the metabolism of a concomitantly administered drug. Should this occur, the higher serum concentrations of that drug may result in increased pharmacologic or adverse effects of the drug. Such occurrences have been reported when propoxyphene was administered to patients on antidepressants, anticonvulsants, or warfarin-like drugs. Severe neurologic signs, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>, have occurred with concurrent use of carbamazepine.</p>

<h2>Usage in Pregnancy</h2>
<p class="First">Safe use in pregnancy has not been established relative to possible adverse effects on fetal development. Instances of withdrawal symptoms in the neonate have been reported following usage during pregnancy. Therefore, propoxyphene should not be used in pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of Propoxyphene Overdosage</h2>
<p class="First">The manifestations of acute overdosage with propoxyphene are those of narcotic overdosage. The patient is usually somnolent but may be stuporous or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">comatose</span> and convulsing. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">Respiratory depression</span> is characteristic. The ventilatory rate and/or tidal volume is decreased, which results in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438555" conceptname="Cyanosis">cyanosis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxia</span>. Pupils, initially pinpoint, may become dilated as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxia</span> increases. Cheyne-Stokes respiration and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span> may occur. Blood pressure and heart rate are usually normal initially, but blood pressure <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falls</span> and cardiac performance deteriorates, which ultimately results in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4078925" conceptname="Pulmonary edema">pulmonary edema</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">circulatory collapse</span>, unless the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> is corrected and adequate ventilation is restored promptly. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">Cardiac arrhythmias</span> and conduction delay may be present. A combined respiratory-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span> occurs owing to retained CO2 (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4105765" conceptname="Hypercapnia">hypercapnia</span>) and to lactic acid formed during anaerobic glycolysis. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">Acidosis</span> may be severe if large amounts of salicylates have also been ingested. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Death</span> may occur.</p>

<h2>Treatment of Propoxyphene Overdosage</h2>
<p class="First">Attention should be directed first to establishing a patent airway and to restoring ventilation. Mechanically assisted ventilation, with or without oxygen, may be required, and positive pressure respiration may be desirable if <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4078925" conceptname="Pulmonary edema">pulmonary edema</span> is present. The narcotic antagonist naloxone will markedly reduce the degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, and 0.4 to 2 mg should be administered promptly, preferably intravenously. If the desired degree of counteraction with improvement in respiratory functions is not obtained, naloxone should be repeated at 2- to 3-minute intervals. The duration of action of the antagonist may be brief. If no response is observed after 10 mg of naloxone have been administered, the diagnosis of propoxyphene toxicity should be questioned. Naloxone may also be administered by continuous intravenous infusion.</p>

<a name="s22"></a><a name="section-9.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Treatment of Propoxyphene Overdosage in Pediatric Patients</h2>
<p class="First">The usual initial dose of naloxone in pediatric patients is 0.01 mg/kg body weight given intravenously. If this dose does not result in the desired degree of clinical improvement, a subsequent increased dose of 0.1 mg/kg body weight may be administered. If an IV route of administration is not available, naloxone may be administered IM or subcutaneously in divided doses. If necessary, naloxone can be diluted with sterile water for injection.</p>
<p>Blood gases, pH, and electrolytes should be monitored in order that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidosis</span> and any <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022093" conceptname="Electrolyte imbalance">electrolyte disturbance</span> present may be corrected promptly. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">Acidosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxia</span>, and generalized <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span> predispose to the development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmias</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437894" conceptname="Ventricular fibrillation">Ventricular fibrillation</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span> may occur and necessitate the full complement of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) measures. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4048509" conceptname="Respiratory acidosis">Respiratory acidosis</span> rapidly subsides as ventilation is restored and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4105765" conceptname="Hypercapnia">hypercapnia</span> eliminated, but <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span> may require intravenous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span> for prompt correction.</p>
<p>Electrocardiographic monitoring is essential.

<p>In addition to the use of a narcotic antagonist, the patient may require careful titration with an anticonvulsant to control <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>. Analeptic drugs (for example, caffeine or amphetamine) should not be used because of their tendency to precipitate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>.</p>
<p>General supportive measures, in addition to oxygen include, when necessary, intravenous fluids, vasopressor-inotropic compounds, and, when <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> is likely, anti-infective agents.

<h2>Treatment of Acetaminophen Overdosage</h2>
<p class="First">Acetaminophen in massive overdosage may cause hepatic toxicity in some patients. In all cases of suspected <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, immediately call your regional poison center or the Rocky Mountain Poison Center's toll-free number (800) 525-6115 for assistance in diagnosis and for directions in the use of N-acetylcysteine as an antidote.</p>
<p>In adults, hepatic toxicity has rarely been reported with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">acute overdoses</span> of less than 10 g and fatalities with less than 15 g. Importantly, young children seem to be more resistant than adults to the hepatotoxic effect of an acetaminophen <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. Despite this, the measures outlined below should be initiated in any adult or pediatric patient suspected of having ingested an acetaminophen <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>.</p>
<p>Because clinical and laboratory evidence of hepatic toxicity may not be apparent until 48 to 72 hours post ingestion, liver function studies should be obtained initially and repeated at 24-hour intervals.</p>
<p>Consider emptying the stomach promptly by lavage or by induction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> with syrup of ipecac. Patients' estimates of the quantity of a drug ingested are notoriously unreliable. Therefore, if an acetaminophen <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> is suspected, a serum acetaminophen assay should be obtained as early as possible, but no sooner than 4 hours following ingestion. The antidote, N-acetylcysteine, should be administered as early as possible, and within 16 hours of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> ingestion for optimal results. Following recovery, there are no residual, structural, or functional hepatic abnormalities.</p>

<h2>Animal Toxicology</h2>
<p class="First">The acute lethal doses of the hydrochloride and napsylate salts of propoxyphene were determined in 4 species. The results shown in <span class="Bold"><a href="#f5">Figure 2</a></span> indicate that, on a molar basis, the napsylate salt is less toxic than the hydrochloride. This may be due to the relative insolubility and retarded absorption of propoxyphene napsylate.</p>
<div class="Figure">
<a name="f5"></a><img alt="Image from Drug Label Content" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=4cf33260-5a78-4207-b113-a9d6771811a3&amp;name=propoxyph-100-500-05.jpg"><p class="MultiMediaCaption">Figure 2</p>
</div>
<p>Some indication of the relative insolubility and retarded absorption of propoxyphene napsylate was obtained by measuring plasma propoxyphene levels in 2 groups of 4 dogs following oral administration of equimolar doses of the 2 salts. As shown in <span class="Bold"><a href="#f6">Figure 3</a></span>, the peak plasma concentration observed with propoxyphene hydrochloride was much higher than that obtained after administration of the napsylate salt.</p>
<p>Although none of the animals in this experiment died, 3 of the 4 dogs given propoxyphene hydrochloride exhibited <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsive seizures</span> during the time interval corresponding to the peak plasma levels. The 4 animals receiving the napsylate salt were mildly ataxic but not acutely ill.</p>

<p>Products containing propoxyphene napsylate are used to relieve <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>.</p>
<p>LIMIT YOUR INTAKE OF ALCOHOL WHILE TAKING THIS DRUG. Make sure your doctor knows if you are taking tranquilizers, sleep aids, antidepressants, antihistamines, or any other drugs that make you <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepy</span>. Combining propoxyphene with alcohol or these drugs in excessive doses is dangerous.</p>
<p>Use care while driving a car or using machines until you see how the drug affects you because propoxyphene can make you <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepy</span>. Do not take more of the drug than your doctor prescribed. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">Dependence</span> has occurred when patients have taken propoxyphene for a long period of time at doses greater than recommended.</p>
<p>The rest of this leaflet gives you more information about propoxyphene. Please read it and keep it for future use.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">USES OF PROPOXYPHENE NAPYSLATE</span></p>
<p>Products containing propoxyphene napsylate are used for the relief of mild to moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>. Products that contain propoxyphene napsylate plus aspirin or acetaminophen are prescribed for the relief of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">BEFORE TAKING PROPOXYPHENE NAPSYLATE</span></p>
<p>Make sure your doctor knows if you have ever had an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergic reaction</span> to propoxyphene, aspirin, or acetaminophen. Some forms of propoxyphene products contain aspirin to help relieve <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>. Your doctor should be advised if you have a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcers</span> or if you are taking an anticoagulant (â€œblood thinnerâ€?). The aspirin may irritate the stomach lining and may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, particularly if an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcer</span> is present. Also, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> may occur if you are taking an anticoagulant. In a small group of people, aspirin may cause an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> attack. If you are one of these people, be sure your drug does not contain aspirin.</p>
<p>The effect of propoxyphene in pediatric patients under 12 has not been studied. Therefore, use of the drug in this age group is not recommended.</p>
<p>Also, due to the possible association between aspirin and Reye Syndrome, those propoxyphene products containing aspirin should not be given to children, including teenagers, with chicken pox or flu unless prescribed by a physician.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">HOW TO TAKE PROPOXYPHENE NAPSYLATE</span></p>
<p>Follow your doctor's directions exactly. Do not increase the amount you take without your doctor's approval. If you miss a dose of the drug, do not take twice as much the next time.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">PREGNANCY</span></p>
<p>DO not take propoxyphene during pregnancy unless you doctor knows you are pregnant and specifically recommends its use. Cases of temporary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> in the newborn have occurred when the mother has taken propoxyphene consistently in the weeks before delivery. As a general principle, no drug should be taken during pregnancy unless it is clearly necessary.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">GENERAL CAUTIONS</span></p>
<p>Heavy use of alcohol with propoxyphene is hazardous and may lead to overdosage symptoms (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#P1">OVERDOSAGE</a></span> below). THEREFORE, LIMIT YOUR INTAKE OF ALCHOHOL WHILE TAKING PROPOXYPHENE.</p>
<p>Combinations of excessive doses of propoxyphene, alcohol, and tranquilizers are dangerous. Make sure your doctor knows if you are taking tranquilizers, sleep aids, antidepressant drugs, antihistamines, or any other drugs that make you <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepy</span>. The use of these drugs with proxyphene increases their sedative effects and may lead to overdosage symptoms, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#P1">OVERDOSAGE</a></span> below).</p>
<p>Propoxyphene may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> or impair your mental and/or physician abilities, therefore, use caution when driving a vehicle or operating dangerous machinery. DO NOT perform any hazardous tasks until you have seen your response to this drug.</p>
<p>Propoxyphene may increase the concentration of medications in the body, such as anticoagulants (â€œblood thinnersâ€?), antidepressants, or drugs used for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>. The result may be excessive or adverse effects of these medications. Make sure your doctor knows if you are taking any of these medications.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></span></p>
<p>You can become dependent on propoxyphene if you take it in higher than recommended doses over a long period of time. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">Dependence</span> is a feeling of need for the drug and a feeling that you cannot perform normally without it.</p>
<p><a name="P1"></a><span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span></p>
<p>An <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> of propoxyphene napsylate, alone or with other drugs, including alcohol, may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">weakness</span>, difficulty in breathing, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, and more severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>.</p>
