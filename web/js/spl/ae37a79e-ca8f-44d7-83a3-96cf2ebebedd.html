<h2>Hydrocodone Component
</h2>
<p class="First">Hydrocodone is a semisynthetic opioid analgesic and antitussive with multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of codeine. Most of these involve the central nervous system and smooth muscle. The precise mechanism of action of hydrocodone and other opioids is not known, although it is believed to relate to the existence of opiate receptors in the central nervous system. In addition to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, opioids may produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, changes in mood, and mental clouding.
</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s4"></a><a name="section-3.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Ibuprofen Component
</h2>
<p class="First">Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent that possesses analgesic and antipyretic activities. Its mode of action, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood, but may be related to inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity and prostaglandin synthesis. Ibuprofen is a peripherally acting analgesic. Ibuprofen does not have any known effects on opiate receptors.

<h2>Pharmacokinetics
</h2>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s6"></a><a name="section-3.3.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Absorption
</h3>
<p class="First">After oral dosing with the REPREXAIN™ tablet, a peak hydrocodone plasma level of 27 ng/mL is achieved at 1.7 hours, and a peak ibuprofen plasma level of 30 mcg/mL is achieved at 1.8 hours. The effect of food on the absorption of either component from the REPREXAIN™ tablet has not been established.
</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s7"></a><a name="section-3.3.2"></a><p></p>
<h3>Distribution
</h3>
<p class="First">Ibuprofen is highly protein-bound (99%) like most other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Although the extent of protein binding of hydrocodone in human plasma has not been definitely determined, structural similarities to related opioid analgesics suggest that hydrocodone is not extensively protein bound. As most agents in the 5-ring morphinan group of semi-synthetic opioids bind plasma protein to a similar degree (range 19% [hydromorphone] to 45% [oxycodone]), hydrocodone is expected to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> within this range.
</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s8"></a><a name="section-3.3.3"></a><p></p>
<h3>Metabolism
</h3>
<p class="First">Hydrocodone exhibits a complex pattern of metabolism, including <span class="Italics">O</span>-demethylation, <span class="Italics">N</span>­demethylation, and 6-keto reduction to the corresponding 6-α-and 6-β-hydroxy metabolites. Hydromorphone, a potent opioid, is formed from the <span class="Italics">O</span>-demethylation of hydrocodone and contributes to the total <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span> of hydrocodone. The <span class="Italics">O</span>-and <span class="Italics">N</span>-­demethylation processes are mediated by separate P-450 isoenzymes: CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, respectively.
</p>
<p>Ibuprofen is present in this product as a racemate, and following absorption it undergoes interconversion in the plasma from the R-isomer to the S-isomer. Both the R- and S- isomers are metabolized to two primary metabolites: (+)-2-4'-(2hydroxy-2-methyl-propyl) phenyl propionic acid and (+)-2-4'-(2carboxypropyl) phenyl propionic acid, both of which circulate in the plasma at low levels relative to the parent.
</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s9"></a><a name="section-3.3.4"></a><p></p>
<h3>Elimination
</h3>
<p class="First">Hydrocodone and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in the kidneys, with a mean plasma half-life of 4.5 hours. Ibuprofen is excreted in the urine, 50% to 60% as metabolites and approximately 15% as unchanged drug and conjugate. The plasma half-life is 2.2 hours.

<h2>CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS
</h2>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s17"></a><a name="section-7.1.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events
</h3>
<p class="First">Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.
</p>
<p>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI events (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s24">GI WARNINGS</a></span>).
</p>
<p>Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s14">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span> ).

</h2>
<p class="First">NSAID-containing products, including REPREXAIN™, can lead to onset of new <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> or worsening of pre-existing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events.

<h2>Misuse Abuse and Diversion of Opioids
</h2>
<p class="First">REPREXAIN™ contains hydrocodone an opioid agonist, and is a Schedule II controlled substance. Opioid agonists have the potential for being abused and are sought by abusers and people with addiction disorders, and are subject to diversion.
</p>
<p>REPREXAIN™ can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing REPREXAIN™ in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse or diversion (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s62">DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></a></span>).

<h2>Gastrointestinal (GI) Effects - Risk of GI Ulceration, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">Bleeding</span> and Perforation
</h2>
<p class="First">NSAIDs, including REPREXAIN™, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develops a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcers</span>, gross <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk.
</p>
<p>NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcer</span> disease or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">gastrointestinal bleeding</span>. Patients with a <span class="Italics">prior history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4027663" conceptname="Peptic ulcer">peptic ulcer disease</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">gastrointestinal bleeding</span> who</span> use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">GI bleed</span> compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.
</p>
<p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high-risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly.

<h2>General
</h2>
<p class="First">REPREXAIN™ cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids.

<h2>Hepatic Effects
</h2>
<p class="First">Borderline elevations of one or more liver enzymes may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including ibuprofen as found in REPREXAIN™. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain essentially unchanged, or may be transient with continued therapy. Notable elevations of SGPT (ALT) or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4094657" conceptname="Aspartate aminotransferase">SGOT</span> (AST) (approximately three or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDS.

<h3>Antidepressants
</h3>
<p class="First">The use of Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) or tricyclic antidepressants with REPREXAIN™ may increase the effect of either the antidepressant or hydrocodone.

<h3>Diuretics
</h3>
<p class="First">Ibuprofen has been shown to reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with REPREXAIN™ the patient should be observed closely for signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s25">WARNINGS - Renal Effects</a></span>), as well as diuretic efficacy.

<h3>Lithium
</h3>
<p class="First">Ibuprofen has been shown to elevate plasma lithium concentration and reduce renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by ibuprofen. Thus, when REPREXAIN™ and lithium are administered concurrently, patients should be observed for signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium toxicity</span>.

<h4>Teratogenic Effects
</h4>
<p class="First">Reproductive studies conducted in rats and rabbits have not demonstrated evidence of developmental abnormalities.
</p>
<p>REPREXAIN™, administered to rabbits at 95 mg/kg (5.72 and 1.9 times the maximum clinical dose based on body weight and surface area, respectively), a maternally toxic dose, resulted in an increase in the percentage of litters and fetuses with any major abnormality and an increase in the number of litters and fetuses with one or more nonossified metacarpals (a minor abnormality). REPREXAIN™, administered to rats at 166 mg/kg (10 and 1.66 times the maximum clinical dose based on body weight and surface area, respectively), a maternally toxic dose, did not result in any reproductive toxicity. However, animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. REPREXAIN™ should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

<p class="First">Because of the known effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of the ductus arteriosus), use during pregnancy (particularly late pregnancy) should be avoided. Babies born to mothers who have been taking opioids regularly prior to delivery will be physically dependent. The withdrawal signs include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span> and excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4136768" conceptname="Crying">crying</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremors</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">hyperactive</span> reflexes, increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4313591" conceptname="Respiratory rate">respiratory rate</span>, increased stools, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4328356" conceptname="Sneezing">sneezing</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089239" conceptname="Yawning">yawning</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>. The intensity of the syndrome does not always correlate with the duration of maternal opioid use or dose. There is no consensus on the best method of managing withdrawal.

<h2>Labor and Delivery
</h2>
<p class="First">As with other drugs known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, an increased incidence of dystocia and delayed parturition occurred in rats. Administration of REPREXAIN™ is not recommended during labor and delivery. The effects of REPREXAIN™ on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown.

<h2>Nursing Mothers
</h2>
<p class="First">It is not known whether hydrocodone is excreted in human milk. In limited studies, an assay capable of detecting 1 mcg/mL did not demonstrate ibuprofen in the milk of lactating mothers. However, because of the limited nature of the studies, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from REPREXAIN™, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS
</h1>
<p class="First">REPREXAIN™ was administered to approximately 300 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> patients in a safety study that employed dosages and a duration of treatment sufficient to encompass the recommended usage (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s69">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>). Adverse event rates generally increased with increasing daily dose. The event rates reported below are from approximately 150 patients who were in a group that received one tablet of REPREXAIN™ an average of three to four times daily. The overall incidence rates of adverse experiences in the trials were fairly similar for this patient group and those who received the comparison treatment, acetaminophen 600 mg with codeine 60 mg.
</p>
<p>The following lists adverse events that occurred with an incidence of 1% or greater in clinical trials of REPREXAIN™, without regard to the causal relationship of the events to the drug. To distinguish different rates of occurrence in clinical studies, the adverse events are listed as follows:

<h2>Misuse Abuse and Diversion of Opioids
</h2>
<p class="First">REPREXAIN™ contains hydrocodone, an opioid agonist, and is a Schedule II controlled substance. REPREXAIN™, and other opioids used in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> can be abused and are subject to criminal diversion.
</p>
<p>Addiction is a primary, chronic, neurobiologic disease, with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations. It is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following: impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug addiction</span> is a treatable disease utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common.
</p>
<p>“Drug seeking? behavior is very common in addicts and drug abusers. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated “loss? of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). “Doctor shopping? to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction.
</p>
<p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> and tolerance. Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> usually assumes clinically significant dimensions only after several weeks of continued opioid use, although a mild degree of physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> may develop after a few days of opioid therapy. Tolerance, in which increasingly large doses are required in order to produce the same degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, is manifested initially by a shortened duration of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span>, and subsequently by decreases in the intensity of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>. The rate of development of tolerance varies among patients. Physicians should be aware that abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction and is characterized by misuse for non-medical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. REPREXAIN™, like other opioids, may be diverted for non-­medical use. Record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised.
</p>
<p>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.

<h2>Treatment
</h2>
<p class="First">Primary attention should be given to the re-establishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and the institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Naloxone, a narcotic antagonist, can reverse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span> associated with opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> or unusual sensitivity to opioids, including hydrocodone. Therefore, an appropriate dose of naloxone hydrochloride should be administered intravenously with simultaneous efforts at respiratory resuscitation. Since the duration of action of hydrocodone may exceed that of the naloxone, the patient should be kept under continuous surveillance and repeated doses of the antagonist should be administered as needed to maintain adequate respiration. Supportive measures should be employed as indicated. Gastric emptying may be useful in removing unabsorbed drug. In cases where consciousness is impaired it may be inadvisable to perform gastric lavage. If gastric lavage is performed, little drug will likely be recovered if more than an hour has elapsed since ingestion. Ibuprofen is acidic and is excreted in the urine; therefore, it may be beneficial to administer alkali and induce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span>. In addition to supportive measures the use of oral activated charcoal may help to reduce the absorption and reabsorption of ibuprofen. Dialysis is not likely to be effective for removal of ibuprofen because it is very highly bound to plasma proteins.

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</h1>
<p class="First">Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of REPREXAIN™ and other treatment options before deciding to use REPREXAIN™. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s15">WARNINGS</a></span>).
</p>
<p>After observing the response to initial therapy with REPREXAIN™, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.
</p>
<p>For the short-term (generally less than 10 days) management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433456" conceptname="Acute pain">acute pain</span>, the recommended dose of REPREXAIN™ is one tablet every 4 to 6 hours, as necessary. Dosage should not exceed 5 tablets in a 24-hour period. It should be kept in mind that tolerance to hydrocodone can develop with continued use and that the incidence of untoward effects is dose related.
</p>
<p>The lowest effective dose or the longest dosing interval should be sought for each patient (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s15">WARNINGS</a></span>), especially in the elderly. After observing the initial response to therapy with REPREXAIN™, the dose and frequency of dosing should be adjusted to suit the individual patient's need, without exceeding the total daily dose recommended.
