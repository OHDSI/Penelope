<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen tablets USP contain 
propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen.</p>
<p>Propoxyphene napsylate is an odorless, white crystalline powder with a bitter 
taste. It is very slightly soluble in water, soluble in methanol, in ethanol, in 
chloroform, and in acetone. Chemically it is (α<span class="Italics">S</span>,1<span class="Italics">R</span>)-α-[2-(dimethylamino)-1-methylethyl]-α-phenylphenethyl 
propionate compound with 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid (1:1) monohydrate and can be 
represented by the following structural formula:</p>

<p>Propoxyphene napsylate differs from propoxyphene hydrochloride in that it 
allows more stable liquid dosage forms and tablet formulations. Because of 
differences in molecular weight, a dose of 100 mg (176.8 μmol) of propoxyphene 
napsylate is required to supply an amount of propoxyphene equivalent to that 
present in 65 mg (172.9 μmol) of propoxyphene hydrochloride.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen, 4'-hydroxyacetanilide, is a non-opiate, non-salicylate 
analgesic and antipyretic which occurs as a white, odorless, crystalline powder, 
possessing a slightly bitter taste. Chemically, it is acetamide, <span class="Italics">N</span>-(4-hydroxyphenyl)- and can structurally be represented by 
the following:</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<span class="Bold">Pharmacology</span><p class="First">Propoxyphene is a centrally acting opiate analgesic. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies demonstrated propoxyphene and the 
metabolite norpropoxyphene inhibit sodium channels (local anesthetic effect) 
with norpropoxyphene being approximately 2 fold more potent than propoxyphene 
and propoxyphene approximately 10 fold more potent than lidocaine. Propoxyphene 
and norpropoxyphene inhibit the voltage-gated potassium current carried by 
cardiac rapidly activating delayed rectifier (hERG) channels with approximately 
equal potency. It is unclear if the effects on ion channels occur within 
therapeutic dose range.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen is a non-opiate, non-salicylate analgesic and antipyretic. The 
site and mechanism for the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span> of acetaminophen has not been 
determined. The antipyretic effect of acetaminophen is mediated through activity 
in the hypothalamic heat-regulating centers. Acetaminophen inhibits 
prostaglandin synthetase. Therapeutic doses of acetaminophen have negligible 
effects on the cardiovascular or respiratory systems; however, toxic doses may 
cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443240" conceptname="Collapse">circulatory failure</span> and rapid, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302536" conceptname="Shallow breathing">shallow breathing</span>.</p>

<a name="section-2.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<span class="Italics">Absorption</span><p class="First">Peak plasma concentrations of propoxyphene are reached in 2 to 
2.5 h. After a 65 mg oral dose of propoxyphene hydrochloride, peak plasma levels 
of 0.05 to 0.1 mcg/mL for propoxyphene and 0.1 to 0.2 mcg/mL for norpropoxyphene 
(major metabolite) are achieved. Repeated doses of propoxyphene at 6 h intervals 
lead to increasing plasma concentrations, with a plateau after the ninth dose at 
48 h. Propoxyphene has a half-life of 6 to 12 h, whereas that of norpropoxyphene 
is 30 to 36 h.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and has a plasma 
half-life of 1.25 to 3 h, which may be increased by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver damage</span> and following 
overdosage.</p>
<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><span class="Italics">Distribution</span><p>Propoxyphene is about 80% bound to proteins and has a large 
volume of distribution, 16 L/kg.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen is relatively uniformly distributed throughout most body 
fluids. Binding of the drug to plasma proteins is variable; only 20% to 50% may 
be bound at the concentrations encountered during acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>.</p>
<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span><p>Propoxyphene undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism by 
intestinal and hepatic enzymes. The major route of metabolism is cytochrome 
CYP3A4 mediated N-demethylation to norpropoxyphene, which is excreted by the 
kidneys. Ring hydroxylation and glucuronide formation are minor metabolic 
pathways.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen is extensively metabolized in the liver. Less than 5% of 
acetaminophen dose is excreted unchanged in the kidney. About 85% of an 
acetaminophen dose is metabolized by conjugation, mainly glucuronidation via 
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (mainly UGT1A6) and to a lesser extent sulfation via 
sulfotransferase (mainly SLT1A1 and SLT1A3). The glucuronide and sulfate 
conjugates are nontoxic and are largely excreted in the urine and bile. About 8 
to 10% of an acetaminophen dose is oxidized by cytochrome CYP2E1 to form the 
toxic reactive intermediate, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI is 
further metabolized via glutathione (GSH) conjugation, yielding non-toxic thiol 
metabolites including cysteine, mercapturate, methylthioacetaminophen, and 
methanesulfinylacetaminophen that are excreted in the urine. Acetaminophen is 
also oxidized at a low percentage by cytochrome CYP2A6 to form inert catechols 
(e.g., methoxyacetaminophen).</p>
<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><span class="Italics">Excretion</span><p>In 48 h, approximately 20 to 25% of the administered dose of 
propoxyphene is excreted via the urine, most of which is free or conjugated 
norpropoxyphene. The renal clearance rate of propoxyphene is 2.6 L/min.</p>
<p>Elimination of acetaminophen is principally by liver metabolism (conjugation) 
and subsequent renal excretion of metabolites. Approximately 85% of an oral dose 
appears in the urine within 24 hours of administration, most as the glucuronide 
conjugate, with small amounts of other conjugates and unchanged drug.</p>

<h2>SPECIAL POPULATIONS</h2>
<span class="Bold">Geriatric Patients</span><p class="First">After oral administration of propoxyphene in elderly patients (70 
to 78 years), much longer half-lives of propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene have 
been reported (propropoxyphene 13 to 35 h, norpropoxyphene 22 to 41 h). In 
addition, the AUC was an average of 3 fold higher and the C<span class="Sub">max</span> was an average of 2.5 fold higher in the elderly when 
compared to a younger (20 to 28 years) population. Longer dosage intervals may 
be considered in the elderly because the metabolism of propoxyphene may be 
reduced in this patient population. After multiple oral doses of propoxyphene in 
elderly patients (70 to 78 years), the C<span class="Sub">max</span> of the 
metabolite (norpropoxyphene) was increased 5 fold.</p>
<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients</span><p>Neither propoxyphene alone nor in combination with acetaminophen 
has been studied in pediatric patients.</p>
<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic Impairment</span></span><p>No formal pharmacokinetic study of either propoxyphene alone or 
in combination with acetaminophen has been conducted in patients with mild, 
moderate or severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>.</p>
<p>After oral administration of propoxyphene in patients with cirrhosis, plasma 
concentrations of propoxyphene were considerably higher and norpropoxyphene 
concentrations were much lower than in control patients. This is presumably 
because of a decreased first-pass metabolism of orally administered propoxyphene 
in these patients. The AUC ratio of norpropoxyphene: propoxyphene was 
significantly lower in patients with cirrhosis (0.5 to 0.9) than in controls 
(2.5 to 4).</p>
<p>Compared to healthy subjects, acetaminophen had a lower total clearance and 
longer half-life in patients with liver disease. Decreased metabolite formation 
clearance (8 to 42%) was observed in subjects with liver disease compared to 
healthy subjects after both single and multiple-doses (at steady state). In 
addition, there is an increase in the amount of acetaminophen excreted unchanged 
in the urine (4.7% vs. 2.5%) in patients with liver disease compared to healthy 
subjects after repeat doses, suggesting that more acetaminophen was excreted by 
renal elimination in the liver disease state.</p>

in combination with acetaminophen has been conducted in patients with mild, 
moderate or severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>.</p>
<p>After oral administration of propoxyphene in anephric patients, the AUC and 
C<span class="Sub">max</span> values were an average of 76% and 88% greater, 
respectively. Dialysis removes only insignificant amounts (8%) of administered 
dose of propoxyphene.</p>
<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span><p>The metabolism of propoxyphene may be altered by strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, 
clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, 
diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, grapefruit juice, and 
verapamil) leading to enhanced propoxyphene plasma levels. On the other hand, 
strong CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin may lead to enhanced metabolite 
(norpropoxyphene) levels.</p>
<p>Propoxyphene is also thought to possess CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme inhibiting 
properties. Coadministration with a drug that is a substrate of CYP3A4 or 
CYP2D6, may result in higher plasma concentrations and increased pharmacologic 
or adverse effects of that drug.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions With Propoxyphene</h2>
<p class="First">Propoxyphene is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 
3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4), therefore potential interactions may occur when 
propoxyphene is administered concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 
activity.</p>
<p>The metabolism of propoxyphene may be altered by strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
(such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, 
nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, 
erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, grapefruit juice, and verapamil) 
leading to enhanced propoxyphene plasma levels. Coadministration with agents 
that induce CYP3A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of propoxyphene. Strong 
CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin may lead to enhanced metabolite 
(norpropoxyphene) levels.</p>
<p>Propoxyphene is also thought to possess CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme inhibiting 
properties and coadministration with drugs that rely on either of these enzymes 
for metabolism may result in increased pharmacologic or adverse effects of that 
drug. Severe neurologic signs, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>, have occurred with concurrent use 
of carbamazepine (metabolized by CYP3A4).</p>
<p>Increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> has been observed with warfarin-like agents when 
given along with propoxyphene; however, the mechanistic basis of this

<p><span class="Underline">Beta Blockers (Propranolol)</span>: Propranolol appears 
to inhibit the enzyme systems responsible for the glucuronidation and oxidation 
of acetaminophen. Therefore, the pharmacologic effects of acetaminophen may be 
increased.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Loop Diuretics</span>: The effects of the loop diuretic 
may be decreased because acetaminophen may decrease renal prostaglandin 
excretion and decrease plasma renin activity.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>Propoxyphene, norpropoxyphene (major metabolite), and acetaminophen are excreted 
in human milk. Published studies of nursing mothers using propoxyphene detected 
no adverse effects in nursing infants. Based on a study of six mother-infant 
pairs, an exclusively breastfed infant receives approximately 2% of the maternal 
weight-adjusted dose. Norpropoxyphene is renally excreted and renal clearance is 
lower in neonates than in adults. Therefore, it is possible that prolonged 
maternal propoxyphene use could result in norpropoxyphene accumulation in a 
breastfed infant. Watch breastfeeding infants for signs of sedation including 
poor feeding, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>.

suggest that patients over the age of 65 may be more susceptible to CNS-related 
side effects. Therefore, dose selection for an elderly patient should be 
cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the 
greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of 
concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Decreased total daily dosage should 
be considered <span class="Bold">(see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</span>

acetaminophen tablets can produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">drug dependence</span> of the morphine type, and 
therefore, has the potential for being abused. Psychic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>, physical 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> and tolerance may develop upon repeated administration. Propoxyphene

medications.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42227-9">

<h2>Abuse</h2>Since propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen tablets are a mu-opioid agonist, 
they may be subject to misuse, abuse, and addiction. Addiction to opioids 
prescribed for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> management has not been estimated. However, requests for 
opioids from opioid-addicted patients occur. As such, physicians should take 
appropriate care in prescribing propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen 
tablets.</div>

<p class="First">Opioid analgesics may cause psychological and physical 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>. Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> results in withdrawal symptoms in patients who 
abruptly discontinue the drug after long term administration. Also, symptoms of 
withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with 
mu-opioid antagonist activity, e.g., naloxone or mixed agonist/antagonist 
analgesics (pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine, dezocine) (see <span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span>). Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> usually does not occur to a 
clinically significant degree, until after several weeks of continued opioid 
usage. Tolerance, in which increasingly larger doses are required to produce the 
same degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, is initially manifested by a shortened duration of an 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span> and subsequently, by decreases in the intensity of 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>.</p>
<p>In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436096" conceptname="Chronic pain">chronic pain</span> patients, and in opioid-tolerant cancer patients, the 
administration of propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen tablets should be

<p>The severity of the propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen tablets 
abstinence syndrome may depend on the degree of physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>. Withdrawal

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Proproxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen tablets USP are 
intended for the management of mild to moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>. The dose should be

patient size.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen tablets USP (100 mg 
propoxyphene napsylate and 650 mg acetaminophen)</span></p>
<p>The usual dosage is one tablet every 4 hours orally as needed for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>. The 
maximum dose of propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen tablets USP is 6 
tablets per day. <span class="Bold">Do not exceed the maximum daily dose.</span></p>
<p>Patients receiving propoxyphene and any CYP3A4 inhibitor should be carefully 
monitored for an extended period of time and dosage adjustments should be made

<h2>Cessation of Therapy</h2>For patients who used propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen tablets USP on a 
regular basis for a period of time, when therapy with propoxyphene napsylate and 
acetaminophen tablets USP is no longer needed for the treatment of their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, 
it may be useful to gradually discontinue the propoxyphene napsylate and 
acetaminophen tablets USP over time to prevent the development of an opioid 
abstinence syndrome (narcotic withdrawal). In general, therapy can be decreased 
by 25% to 50% per day with careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of 
withdrawal (see <span class="Bold">DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></span> for 
description of the signs and symptoms of withdrawal). If the patient develops

titrated down more slowly, either by increasing the interval between decreases, 
decreasing the amount of change in dose, or both.</div>
