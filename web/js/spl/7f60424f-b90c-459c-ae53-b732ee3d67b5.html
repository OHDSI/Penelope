<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></p>
<p>Fosinopril and fosinoprilat inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and in animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. Hypertensive patients treated with fosinopril alone for an average of 8 weeks had elevations of serum potassium of approximately 0.1 mEq/L. Similar patients treated with hydrochlorothiazide alone had a mean reduction in serum potassium of 0.15 mEq/L, while patients who received combined treatment with 10/12.5 mg or 20/12.5 mg of fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide had reductions of 0.07 and 0.03 mEq/L, respectively. (See <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>.)</p>
<p>Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on rennin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. </p>
<p>ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of Fosinopril Sodium and Hydrochlorothiazide tablets remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>While the mechanism through which fosinopril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, fosinopril has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with low-renin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>.</p>
<p>Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin, so coadministration of an ACE inhibitor tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.</p>
<p>The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</span></p>
<p>The absolute absorption of fosinopril averages 36% of an oral dose. The primary site of absorption is the proximal small intestine. While the rate of absorption may be slowed by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract, the extent of absorption of fosinopril is essentially unaffected. </p>
<p>Following oral administration of hydrochlorothiazide, peak plasma concentrations are achieved in 1-2.5 hours, and the extent of absorption is 50-80%. The reported studies of food effects on hydrochlorothiazide absorption have been inconclusive. The absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is increased by agents that reduce gastrointestinal motility. It is reported to be decreased by 50% in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>. </p>
<p>Cleavage of the ester group (primarily in the liver) converts fosinopril to its active metabolite, fosinoprilat. The time to peak plasma concentrations of fosinoprilat is about 3 hours, independent of the administered dose of fosinopril. In patients with hepatic dysfunction due to cirrhosis, conversion of fosinopril to fosinoprilat may be slowed, but the extent of this conversion is unchanged.</p>
<p>Fosinoprilat is highly protein bound (95%), but has negligible binding to cellular components of blood. The peak serum concentration and the area under the concentration-time curve of fosinoprilat is directly proportional to the administered dose of fosinopril. </p>
<p>After an oral dose of radiolabeled fosinopril, 75% of radioactivity in plasma was present as active fosinoprilat, 20-30% as a glucuronide conjugate of fosinoprilat, and 1-5% as a <span class="Italics">p</span>-hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat. Since fosinoprilat is not biotransformed after intravenous administration, fosinopril, not fosinoprilat, appears to be the precursor for the glucuronide and <span class="Italics">p</span>-hydroxy metabolites. In rats, the <span class="Italics">p</span>-hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat is as potent an inhibitor of ACE as fosinoprilat; the glucuronide conjugate is devoid of ACE inhibitory activity.</p>
<p>Studies in animals indicate that fosinopril and fosinoprilat do not cross the blood-brain barrier, but fosinoprilat does cross the placenta of pregnant animals. In humans, hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta freely, and levels in umbilical-cord blood are similar to those in the maternal circulation.</p>
<p>Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized. Its apparent volume of distribution is 3.6-7.8 L/kg, and its measured plasma protein binding is 67.9%. The drug also accumulates in red blood cells, so that whole blood levels are 1.6-1.8 times those measured in plasma.</p>
<p>After intravenous administration, fosinoprilat is eliminated approximately equally by the liver and kidney. After oral administration of radiolabeled fosinopril, approximately half of the absorbed dose is excreted in the urine and the remainder is excreted in the feces. In two studies involving healthy subjects, the mean body clearance of intravenous fosinoprilat was between 26 and 39 mL/min. </p>
<p>In hypertensive patients with normal renal and hepatic function, the effective half-life of accumulation of fosinoprilat following multiple dosing of fosinopril sodium is 11.5 hours. Thus, steady-state concentrations of fosinoprilat should be reached after 2 or 3 doses of Fosinopril Sodium and Hydrochlorothiazide given once daily.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span></span> (creatinine clearance &lt;80 mL/min/l.73m<span class="Sup">2</span>), the total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one half of that in patients with normal renal function, while absorption, bioavailability, and protein binding are not appreciably altered. The clearance of fosinoprilat does not differ appreciably with the degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>, because the diminished renal elimination is offset by increased hepatobiliary elimination. A modest increase in plasma AUC levels (less than two times that in normals) was observed in patients with various degrees of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>, including endstage <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> (creatinine clearance &lt;10 mL/min/1.73m<span class="Sup">2</span>). (See <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>.)</p>
<p>Fosinopril is not well dialyzed. Clearance of fosinoprilat by hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis averages 2% and 7%, respectively, of urea clearances.</p>
<p>In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic insufficiency</span> (alcoholic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192675" conceptname="Biliary cirrhosis">biliary cirrhosis</span>), the apparent total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one half of that in patients with normal hepatic function.</p>
<p>In elderly (male) subjects (65-74 years old) with clinically normal renal and hepatic function, there appear to be no significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters for fosinoprilat compared to those of younger subjects (20-35 years old).</p>
<p>Thiazide diuretics are eliminated by the kidney, with a terminal half-life of 5-15 hours. In a study of patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> (mean creatine clearance of 19 mL/min), the half-life of hydrochlorothiazide elimination was lengthened to 21 hours.</p>
<p>When fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide are administered concomitantly, the pharmacokinetics of hydrochlorothiazide are essentially unaffected. Serum levels of fosinoprilat are increased after several weeks of coadministration of hydrochlorothiazide and fosinopril, but the increase is not sufficient to warrant any change in dosing.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pharmacodynamics</span></p>
<p>After single doses of 10 to 40 mg of fosinopril, serum ACE activity was inhibited by at least 90% from 2 to 12 hours after dosing. At 24 hours, serum ACE activity remains suppressed by 85-93%.</p>
<p>Administration of fosinopril to patients with mild to moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>. In studies in hypertensive patients after three months of fosinopril monotherapy, hemodynamic responses to various stimuli (isometric exercise, 45° head-up tilt, mental challenges) were unchanged compared to baseline, suggesting that fosinopril did not affect the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Instead, fosinopril-induced reduction in blood pressure appears to be mediated by a reduction in peripheral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span> without reflex cardiac effects. In similar studies, renal, splanchnic, cerebral, and skeletal- muscle blood flows were all unchanged compared to baseline, as was glomerular filtration rate. Symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span> is infrequent, although it can occur in patients who are salt- and/or volume-depleted (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p>
<p>Following oral administration of single doses of 10-40 mg, fosinopril <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314171" conceptname="Low blood pressure reading">lowered blood pressure</span> within one hour, with peak reductions achieved 2-6 hours after dosing. The antihypertensive effect of a single dose persisted for 24 hours. Following four weeks of monotherapy in placebo-controlled trials in patients with mild to moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, once-daily doses of 20-80 mg lowered supine or seated blood pressures (systolic/diastolic) 24 hours after dosing by an average of 8-9/6-7 mmHg more than placebo. The trough effect was about 50-60% of the peak diastolic response and about 80% of the peak systolic response.</p>
<p>In clinical studies of various combinations that included 0-40 mg of fosinopril and 0-37.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide, the antihypertensive effects were increased with increasing dose of either component. Peak blood pressure reductions were achieved 2-6 hours after dosing. The mean reductions in seated blood pressure (systolic/diastolic) associated with fosinopril sodium-hydrochlorothiazide tablets 10/12.5 after 24 hours were 9-18/5-7 mmHg greater than those associated with placebo; those associated with fosinopril sodium-hydrochlorothiazide 20/12.5 after 24 hours were 12-17/8-10 mmHg greater than those associated with placebo. These trough effects were 60-90% of the corresponding peak effects.</p>
<p>Although hydrochlorothiazide tends to be more effective in lowrenin hypertensive patients (mainly blacks), and fosinopril—like other ACE inhibitors—tends to be more effective in high-renin patients (mainly non-blacks), the effectiveness of Fosinopril Sodium and Hydrochlorothiazide is independent of race, age, and gender.</p>

<p>Fosinopril Sodium and Hydrochlorothiazide can cause symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>. Like other ACE inhibitors, fosinopril has been only rarely associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> in uncomplicated hypertensive patients. Symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume- and/or salt-depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>.

<p>Fosinopril Sodium and Hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be used cautiously in patients receiving concomitant therapy with other antihypertensives. The thiazide component of Fosinopril Sodium and Hydrochlorothiazide may potentiate the action of other antihypertensive drugs, especially ganglionic or peripheral adrenergic-blocking drugs.

<p>When the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is inhibited by ACE inhibitors, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with <span class="Bold">severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span></span>, whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (including fosinopril) may be associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306451" conceptname="Oliguria">oliguria</span> and/or progressive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4261202" conceptname="Uremia">azotemia</span> and (rarely) with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.</p>
<p>In some studies of hypertensive patients with <span class="Bold">unilateral or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118795" conceptname="Renal artery stenosis">bilateral renal artery stenosis</span></span>, treatment with ACE inhibitors has been associated with increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine; these increases were reversible upon discontinuation of ACE inhibitor therapy, concomitant diuretic therapy, or both. When such patients are treated with Fosinopril Sodium and Hydrochlorothiazide, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy. </p>
<p>Some ACE-inhibitor-treated hypertensive patients with <span class="Bold">no apparent preexisting renal vascular disease </span>have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when the ACE inhibitor has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. Dosage reduction of Fosinopril Sodium and Hydrochlorothiazide may be required. <span class="Bold">Evaluation of the hypertensive patient should always include assessment of renal function </span>(see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p>

<p><span class="Bold">Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality</span></p>
<p>ACE inhibitors can cause fetal and neonatal morbidity and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> when administered to pregnant women. Several dozen cases have been reported in the world literature. When pregnancy is detected, Fosinopril Sodium and Hydrochlorothiazide should be discontinued as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The use of ACE inhibitors during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy has been associated with fetal and neonatal injury, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, neonatal skull hypoplasia, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090272" conceptname="Anuria">anuria</span>, reversible or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198185" conceptname="Chronic renal failure">irreversible renal failure</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">Oligohydramnios</span> has also been reported, presumably resulting from decreased fetal renal function; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> in this setting has been associated with fetal limb <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208264" conceptname="Muscle contracture">contractures</span>, craniofacial deformation, and hypoplastic lung development. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439128" conceptname="Extreme immaturity">Prematurity</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80204" conceptname="Fetal growth restriction">intrauterine growth retardation</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315922" conceptname="Patent ductus arteriosus">patent ductus arteriosus</span> have also been reported, although it is not clear whether these occurrences were due to the ACE-inhibitor exposure.</p>
<p>These adverse effects do not appear to have resulted from intrauterine ACE-inhibitor exposure that has been limited to the first trimester. Mothers whose embryos and fetuses are exposed to ACE inhibitors only during the first trimester should be so informed. Nonetheless, when patients become pregnant, physicians should make every effort to discontinue the use of fosinopril as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Rarely (probably less often than once in every thousand pregnancies), no alternative to ACE inhibitors will be found. In these rare cases, the mothers should be apprised of the potential hazards to their fetuses, and serial ultrasound examinations should be performed to assess the intraamniotic environment.</p>
<p>If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> is observed, fosinopril should be discontinued unless it is considered life-saving for the mother. Contraction stress testing (CST), a non-stress test (NST), or biophysical profiling (BPP) may be appropriate, depending upon the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. </p>
<p>Infants with histories of <span class="Italics">in utero</span> exposure to ACE inhibitors should be closely observed for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306451" conceptname="Oliguria">oliguria</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span>. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306451" conceptname="Oliguria">oliguria</span> occurs, attention should be directed toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion.Exchange transfusion or peritoneal dialysis may be required as a means of reversing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> and/or substituting for disordered renal function. Fosinopril is poorly dialyzed from the circulation of adults, and indeed there is no experience with any procedure for removing fosinopril from the neonatal circulation, but limited experience with other ACE inhibitors has not shown that such removal is central to the treatment of these infants. </p>
<p>When fosinopril is given to pregnant rats at doses about 80 to 250 times (on a mg/kg basis) the maximum recommended human dose, three similar orofacial malformations and one fetus with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="193306" conceptname="Situs inversus viscerum">situs inversus</span> were observed among the offspring. In pregnant rabbits, no teratogenic effects of fosinopril were seen in studies at doses up to 25 times (on a mg/kg basis) the maximum recommended human dose.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Impaired Hepatic Function</span></p>
<p>Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that begins with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185719" conceptname="Cholestatic jaundice syndrome">cholestatic jaundice</span> and progresses to fulminant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4337543" conceptname="Hepatic necrosis">hepatic necrosis</span> and (sometimes) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. A patient receiving Fosinopril Sodium and Hydrochlorothiazide who develops <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span> or marked elevation of hepatic enzymes should discontinue Fosinopril Sodium and Hydrochlorothiazide tablets and receive appropriate medical follow-up. </p>
<p>Fosinopril Sodium and Hydrochlorothiazide should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377604" conceptname="Hepatic coma">hepatic coma</span>. Also, since the metabolism of fosinopril to fosinoprilat is normally dependent upon hepatic esterases, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4326594" conceptname="Abnormal liver function">impaired liver function</span> could develop elevated plasma levels of fosinopril. In a study of patients with alcoholic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192675" conceptname="Biliary cirrhosis">biliary cirrhosis</span> the rate (but not the extent) of hydrolysis to fosinoprilat was reduced. In these patients the clearance of fosinoprilat was reduced, and the area under the fosinoprilat-time curve was approximately doubled.</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Derangements of Serum Electrolytes:</span> In clinical trials of fosinopril monotherapy, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span> (serum potassium at least 10% greater than the upper limit of normal) occurred in approximately 2.6% of hypertensive patients receiving fosinopril. In most cases, these were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. Risk factors for the development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span> included <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassiumsparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and/or potassiumcontaining salt substitutes.</p>
<p>Conversely, treatment with thiazide diuretics has been associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">hyponatremia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4289304" conceptname="Hypochloremic alkalosis">hypochloremic alkalosis</span>. These disturbances have sometimes been manifest as one or more of dryness of mouth, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4241197" conceptname="Thirst">thirst</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">weakness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4061577" conceptname="Lethargy">lethargy</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">restlessness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442752" conceptname="Muscle pain">muscle pains</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75635" conceptname="Cramp">cramps</span>, muscular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306451" conceptname="Oliguria">oliguria</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">Hypokalemia</span> can also sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis. The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span> is greatest in patients with cirrhosis of the liver, in patients experiencing a brisk <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span>, in patients who are receiving inadequate oral intake of electrolytes, and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with corticosteroids or ACTH.</p>
<p>The opposite effects of fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide on serum potassium will approximately balance each other in many patients, so that no net effect upon serum potassium will be seen. In other patients, one or the other effect may be dominant. Initial and periodic determinations of serum electrolytes to detect possible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022093" conceptname="Electrolyte imbalance">electrolyte imbalance</span> should be performed at appropriate intervals.</p>
<p>Chloride deficits are generally mild and require specific treatment only under extraordinary circumstances (e.g., in liver disease or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>). Dilutional <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">hyponatremia</span> may occur in edematous patients; appropriate therapy is water restriction rather than administration of salt, except in rare instances when the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">hyponatremia</span> is life-threatening. In actual <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">salt depletion</span>, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.</p>
<p>Calcium excretion is decreased by thiazides. In a few patients on prolonged thiazide therapy, pathological changes in the parathyroid gland have been observed, with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435511" conceptname="Hypercalcemia">hypercalcemia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177973" conceptname="Hypophosphatemia">hypophosphatemia</span>.

<p>Thiazides increase the urinary excretion of magnesium and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4098604" conceptname="Hypomagnesemia">hypomagnesemia</span> may result.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Other Metabolic Disturbances:</span> Thiazide diuretics tend to reduce glucose tolerance and to raise serum levels of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>, triglycerides and uric acid.

<p><span class="Italics">Surgery/Anesthesia:</span> In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, fosinopril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: </span>As noted above (“Derangements of Serum Electrolytes?), the net effect of Fosinopril Sodium and Hydrochlorothiazide may be to elevate a patient’s serum potassium, to reduce it, or to leave it unchanged. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span>. If concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient’s serum potassium should be monitored frequently. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Lithium:</span> Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium toxicity</span> have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. Because renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium toxicity</span> is presumably raised further when, as in therapy with Fosinopril Sodium and Hydrochlorothiazide tablets, a thiazide diuretic is coadministered with the ACE inhibitor. Fosinopril</p>
<p>Sodium and Hydrochlorothiazide and lithium should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Antacids:</span> In a clinical pharmacology study, serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat were reduced when fosinopril was coadministered with an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril. If concomitant administration of these agents is indicated, dosing should be separated by 2 hours.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Other:</span> The bioavailability of unbound fosinoprilat is not altered by coadministration of fosinopril with <span class="Bold">aspirin, chlorthalidone, cimetidine, digoxin, metoclopramide, nifedipine, propranolol, propantheline, or warfarin</span>. Other ACE inhibitors have had less than additive effects with <span class="Bold">betaadrenergic blockers</span>, presumably because drugs of both classes lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the reninangiotensin system.</p>
<p>Interaction studies with <span class="Bold">warfarin </span>have failed to identify any clinically important effects of fosinopril on the serum concentration or clinical effects of the anticoagulant.</p>
<p>Insulin requirements in diabetic patients may be increased, decreased, or unchanged.</p>
<p>Thiazides may decrease arterial responsiveness to <span class="Bold">norepinephrine</span>, but not enough to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use.</p>
<p>Thiazides may increase the responsiveness to <span class="Bold">tubocurarine</span>. </p>
<p>The diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics may be reduced by concurrent administration of <span class="Bold">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents</span>; the effects (if any) of these agents on the antihypertensive effect of Fosinopril Sodium and Hydrochlorothiazide have not been studied.</p>
<p>By alkalinizing the urine, hydrochlorothiazide may decrease the effectiveness of <span class="Bold">methenamine</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins: </span>Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Fosinopril-Hydrochlorothiazide: </span>Reproductive studies and long-term carcinogenicity studies with Fosinopril Sodium and Hydrochlorothiazide have not been conducted. The combination of fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide was not mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test, the mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> forward mutation assay, or the Chinese hamster ovary cell cytogenetic assay. The combination was also not genotoxic in a mouse micronucleus test in vivo.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Fosinopril Sodium: </span>No evidence of a carcinogenicity was found when fosinopril was given in the diet to rats and mice for up to 24 months at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. On a body weight basis, the highest dose was about 250 times the maximum human dose of 80 mg, given to a 50 kg subject. On a body surface area basis, this dose is 20 (mice) to 40 (rats) times the maximum human dose. </p>
<p>Neither fosinopril nor the fosinoprilat moiety was mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test, the mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> forward mutation assay, or a mitotic gene conversion assay. Fosinopril was also not genotoxic in a mouse micronucleus test in vivo and a mouse bone marrow cytogenetic assay in vivo. </p>
<p>In Chinese hamster ovary cell cytogenetic assay, fosinopril increased the frequency of chromosomal aberrations when tested without metabolic activation at a concentration that was toxic to the cells. However, there was no increase in chromosomal aberrations at lower drug concentrations without metabolic activation or at any concentration with metabolic activation.</p>
<p>There were no adverse reproductive effects in male and female rats treated with up to 60 mg/kg daily. At doses 4 times higher, slight increases in pairing time were seen. This higher dose is about 125 (body surface area basis) or 600 (body-weight basis) times greater than the dose received by a 50-kg human receiving 20 mg a day.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Hydrochlorothiazide: </span>Under the auspices of the National Toxicology Program, rats and mice received hydrochlorothiazide for two years at doses up to 100 (rats) and 600 (mice) mg/kg/day. On a body weight basis, these highest doses were about 2400 times (mice) or 400 times (rats) the Fosinopril Sodium and Hydrochlorothiazide dose of 12.5 mg, given to a 50 kg subject. On a body surface area basis, these doses are 226 times (mice) and 82 times (rats) the Fosinopril Sodium and Hydrochlorothiazide dose. These studies uncovered no evidence of carcinogenicity in rats or female mice, but there was equivocal evidence of hepatocarcinogenicity in male mice. </p>
<p>Hydrochlorothiazide was not genotoxic in in vitro assays using <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, TA 1537, and TA 1538 of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span> typhimurium (Ames assay); in the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) test for chromosomal aberrations; or in in vivo assays using mouse germinal cell chromosomes; Chinese Hamster bone-marrow chromosomes, and the Drosophila sex-linked recessive lethal trait gene. Using concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide of 43-1300 mg/mL, positive test results were obtained in the in vitro CHO Sister Chromatid Exchange (clastogenicity) test and in the Mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">Lymphoma</span> Cell (mutagenicity) assays. Using an unspecified concentration of hydrochlorothiazide, positive test results were also obtained in the Aspergillus nidulans nondisjunction assay. </p>
<p>No adverse effects upon fertility were seen when rats and mice received dietary hydrochlorothiazide prior to mating and throughout gestation at doses up to 4 (rats) and 100 (mice) mg/kg/day. These doses are from 3.2 (body surface area basis in rats) to 400 (weight basis in mice) times greater than the dose received by a 50 kg human receiving 12.5 mg a day.</p>

<h2>Nursing mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Both fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue Fosinopril Sodium and Hydrochlorothiazide, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<h2>Geriatric use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of fosinopril sodium-hydrochlorothiazide did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Fosinopril sodium-hydrochlorothiazide tablets have been evaluated for safety in over 660 patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>; approximately 137 of these patients were treated for more than one year. The observed adverse events were generally mild, transient, and similar to those seen with fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide taken separately. There was no relationship between the incidence of side effects and age.</p>
<p>In placebo-controlled clinical trials of fosinopril sodiumhydrochlorothiazide, the usual duration of therapy was two months. Adverse clinical or laboratory events led to discontinuation of therapy by 4.3% of 368 placebo-treated patients and by 3.5% of 660 fosinopril sodiumhydrochlorothiazide-treated patients.</p>
<p>The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with fosinopril sodium-hydrochlorothiazide in U.S. studies were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> (0.3%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> (0.3%; see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>), and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span> (0.2%).</p>
<p>The side effects considered probably or possibly related to study drug that occurred in placebo-controlled trials in more than 2% of patients treated with fosinopril sodiumhydrochlorothiazide are shown in the table below.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, a good resource is a certified Regional Poison Control Center. Telephone numbers of certified poison control centers are listed in the <span class="Italics">Physicians’ Desk Reference </span>(PDR). In managing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, consider the possibilities of multiple-drug <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span>, drug-drug interactions, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient.</p>
<p>No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with Fosinopril Sodium and Hydrochlorothiazide tablets; treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Therapy with Fosinopril Sodium and Hydrochlorothiazide should be discontinued, and the patient should be observed. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435796" conceptname="Dehydration">Dehydration</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022093" conceptname="Electrolyte imbalance">electrolyte imbalance</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> should be treated by established procedures. </p>
<p>In rats, single oral doses of 2600 mg/kg of fosinopril were associated with significant lethality. In single-dose studies of hydrochlorothiazide, most rats survived doses of up to 2750 mg/kg. Both doses are more than 6000 times (on a mg/kg basis) the maximum recommended daily dose of either fosinopril or hydrochlorothiazide in Fosinopril Sodium and Hydrochlorothiazide.</p>
<p>Data from human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> of fosinopril are scanty, but the most common manifestation of human fosinopril overdosage is likely to be <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>. In human hydrochlorothiazide <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, the most common signs and symptoms observed have been those of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435796" conceptname="Dehydration">dehydration</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4077438" conceptname="Electrolyte depletion">electrolyte depletion</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4016089" conceptname="Hypochloremia">hypochloremia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">hyponatremia</span>). If digitalis has also been administered, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span> may accentuate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmias</span>.</p>
<p>Laboratory determinations of serum levels of fosinopril and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of fosinopril <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of fosinopril and its metabolites. Fosinoprilat is poorly removed from the body by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. </p>
<p>Angiotensin II could presumably serve as a specific antagonist-antidote in the setting of fosinopril <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, but angiotensin II is essentially unavailable outside of scattered research facilities. Because the hypotensive effect of fosinopril is achieved through vasodilation and effective <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436375" conceptname="Hypovolemia">hypovolemia</span>, it is reasonable to treat fosinopril <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> by infusion of normal saline solution.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Fosinopril is an effective treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> in once-daily doses of 10-80 mg, while hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5-50 mg per day. In clinical trials of fosinopril/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using fosinopril doses of 2.5-40 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses at 5-37.5 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing dose of either component.</p>
<p>The hazards (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>) of fosinopril are generally rare and apparently independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>) and dose-independent phenomena (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192640" conceptname="Pancreatitis">pancreatitis</span>), the former much more common than the latter. Therapy with any combination of fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide will be associated with both sets of dose-independent hazards. To minimize doseindependent hazards, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Dose Titration by Clinical Effect</span></p>
<p>A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with fosinopril or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy may be switched to combination therapy with Fosinopril Sodium and Hydrochlorothiazide. Dosage must be guided by clinical response; controlled clinical trials showed that the addition of 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide to 10-20 mg of fosinopril will typically be associated with additional reduction in seated diastolic blood pressure at 24 hours after dosing. On average, the effect of the combination of 10 mg of fosinopril with 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide was similar to the effect seen with monotherapy using either 40 mg of fosinopril or 37.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Use in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal Impairment</span></span></p>
<p>In patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (creatinine clearance is &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m<span class="Sup">2</span>, serum creatine roughly ≥ 3 mg/dL or 265 μmol/L), loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides, so Fosinopril Sodium and Hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended. In patients with lesser degrees of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>. Fosinopril Sodium and Hydrochlorothiazide may be used with no change in dosage.</p>
