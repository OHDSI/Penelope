<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">The active ingredient in DIPENTUM Capsules (olsalazine sodium) is the sodium salt of a salicylate, disodium 3,3'-azobis (6-hydroxybenzoate) a compound that is effectively bioconverted to 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), which has anti-inflammatory activity in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="81893" conceptname="Ulcerative colitis">ulcerative colitis</span>. Its empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">14</span>H<span class="Sub">8</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>Na<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">6</span> with a molecular weight of 346.21.</p>
<p>The structural formula is:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="Image from Drug Label Content" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=75a96561-6f52-4c11-a105-391fbbfe4827&amp;name=dipentum_struct.jpg"></div>
<p>Olsalazine sodium is a yellow crystalline powder, which melts with decomposition at 240°C. It is the sodium salt of a weak acid, soluble in water and DMSO, and practically insoluble in ethanol, chloroform, and ether. Olsalazine sodium has acceptable stability under acidic or basic conditions.</p>
<p>DIPENTUM is supplied in hard gelatin capsules for oral administration. The inert ingredient in each 250 mg capsule of olsalazine sodium is magnesium stearate. The capsule shell contains the following inactive ingredients: black iron oxide, caramel, gelatin, and titanium dioxide. </p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">After oral administration, olsalazine has limited systemic bioavailability. Based on oral and intravenous dosing studies, approximately 2.4% of a single 1.0 g oral dose is absorbed. Less than 1% of olsalazine is recovered in the urine. The remaining 98 to 99% of an oral dose will reach the colon, where each molecule is rapidly converted into two molecules of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) by colonic bacteria and the low prevailing redox potential found in this environment. The liberated 5-ASA is absorbed slowly resulting in very high local concentrations in the colon.</p>
<p>The conversion of olsalazine to mesalamine (5-ASA) in the colon is similar to that of sulfasalazine, which is converted into sulfapyridine and mesalamine. It is thought that the mesalamine component is therapeutically active in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="81893" conceptname="Ulcerative colitis">ulcerative colitis</span> (A.K. Azad-Kahn et al, <span class="Italics">LANCET</span>, 2: 892-895, 1977). The usual dose of sulfasalazine for maintenance of remission in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="81893" conceptname="Ulcerative colitis">ulcerative colitis</span> is 2 grams daily, which would provide approximately 0.8 grams of mesalamine to the colon. More than 0.9 grams of mesalamine would usually be made available in the colon from 1 gram of olsalazine.</p>
<p>The mechanism of action of mesalamine (and sulfasalazine) is unknown, but appears to be topical rather than systemic. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways (i.e., prostanoids) and through the lipoxygenase pathways (i.e., leukotrienes [LTs] and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids [HETEs]) is increased in patients with chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4074815" conceptname="Inflammatory bowel disease">inflammatory bowel disease</span>, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin (PG) production in the colon. </p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of olsalazine are similar in both healthy volunteers and in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="81893" conceptname="Ulcerative colitis">ulcerative colitis</span>. Maximum serum concentrations of olsalazine appear after approximately 1 hour and, even after a 1.0 g single dose, are low (e.g., 1.6 to 6.2 µmol/L). Olsalazine has a very short serum half-life, approximately 0.9 hours. Olsalazine is more than 99% bound to plasma proteins. It does not interfere with protein binding of warfarin.The urinary recovery of olsalazine is below 1%. Total recovery of oral <span class="Sup">14</span>C-labeled olsalazine in animals and humans ranges from 90 to 97%. Approximately 0.1% of an oral dose of olsalazine is metabolized in the liver to olsalazine-O-sulfate (olsalazine-S). Olsalazine-S, in contrast to olsalazine has a half-life of 7 days. Olsalazine-S accumulates to steady state within 2 to 3 weeks. </p>
<p>Patients on daily doses of 1.0 g olsalazine for 2 to 4 years show a stable plasma concentration of olsalazine-S (3.3 to 12.4 µmol/L). Olsalazine-S is more than 99% bound to plasma proteins. Its long half-life is mainly due to slow dissociation from the protein binding site. Less than 1% of both olsalazine and olsalazine-S appears undissociated in plasma. </p>

<a name="s3.2.1"></a><a name="section-3.1.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) </h3>
<p class="First">Serum concentrations of 5-ASA are detected after 4 to 8 hours. The peak levels of 5-ASA after an oral dose of 1.0 g olsalazine are low (i.e., 0 to 4.3 µmol/L). Of the total 5-ASA found in the urine, more than 90% is in the form of N-acetyl-5-ASA (Ac-5-ASA). Only small amounts of 5-ASA are detected.  </p>
<p>N-acetyl-5-ASA (Ac-5-ASA), the major metabolite of 5-ASA found in plasma and urine, is acetylated (deactivated) in at least two sites, the colonic epithelium and the liver. Ac-5-ASA is found in the serum, with peak values of 1.7 to 8.7 µmol/L after a single 1.0 g dose. Approximately 20% of the total 5-ASA is recovered in the urine, where it is found almost exclusively as Ac-5-ASA. The remaining 5-ASA is partially acetylated and is excreted in the feces. From fecal dialysis, the concentration of 5-ASA in the colon following olsalazine has been calculated to be 18 to 49 mmol/L. No accumulation of 5-ASA or Ac-5-ASA in plasma has been detected. 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA are 74 and 81%, respectively, bound to plasma proteins.  </p>

<h1>ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Preclinical subacute and chronic toxicity studies in rats have shown the kidney to be the major target organ of olsalazine toxicity. At an oral daily dose of 400 mg/kg or higher, olsalazine treatment produced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="193253" conceptname="Nephritis">nephritis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="444044" conceptname="Acute tubular necrosis">tubular necrosis</span> in a 4-week study; interstitial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="193253" conceptname="Nephritis">nephritis</span> and tubular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280820" conceptname="Calcinosis">calcinosis</span> in a 6-month study, and renal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012171" conceptname="Fibrosis">fibrosis</span>, mineralization, and transitional cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4296894" conceptname="Hyperplasia">hyperplasia</span> in a 1-year study. </p>

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First">Two controlled studies have demonstrated the efficacy of olsalazine as maintenance therapy in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="81893" conceptname="Ulcerative colitis">ulcerative colitis</span>. In the first, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="81893" conceptname="Ulcerative colitis">ulcerative colitis</span> patients in remission were randomized to olsalazine 500 mg B.I.D. or placebo, and relapse rates for a six month period of time were compared. For the 52 patients randomized to olsalazine, 12 relapses occurred, while for the 49 placebo patients, 22 relapses occurred. This difference in relapse rates was significant (p&lt;0.02). </p>
<p>In the second study, 164 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="81893" conceptname="Ulcerative colitis">ulcerative colitis</span> patients in remission were randomized to olsalazine 500 mg B.I.D. or sulfasalazine 1 gram B.I.D., and relapse rates were compared after six months. The relapse rate for olsalazine was 19.5% while that for sulfasalazine was 12.2%, a non-significant difference. </p>

<h2>Drug Interactions </h2>
<p class="First">The co-administration of salicylates and low molecular weight heparins or heparinoids may result in an increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> (i.e., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4147001" conceptname="Hematoma">hematomas</span>) following neuraxial anesthesia.  Salicylates should be discontinued prior to the initiation of a low molecular weight heparin or heparinoid.  If this is not possible, it is recommended to monitor patients closely for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>.</p>
<p>Increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time in patients taking concomitant warfarin has been reported.</p>
<p>The co-administration of olsalazine and 6-mercaptopurine or thioguanine may result in an increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4145241" conceptname="Bone marrow depression">myelosuppression</span>.

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility </h2>
<p class="First">In a two year oral rat carcinogenicity study, olsalazine was tested in male and female Wistar rats at daily doses of  200, 400, and 800 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 to 40 times the human maintenance dose, based on a patient weight of 50 kg and a human dose of 1 g). Urinary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113111" conceptname="Transitional cell carcinoma of bladder">bladder transitional cell carcinomas</span> were found in three male rats (6%, p=0.022, exact trend test) receiving 40 times the human dose and were not found in untreated male controls. In the same study, urinary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113111" conceptname="Transitional cell carcinoma of bladder">bladder transitional cell carcinoma</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4034142" conceptname="Papilloma">papilloma</span> occurred in 2 untreated control female rats (2%). No such tumors were found in any of the female rats treated at doses up to 40 times the human dose. </p>
<p>In an eighteen month oral mouse carcinogenicity study, olsalazine was tested in male and female CD-1 mice at daily doses of 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg/day (approximately 25 to 100 times the human maintenance dose). Liver hemangiosarcomata were found in two male mice (4%) receiving olsalazine at 100 times the human dose, while no such tumor occurred in the other treated male mice groups or any of the treated female mice. The observed incidence of this tumor is within the 4% incidence in historical controls.  </p>
<p>Olsalazine was not mutagenic in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> Ames tests, mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> cell mutation assays, human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration tests, or the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> rat bone marrow cell chromosomal aberration test.  </p>
<p>Olsalazine in a dose range of 100 to 400 mg/kg/day (approximately 5 to 20 times the human maintenance dose) did not influence the fertility of male or female rats. The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4339289" conceptname="Oligozoospermia">oligospermia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4035976" conceptname="Sterility">infertility</span> in men associated with sulfasalazine have not been reported with olsalazine. </p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of DIPENTUM did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, elderly patients should be treated with caution due to the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, co-existence of other disease, as well as concomitant drug therapy.  </p>

<p>Over 2,500 patients have been treated with olsalazine in various controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies. In these as well as in post-marketing experience, olsalazine was administered mainly to patients intolerant to sulfasalazine. There have been rare reports of the following adverse effects in patients receiving olsalazine. These were often difficult to distinguish from possible symptoms of the underlying disease or from the effects of prior and/or concomitant therapy. A causal relationship to the drug has not been demonstrated for some of these reactions.  </p>
