<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Fenoprofen calcium is a nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory, antiarthritic drug that also possesses analgesic and antipyretic activities. Its exact mode of action is unknown, but it is thought that prostaglandin synthetase inhibition is involved.</p>
<p>Results in humans demonstrate that fenoprofen has both anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions. The emergence and degree of erythemic response were measured in adult male volunteers exposed to ultraviolet irradiation. The effects of Fenoprofen calcium, aspirin, and indomethacin were each compared with those of a placebo. All 3 drugs demonstrated antierythemic activity.</p>
<p>In all patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span>, the anti-inflammatory action of Fenoprofen calcium has been evidenced by relief of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, increase in grip strength, and reductions in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154927" conceptname="Joint swelling">joint swelling</span>, duration of morning <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4060220" conceptname="Stiff neck">stiffness</span>, and disease activity (as assessed by both the investigator and the patient). The anti-inflammatory action of Fenoprofen calcium has also been evidenced by increased mobility (i.e., a decrease in the number of joints having limited motion).</p>
<p>The use of Fenoprofen calcium in combination with gold salts or corticosteroids has been studied in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span>. The studies, however, were inadequate in demonstrating whether further improvement is obtained by adding Fenoprofen calcium to maintenance therapy with gold salts or steroids. Whether or not Fenoprofen calcium used in conjunction with partially effective doses of a corticosteroid has a â€œsteroid-sparingâ€? effect is unknown.</p>
<p>In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80180" conceptname="Osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</span>, the anti-inflammatory and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effects</span> of Fenoprofen calcium have been demonstrated by reduction in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4082445" conceptname="Tenderness">tenderness</span> as a response to pressure and reductions in night <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4060220" conceptname="Stiff neck">stiffness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span>, and overall disease activity (as assessed by both the patient and the investigator). These effects have also been demonstrated by relief of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> with motion and at rest and increased range of motion in involved joints.</p>
<p>In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80180" conceptname="Osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</span>, clinical studies have shown Fenoprofen calcium to be comparable to aspirin in controlling the aforementioned measures of disease activity, but mild gastrointestinal reactions (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="23325" conceptname="Heartburn">dyspepsia</span>) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377575" conceptname="Tinnitus">tinnitus</span> occurred less frequently in patients treated with Fenoprofen calcium than in aspirin-treated patients. It is not known whether Fenoprofen calcium causes less <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4027663" conceptname="Peptic ulcer">peptic ulceration</span> than does aspirin.</p>
<p>In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, the analgesic action of Fenoprofen calcium has produced a reduction in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> intensity, an increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relief, improvement in total <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> scores, and a sustained <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span>.</p>
<p>Under fasting conditions, Fenoprofen calcium is rapidly absorbed, and peak plasma levels of 50 Î¼g/mL are achieved within 2 hours after oral administration of 600 mg doses. Good dose proportionality was observed between 200 mg and 600 mg doses in fasting male volunteers. The plasma half-life is approximately 3 hours. About 90% of a single oral dose is eliminated within 24 hours as fenoprofen glucuronide and 4'-hydroxyfenoprofen glucuronide, the major urinary metabolites of fenoprofen. Fenoprofen is highly bound (99%) to albumin.</p>
<p>The concomitant administration of antacid (containing both aluminum and magnesium hydroxide) does not interfere with absorption of Fenoprofen calcium.</p>
<p>There is less suppression of collagen-induced platelet aggregation with single doses of Fenoprofen calcium than there is with aspirin.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</span></span><br>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may give a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</p>
<p>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI events (see WARNINGS - <span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal Effects</span>).</p>
<p>Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> in the first 10-14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> (see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>).</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">Hypertension</span></span></span><br>NSAIDs, including Fenoprofen calcium, can lead to onset of new <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> or worsening of pre-existing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including Fenoprofen calcium, should be used with caution in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>. Blood pressure should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.</p>

The possibility of renal involvement should be considered.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal Effects â€“ Risk of Ulceration, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">Bleeding</span>, and Perforation</span><br>NSAIDs, including Fenoprofen calcium, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcers</span>, gross <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2-4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk.</p>
<p>NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcer</span> disease or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">gastrointestinal bleeding</span>.

Other factors that increase the risk for GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.<br>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Renal Effects</span><br>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4152839" conceptname="Acute papillary necrosis">renal papillary necrosis</span> and other <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4220631" conceptname="Injury of kidney">renal injury</span>. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decomposition. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly.

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">General</span><br>Fenoprofen calcium cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids.</p>
<p>The pharmacological activity of Fenoprofen calcium in reducing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Hepatic Effects</span><br>Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including Fenoprofen calcium. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with continuing therapy. Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately three or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span> and fatal fulminant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4337543" conceptname="Hepatic necrosis">liver necrosis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic failure</span>, some of them with fatal outcomes, have been reported.</p>
<p>A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with Fenoprofen calcium.

<p>5. Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4061577" conceptname="Lethargy">lethargy</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span>, right upper quadrant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4082445" conceptname="Tenderness">tenderness</span>, and "flu-like" symptoms).

If these occur, patients should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).<br>7. Starting at 30-weeks gestation, Fenoprofen calcium and other NSAIDs should be avoided by pregnant women as premature closure of the ductus arteriosus in the fetus may occur.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Laboratory Tests</span><br>Because serious GI tract ulcerations and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs should have their CBC and a chemistry profile checked periodically. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span> develop, systemic manifestations occur (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302954" conceptname="Disorder characterized by eosinophilia">eosinophilia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>, etc.) or abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, Fenoprofen calcium should be discontinued.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">ACE-inhibitors</span></span><br>Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Aspirin</span></span><br>The coadministration of aspirin decreases the biologic half-life of fenoprofen because of an increase in metabolic clearance that results in a greater amount of hydroxylated fenoprofen in the urine. Although the mechanism of interaction between fenoprofen and aspirin is not totally known, enzyme induction and displacement of fenoprofen from plasma albumin binding sites are possibilities. As with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of fenoprofen calcium and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Diuretics</span></span><br>Clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations, have shown that Fenoprofen calcium can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> (see WARNINGS - Renal Effects), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Lithium</span></span><br>NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium toxicity</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Methotrexate</span></span><br>NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Warfarin</span></span><br>The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> higher than users of either drug alone.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Phenobarbital</span></span><br>Chronic administration of phenobarbital, a known enzyme inducer, may be associated with a decrease in the plasma half-life of fenoprofen. When phenobarbital is added to or withdrawn from treatment, dosage adjustment of Fenoprofen calcium may be required.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Plasma Protein Binding</span></span><br>In vitro studies have shown that fenoprofen, because of its affinity for albumin, may displace from their binding sites other drugs that are also albumin bound, and this may lead to drug interactions. Theoretically, fenoprofen could likewise be displaced. Patients receiving hydantoins, sulfonamides, or sulfonylureas should be observed for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">increased activity</span> of these drugs and, therefore, signs of toxicity from these drugs.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions</span></span><br>Amerlex-M kit assay values of total and free triiodothyronine in patients receiving Fenoprofen calcium have been reported as falsely elevated on the basis of a chemical cross-reaction that directly interferes with the assay. Thyroid-stimulating hormone, total thyroxine, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone response are not affected.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility</span></span><br>Long-term studies in animals have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of fenoprofen. Studies have not been conducted to determine the effect of fenoprofen on mutagenicity or fertility.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy</span></p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category C Prior to 30-Weeks Gestation; Category D starting at 30-Weeks Gestation.</span></span></p>
<p>Starting at 30-weeks gestation, Fenoprofen calcium and other NSAIDs should be avoided by pregnant women as premature closure of the ductus arteriosus in the fetus may occur. Fenoprofen calcium can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman starting at 30-weeks gestation. If this drug is used during this time period in pregnancy, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Prior to 30-weeks gestation, Fenoprofen calcium should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<p>Reproductive studies conducted in rats and rabbits have not demonstrated evidence of developmental abnormalities when given daily oral doses of 50 or 100 mg/kg fenoprofen calcium, respectively (0.15 and 0.6 times the maximum human daily dose of 3200 mg based on body surface area comparisons). However, animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Nonteratogenic Effects</span></span><br>Because of the known effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of ductus arteriosus), use during pregnancy (particularly late pregnancy) should be avoided.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Labor and Delivery</span><br>The effects of Fenoprofen calcium on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown. In rat studies, maternal exposure to NSAIDs, as with other drugs known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, increased the incidence of dystocia, delayed parturition, and decreased pup survival.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers</span><br>It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Fenoprofen calcium, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use</span><br>Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under the age of 18 have not been established.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Geriatric Use</span><br>As with any NSAIDs, caution should be exercised in treating the elderly (65 years and older).</p>

<p><span class="Italics">Treatment</span>â€”To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, a good resource is your certified Regional Poison Control Center. Telephone numbers of certified poison control centers are listed in the Physiciansâ€™ Desk Reference (PDR). In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">multiple drug overdoses</span>, interaction among drugs, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient.</p>
<p>Protect the patientâ€™s airway and support ventilation and perfusion. Meticulously monitor and maintain, within acceptable limits, the patientâ€™s vital signs, blood gases, serum electrolytes, etc. Absorption of drugs from the gastrointestinal tract may be decreased by giving activated charcoal, which, in many cases, is more effective than lavage; consider charcoal instead of or in addition to gastric emptying. Repeated doses of charcoal over time may hasten elimination of some drugs that have been absorbed. Safeguard the patientâ€™s airway when employing gastric emptying or charcoal.</p>
<p>Alkalinization of the urine, forced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span>, peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, and charcoal hemoperfusion do not enhance systemic drug elimination.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of Fenoprofen calcium and other treatment options before deciding to use Fenoprofen calcium. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p>
<p>After observing the response to initial therapy with Fenoprofen calcium, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">Analgesia</span></span><br>For the treatment of mild to moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, the recommended dosage is 200 mg given orally every 4 to 6 hours, as needed.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">Rheumatoid Arthritis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80180" conceptname="Osteoarthritis">Osteoarthritis</span></span><br>For the relief of signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80180" conceptname="Osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</span> the recommended dose is 400 to 600 mg given orally, 3 or 4 times a day. The dose should be tailored to the needs of the patient and may be increased or decreased depending on the severity of the symptoms. Dosage adjustments may be made after initiation of drug therapy or during exacerbations of the disease. Total daily dosage should not exceed 3,200 mg.</p>
<p>Fenoprofen calcium may be administered with meals or with milk. Although the total amount absorbed is not affected, peak blood levels are delayed and diminished.</p>
<p>Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> generally seem to require larger doses of Fenoprofen calcium than do those with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80180" conceptname="Osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</span>. The smallest dose that yields acceptable control should be employed.</p>
<p>Although improvement may be seen in a few days in many patients, an additional 2 to 3 weeks may be required to gauge the full benefits of therapy.</p>
