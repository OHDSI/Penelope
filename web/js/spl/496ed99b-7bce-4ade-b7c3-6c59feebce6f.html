<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Hydrocodone is a semisynthetic narcotic analgesic and antitussive with multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of codeine. Most of these involve the central nervous system and smooth muscle.  The precise mechanism of action of hydrocodone and other opiates is not known, although it is believed to relate to the existence of opiate receptors in the central nervous system. In addition to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, narcotics may produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, changes in mood and mental clouding.</p>
<p>The analgesic action of acetaminophen involves peripheral influences, but the specific mechanism is as yet undetermined. Antipyretic activity is mediated through hypothalamic heat regulating centers.  Acetaminophen inhibits prostaglandin synthetase.  Therapeutic doses of acetaminophen have negligible effects on the cardiovascular or respiratory systems; however, toxic doses may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443240" conceptname="Collapse">circulatory failure</span> and rapid, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302536" conceptname="Shallow breathing">shallow breathing</span>.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">The behavior of the individual components is described below.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="i4i_section_id_2a258bc4-25f1-45bb-bfb8-4922e1055ac3"></a><a name="section-2.1.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Hydrocodone</h3>
<p class="First">Following a 10mg oral dose of hydrocodone administered to five adult male subjects, the mean peak concentration was 23.6 Â±5.2ng/mL. Maximum serum levels were achieved at 1.3 Â± 0.3 hours and the half-life was determined to be 3.8 Â± 0.3 hours. Hydrocodone exhibits a complex pattern of metabolism including 0-demethylation, N-demethylation and 6-keto reduction to the corresponding 6-Î±- and 6â€“Î²- hydroxy- metabolites.</p>
<p>See OVERDOSAGE for toxicity information.</p>

<h3>Acetaminophen</h3>
<p class="First">Acetaminophen is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is distributed throughout most body tissues. The plasma half-life is 1.25 to 3 hours, but may be increased by liver</p>
<p>damage and following overdosage. Elimination of acetaminophen is principally by liver metabolism (conjugation) and subsequent renal excretion of metabolites. Approximately 85% of an oral dose appears in the urine within 24 hours of administration, most as the glucuronide conjugate, with small amounts of other conjugates and unchanged drug.  See OVERDOSAGE for toxicity information.</p>

<h2>Misuse Abuse and Diversion of Opioids</h2>
<p class="First">VICODIN HP contains hydrocodone, an opioid agonist, and is a Schedule III controlled substance.  Opioid agonists have the potential for being abused and are sought by abusers and people with addiction disorders, and are subject to diversion.   </p>
<p>VICODIN HP can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing VICODIN HP in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse or diversion (see DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span>).</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Acetaminophen is excreted in breast milk in small amounts, but the significance of its effects on nursing infants is not known. It is not known whether hydrocodone is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from hydrocodone and acetaminophen, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of VICODIN HP<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen 10 mg/660 mg) did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.  Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>
<p>Hydrocodone and the major metabolites of acetaminophen are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney. Thus the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> due to accumulation of the parent compound and/or metabolites in the plasma. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p>
<p>Hydrocodone may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> and over-sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets and observed closely.</p>

<h2>Misuse Abuse and Diversion of Opioids</h2>
<p class="First">VICODIN HP contains hydrocodone, an opioid agonist, and is a Schedule III controlled substance.  VICODIN HP, and other opioids, used in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> can be abused and are subject to criminal diversion.</p>
<p>Addiction is a primary, chronic, neurobiologic disease, with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations.  It is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following: impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug addiction</span> is a treatable disease utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common.  â€œDrug seekingâ€? behavior is very common in addicts and drug abusers. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated â€œlossâ€? of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). â€œDoctor shoppingâ€? to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction.</p>
<p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> and tolerance. Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> usually assumes clinically significant dimensions only after several weeks of continued opioid use, although a mild degree of physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> may develop after a few days of opioid therapy.</p>
<p>Tolerance, in which increasingly large doses are required in order to produce the same degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, is manifested initially by a shortened duration of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span>, and subsequently by decreases in the intensity of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>. The rate of development of tolerance varies among patients.  Physicians should be aware that abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction and is characterized by misuse for non-medical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances.  VICODIN HP, like other opioids, may be diverted for non-medical use. Record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised.</p>
<p>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</p>

<p>Early symptoms following a potentially hepatotoxic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> may include: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">diaphoresis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4272240" conceptname="Malaise">general malaise</span>.

<h2>Treatment</h2>
<p class="First">A single or multiple <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> with hydrocodone and acetaminophen is a potentially lethal polydrug <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, and consultation with a regional poison control center is recommended.</p>
<p>Immediate treatment includes support of cardiorespiratory function and measures to reduce drug absorption. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">Vomiting</span> should be induced mechanically, or with syrup of ipecac, if the patient is alert (adequate pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes). Oral activated charcoal (1 g/kg) should follow gastric emptying. The first dose should be accompanied by an appropriate cathartic. If repeated doses are used, the cathartic might be included with alternate doses as required. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> is usually hypovolemic and should respond to fluids. Vasopressors and other supportive measures should be employed as indicated.  A cuffed endo-tracheal tube should be inserted before gastric lavage of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372448" conceptname="Loss of consciousness">unconscious</span> patient and, when necessary, to provide assisted respiration.</p>
<p>Meticulous attention should be given to maintaining adequate pulmonary ventilation. In severe cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>, peritoneal dialysis, or preferably hemodialysis may be considered. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4253058" conceptname="Factor II deficiency">hypoprothrombinemia</span> occurs due to acetaminophen <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, vitamin K should be administered intravenously.</p>
<p>Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, can reverse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span> associated with opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. Naloxone hydrochloride 0.4 mg to 2 mg is given parenterally. Since the duration of action of hydrocodone may exceed that of the naloxone, the patient should be kept under continuous surveillance and repeated doses of the antagonist should be administered as needed to maintain adequate respiration. An opioid antagonist should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or cardiovascular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.</p>
<p>If the dose of acetaminophen may have exceeded 140 mg/kg, acetylcysteine should be administered as early as possible. Serum acetaminophen levels should be obtained, since levels four or more hours following ingestion help predict acetaminophen toxicity.  Do not await acetaminophen assay results before initiating treatment. Hepatic enzymes should be obtained initially, and repeated at 24-hour intervals.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">Methemoglobinemia</span> over 30% should be treated with methylene blue by slow intravenous administration.</p>
<p>The toxic dose for adults for acetaminophen is 10 g.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Dosage should be adjusted according to the severity of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> and the response of the patient.
