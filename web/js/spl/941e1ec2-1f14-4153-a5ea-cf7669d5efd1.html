<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Each tablet of Equagesic, for oral administration, contains 200 mg meprobamate and 325 mg aspirin. Chemically, meprobamate is 2-methyl-2-propyl-1,3- propanediol dicarbamate. Its molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">9</span>H<span class="Sub">18</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">4</span> with a molecular weight of 218.25.</p>
<p>Chemically, aspirin is benzoic acid 2-(acetyloxy)-. Its molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">9</span>H<span class="Sub">8</span>O<span class="Sub">4</span> with a molecular weight of 180.16. It occurs as an odorless white, needle like crystalline or powdery substance. When exposed to moisture, aspirin hydrolyzes into salicylic and acetic acids, and gives off a vinegary odor. It is highly lipid soluble and slightly soluble in water. The structural formulas of meprobamate and aspirin are:</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Meprobamate is a carbamate derivative which has been shown (in animal and/or human studies) to have effects at multiple sites in the central nervous system, including the thalamus and limbic system. Aspirin is a nonnarcotic analgesic with antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties. </p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">As an adjunct in the short-term treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> accompanied by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4200706" conceptname="Tension">tension</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> in patients with musculoskeletal disease. Clinical trials have demonstrated that in these situations relief of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> is somewhat greater than with aspirin alone.Â  Equagesic is not intended for use longer than 10 days.</p>

<h1>Contraindications</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Usage in Pregnancy and Lactation</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">An increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of minor tranquilizers (meprobamate, chlordiazepoxide, and diazepam) during the first trimester of pregnancy has been suggested in several studies. Because use of these drugs is rarely a matter of urgency, their use during this period should almost always be avoided. </span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Because of the known effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of the ductus arteriosus), use during the third trimester of pregnancy should be avoided. Salicylate products have also been associated with alterations in maternal and neonatal hemostasis mechanisms, decreased birth weight, and perinatal mortality. The possibility that a woman of childbearing potential may be pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. Patients should be advised that if they become pregnant during therapy or intend to become pregnant they should communicate with their physicians about the desirability of discontinuing the drug. Meprobamate passes the placental barrier. It is present both in umbilical-cord blood at or near maternal plasma levels and in breast milk of lactating mothers at concentrations two to four times that of maternal plasma. When use of meprobamate is contemplated in breast-feeding patients, the drugâ€™s higher concentrations in breast milk as compared to maternal plasma levels should be considered.</span></p>
<p>Equagesic is contraindicated in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4120604" conceptname="Acute intermittent porphyria">acute intermittent porphyria</span> and in patients with allergic or idiosyncratic reactions to aspirin, meprobamate, or related compounds, such as carbromal, carisoprodol, mebutamate, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug products, salicylates, or tybamate. Equagesic is also contraindicated in patients with the syndrome of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4320791" conceptname="Rhinitis">rhinitis</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="253788" conceptname="Nasal polyp">nasal polyps</span>.

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First">Equagesic should be prescribed cautiously and in small quantities to patients with suicidal tendencies. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Additive Effects: </span>Since CNS-suppressant effects of meprobamate and alcohol or meprobamate and other psychotropic drugs may be additive, appropriate caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these agents simultaneously.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Alcohol Warning: </span>Patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks every day should be counseled about the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> risks involved with chronic, heavy alcohol use while taking aspirin.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Coagulation Abnormalities: </span>Even low doses of aspirin can inhibit platelet function leading to an increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4219104" conceptname="Bleeding time">bleeding time</span>. This can adversely affect patients with inherited (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4236898" conceptname="Hemophilia">hemophilia</span>) or acquired (liver disease or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435781" conceptname="Vitamin K deficiency">vitamin K deficiency</span>) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> disorders.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal Side Effects (GI)</span>: GI side effects include gross GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="23325" conceptname="Heartburn">heartburn</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194175" conceptname="Left upper quadrant pain">stomach pain</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>. Although minor upper GI symptoms, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="23325" conceptname="Heartburn">dyspepsia</span>, are common and can occur anytime during therapy, physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, even in the absence of previous GI symptoms. Physicians should inform patients about the signs and symptoms of GI side effects and what steps to take if they occur. </p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4027663" conceptname="Peptic ulcer">Peptic Ulcer Disease</span>: </span>Patients with a history of active <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4027663" conceptname="Peptic ulcer">peptic ulcer disease</span> should avoid using aspirin, which can cause gastric mucosal irritation and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Potentially Hazardous Tasks</span></p>
<p>Patients should be warned that meprobamate may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery. Such tasks should be avoided while taking this product.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Drug Interactions</span></span></h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors: </span>The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">hyponatremic</span> and hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to its indirect effect on the reninangiotensin conversion pathway. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Acetazolamide: </span>Concurrent use of aspirin and acetazolamide can lead to high serum concentrations of acetazolamide (and toxicity) due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Alcohol, General Anesthetics, Narcotic Analgesics, Sedative Hypnotics, Tranquilizers such as Chlordiazepoxide, or Other CNS Depressants: </span>The effects of these substances may be enhanced, causing increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Anticoagulant Therapy (Heparin and Warfarin): </span>Patients on anticoagulation therapy are at increased risk for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> because of drug-drug interactions and the effect on platelets. Aspirin can displace warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolongation of both the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time and the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4219104" conceptname="Bleeding time">bleeding time</span>.

<p><span class="Italics">Anticonvulsants: </span>Salicylates can displace protein-bound phenytoin and valproic acid, leading to a decrease in the total concentration of phenytoin and an increase in serum valproic acid levels. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Beta Blockers: </span>The hypotensive effects of beta blockers may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4125002" conceptname="Idiopathic fluid retention">fluid retention</span>.</p>

<p class="First">Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>, psychological <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>, and abuse have occurred. Chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> from prolonged ingestion of, usually, greater-than-recommended doses is manifested by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437584" conceptname="Ataxia">ataxia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196636" conceptname="Dysarthria">slurred speech</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439383" conceptname="Vertigo">vertigo</span>. Therefore, careful supervision of dose and amounts prescribed is advised, as well as avoidance of prolonged administration, especially for alcoholics and other patients with a known propensity for taking excessive quantities of drugs. Sudden withdrawal of the drug after prolonged and excessive use may precipitate recurrence of preexisting symptoms, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">anorexia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, or withdrawal reactions, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437584" conceptname="Ataxia">ataxia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusional states</span>, hallucinosis, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4247265" conceptname="Muscle twitch">muscle twitching</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremors</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, and, rarely, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsive seizures</span>.

Onset of withdrawal symptoms occurs usually within 12 to 48 hours after discontinuation of meprobamate; symptoms usually cease within the next 12- to 48-hour period. When excessive dosage has continued for weeks or months, dosage should be reduced gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks rather than abruptly stopped. Alternatively, a long-acting barbiturate may be substituted, then gradually withdrawn.</p>

<h1>Overdosage</h1>
<p class="First">Treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> with Equagesic is essentially symptomatic and supportive. In cases where excessive doses of Equagesic have been taken, sleep ensues rapidly and blood pressure, pulse, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4313591" conceptname="Respiratory rate">respiratory rates</span> are reduced to basal levels. Any drug remaining in the stomach should be removed and symptomatic treatment given. After <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> and/or lavage, activated charcoal may reduce absorption of both aspirin and meprobamate. Should respiration or blood pressure become compromised, respiratory assistance, central nervous system stimulants, and pressor agents should be administered cautiously as indicated. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">Diuresis</span>, osmotic (mannitol) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span>, peritoneal dialysis, and hemodialysis have been used successfully in removing both aspirin and meprobamate. Alkalinization of the urine increases the excretion of salicylates. Careful monitoring of urinary output is necessary, and caution should be taken to avoid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4266976" conceptname="Overhydration">overhydration</span>. Relapse and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>, after initial recovery, have been attributed to incomplete gastric emptying and delayed absorption. Salicylate toxicity may result from acute ingestion (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>) or chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>. Signs and symptoms include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal pain</span>, acid-base disturbances with development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373995" conceptname="Delirium">delirium</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316814" conceptname="Hyperventilation">hyperpnea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4178904" conceptname="Body temperature above reference range">hyperthermia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4253058" conceptname="Factor II deficiency">hypoprothrombinemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">restlessness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377575" conceptname="Tinnitus">Tinnitus</span> (ringing in the ears), and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>. The early signs of salicylic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">salicylism</span>), including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377575" conceptname="Tinnitus">tinnitus</span>, occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 Î¼g/mL. Plasma concentrations of aspirin above 300 Î¼g/mL are clearly toxic. Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above 400 Î¼g/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> may be expected at 30 g. For real or suspected <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, a Poison Control Center should be contacted immediately. Careful medical management is essential. In acute aspirin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, severe acid-base and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022093" conceptname="Electrolyte imbalance">electrolyte disturbances</span> may occur and are complicated by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4178904" conceptname="Body temperature above reference range">hyperthermia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435796" conceptname="Dehydration">dehydration</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4006309" conceptname="Respiratory alkalosis">Respiratory alkalosis</span> occurs early while <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316814" conceptname="Hyperventilation">hyperventilation</span> is present, but is quickly followed by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span>. Treatment of aspirin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> consists primarily of supporting vital functions, increasing salicylate elimination, and correcting the acid-base disturbance. Gastric emptying and/or lavage is recommended as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomited</span> spontaneously. After lavage and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> administration of activated charcoal, as a slurry, is beneficial, if less than 3 hours have passed since ingestion. Charcoal adsorption should not be employed prior to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> and lavage. </p>
<p>Severity of aspirin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> is determined by measuring the blood salicylate level. Acid-base status should be closely followed with serial blood gas and serum pH measurements. Fluid and electrolyte balance should also be maintained. In severe cases, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4178904" conceptname="Body temperature above reference range">hyperthermia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436375" conceptname="Hypovolemia">hypovolemia</span> are the immediate threats to life. Children should be sponged with tepid water. Replacement fluid should be administered intravenously and augmented with correction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidosis</span>. Plasma electrolytes and pH should be monitored to promote alkaline <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span> of salicylate if renal function is normal. Infusion of glucose may be required to control <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>.</p>
<p>Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis can be performed to reduce the body drug content. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> or in cases of life-threatening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>,  dialysis is usually required. Exchange transfusion may be indicated in infants and young children. Suicidal attempts with meprobamate have resulted in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437584" conceptname="Ataxia">ataxia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4061577" conceptname="Lethargy">lethargy</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4229897" conceptname="Stupor">stupor</span>, and respiratory and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443240" conceptname="Collapse">vasomotor collapse</span>. Some suicidal attempts have been fatal. The following data have been reported in the literature and from other sources. These data are not expected to correlate with each case (considering factors such as individual susceptibility and length of time from ingestion to treatment) but represent the usual ranges reported. Acute simple <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> (meprobamate alone): <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Death</span> has been reported with ingestion of as little as 12 grams meprobamate and survival with as much as 40 grams.</p>
<p>BLOOD LEVELS</p>
<p>0.5 to 2 mg percent represents the usual blood-level range of meprobamate after therapeutic doses. 3 to 10 mg percent usually corresponds to findings of mild to moderate symptoms of overdosage, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4229897" conceptname="Stupor">stupor</span> or light <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>. 10 to 20 mg percent usually corresponds to deeper <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>, requiring more intensive treatment. Some fatalities occur. At levels greater than 20 mg percent, more fatalities than survivals can be expected. Acute combined <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> (meprobamate with other CNS psychotropic drugs or alcohol): Since effects can be additive, a history of ingestion of a low dose of meprobamate plus any of these compounds (or of a relatively low blood or tissue level) cannot be used as a prognostic indicator.</p>
