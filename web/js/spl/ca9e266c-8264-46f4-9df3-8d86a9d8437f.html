                            is a complex molecule containing four sites at which different
                            stereochemical configurations can occur. The symmetry of the molecule,
                            however, results in only ten, instead of sixteen, possible different
                            isomers. The manufacture of atracurium besylate results in these isomers                being produced in unequal amounts but with a consistent ratio. Those
                            molecules in which the methyl group attached to the quaternary nitrogen
                            projects on the opposite side to the adjacent substituted-benzyl moiety
                            predominate by approximately 3:1.</p>

                            Injection is a sterile, non-pyrogenic aqueous solution for intravenous
                            administration. Each mL contains 10 mg atracurium besylate. The pH is
                            adjusted to 3.25 – 3.65 with benzenesulfonic acid. The multiple dose
                            vial contains 0.9% benzyl alcohol added as a preservative. Atracurium                Besylate Injection slowly loses potency with time at the rate of

                            refrigeration (5°C). Atracurium Besylate Injection should be
                            refrigerated at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F) to preserve potency. Rate of
                            loss in potency increases to approximately 5% per <span class="Italics">month</span> at 25°C (77°F). Upon removal

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"><a name="INV-ff683b54-7bb9-409a-a4b6-295db0b6f36c"></a>Atracurium besylate
                            is a nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant. Nondepolarizing agents
                            antagonize the neurotransmitter action of acetylcholine by binding
                            competitively with cholinergic receptor sites on the motor end-plate.
                            This antagonism is inhibited, and neuromuscular block reversed, by
                            acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine, edrophonium and
                            pyridostigmine.</p>
<p><a name="INV-d63b89a6-a0be-48c4-9781-f06d6044ecca"></a>Atracurium can be
                            used most advantageously if <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4247265" conceptname="Muscle twitch">muscle twitch</span> response to peripheral nerve
                            stimulation is monitored to assess degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">muscle relaxation</span>.</p>
<p><a name="INV-94fc3b3d-5763-402e-8605-b3ef90305f53"></a>The duration of
                            neuromuscular block produced by atracurium is approximately one-third to
                            one-half the duration of block by d-tubocurarine, metocurine, and
                            pancuronium at initially equipotent doses. As with other nondepolarizing
                            neuromuscular blockers, the time to onset of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440377" conceptname="Paralysis">paralysis</span> decreases and the
                            duration of maximum effect increases with increasing atracurium doses.</p>
<p><a name="INV-f6fe9349-733e-409a-8735-f7c3cf17cc02"></a>The ED<span class="Sub">95</span>(dose required to produce 95% suppression of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4247265" conceptname="Muscle twitch">muscle twitch</span>
                            response with balanced anesthesia) has averaged 0.23 mg/kg (0.11 to 0.26
                            mg/kg in various studies). An initial atracurium besylate dose of 0.4 to
                            0.5 mg/kg generally produces maximum neuromuscular block within 3 to 5
                            minutes of injection, with good or excellent intubation conditions
                            within 2 to 2.5 minutes in most patients. Recovery from neuromuscular
                            block (under balanced anesthesia) can be expected to begin approximately
                            20 to 35 minutes after injection. Under balanced anesthesia, recovery to
                            25% of control is achieved approximately 35 to 45 minutes after
                            injection, and recovery is usually 95% complete approximately 60 to 70
                            minutes after injection. The neuromuscular blocking action of atracurium
                            is enhanced in the presence of potent inhalation anesthetics. Isoflurane
                            and enflurane increase the potency of atracurium and prolong
                            neuromuscular block by approximately 35%; however, halothane’s
                            potentiating effect (approximately 20%) is marginal (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#INV-fdb144b6-d2f2-44b2-a3ea-dcf718bea440">DOSAGE AND
                                    ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>
<p><a name="INV-2ea20f29-6faf-421d-8d52-2d6c0e0a3130"></a>Repeated
                            administration of maintenance doses of atracurium has no cumulative
                            effect on the duration of neuromuscular block if recovery is allowed to
                            begin prior to repeat dosing. Moreover, the time needed to recover from
                            repeat doses does not change with additional doses. Repeat doses can
                            therefore be administered at relatively regular intervals with
                            predictable results. After an initial dose of 0.4 to 0.5 mg/kg under
                            balanced anesthesia, the first maintenance dose (suggested maintenance
                            dose is 0.08 to 0.10 mg/kg) is generally required within 20 to 45
                            minutes, and subsequent maintenance doses are usually required at
                            approximately 15 to 25 minute intervals.</p>
<p><a name="INV-f9483e3a-6f7b-4204-928e-cde8edddac75"></a>Once recovery from
                            atracurium’s neuromuscular blocking effects begins, it proceeds more
                            rapidly than recovery from d-tubocurarine, metocurine, and pancuronium.
                            Regardless of atracurium dose, the time from start of recovery (from
                            complete block) to complete (95%) recovery is approximately 30 minutes
                            under balanced anesthesia, and approximately 40 minutes under halothane,
                            enflurane or isoflurane. Repeated doses have no cumulative effect on
                            recovery rate.</p>
<p><a name="INV-bf2bf1e6-8aba-45f0-adda-344cd8ab6108"></a>Reversal of
                            neuromuscular block produced by atracurium can be achieved with an
                            anticholinesterase agent such as neostigmine, edrophonium, or
                            pyridostigmine, in conjunction with an anti-cholinergic agent such as
                            atropine or glycopyrrolate. Under balanced anesthesia, reversal can
                            usually be attempted approximately 20 to 35 minutes after an initial
                            atracurium besylate dose of 0.4 to 0.5 mg/kg, or approximately 10 to 30
                            minutes after a 0.08 to 0.10 mg/kg maintenance dose, when recovery of
                            <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4247265" conceptname="Muscle twitch">muscle twitch</span> has started. Complete reversal is usually attained within
                            8 to 10 minutes of the administration of reversing agents. Rare
                            instances of breathing difficulties, possibly related to incompletereversal, have been reported following attempted pharmacologic
                            antagonism of atracurium-induced neuromuscular block. As with other
                            agents in this class, the tendency for residual neuromuscular block is
                            increased if reversal is attempted at deep levels of block or if
                            inadequate doses of reversal agents are employed.</p>
<p><a name="INV-837ca285-0904-4f4c-af08-bab45ca1a9f0"></a>The
                            pharmacokinetics of atracurium in man are essentially linear within the
                            0.3 to 0.6 mg/kg dose range. The elimination half-life is approximately
                            20 minutes. THE DURATION OF NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCK PRODUCED BY ATRACURIUM
                            BESYLATE DOES NOT CORRELATE WITH PLASMA PSEUDOCHOLINESTERASE LEVELS AND
                            IS NOT ALTERED BY THE ABSENCE OF RENAL FUNCTION. This is consistent with
                            the results of <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies
                            which have shown that atracurium is inactivated in plasma via two
                            nonoxidative pathways: ester hydrolysis, catalyzed by nonspecific
                            esterases; and Hofmann elimination, a nonenzymatic chemical process
                            which occurs at physiological pH. Some placental transfer occurs in
                            humans.</p>
<p><a name="INV-5745c862-dcf7-4a3f-ae99-3e9867aeedc3"></a>Radiolabel studies
                            demonstrated that atracurium undergoes extensive degradation in cats,
                            and that neither kidney nor liver plays a major role in its elimination.                     Biliary and urinary excretion were the major routes of excretion of
                            radioactivity (totaling &gt;90% of the labeled dose within 7 hours
                            of dosing), of which atracurium represented only a minor fraction. The
                            metabolites in bile and urine were similar, including products of
                            Hofmann elimination and ester hydrolysis.</p>
<p><a name="INV-0bd01dd9-5187-4561-8697-2ee512fcd3be"></a>Elderly patients
                            may have slightly altered pharmacokinetic parameters compared to younger
                            patients, with a slightly decreased total plasma clearance which is
                            offset by a corresponding increase in volume of distribution. The net
                            effect is that there has been no significant difference in clinical
                            duration and recovery from neuromuscular block observed between elderly
                            and younger patients receiving atracurium besylate.</p>
<p><a name="INV-84528633-36bd-4064-a013-492034cf6873"></a>Atracurium is a
                            less potent histamine releaser than d-tubocurarine or metocurine.
                            Histamine release is minimal with initial atracurium besylate doses up
                            to 0.5 mg/kg, and hemodynamic changes are minimal within the recommended
                            dose range. A moderate histamine release and significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falls</span> in blood
                            pressure have been seen following 0.6 mg/kg of atracurium besylate. The
                            histamine and hemodynamic responses were poorly correlated. The effects
                            were generally short-lived and manageable, but the possibility of
                            substantial histamine release in sensitive individuals or in patients in
                            whom substantial histamine release would be especially hazardous (e.g.,
                            patients with significant cardiovascular disease) must be considered.</p>
<p><a name="INV-7263158a-e049-4a5e-b7b3-2132c96b4214"></a>It is not known
                            whether the prior use of other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking
                            agents has any effect on the activity of atracurium. The prior use of
                            succinylcholine decreases by approximately 2 to 3 minutes the time to
                            maximum block induced by atracurium, and may increase the depth of
                            block. Atracurium should be administered only after a patient recovers
                            from succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular block.</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First"><a name="INV-77287bc1-29ca-4b2e-b4ee-2b09526d8de4"></a>Although
                                    atracurium is a less potent histamine releaser than
                                    d-tubocurarine or metocurine, the possibility of substantial
                                    histamine release in sensitive individuals must be considered.
                                    Special caution should be exercised in administering atracurium
                                    to patients in whom substantial histamine release would be
                                    especially hazardous (e.g., patients with clinically significant
                                    cardiovascular disease) and in patients with any history (e.g.,
                                    severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4148381" conceptname="Anaphylactoid reaction">anaphylactoid reactions</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>) suggesting a greater
                                    risk of histamine release. In these patients, the recommended
                                    initial atracurium besylate dose is lower (0.3 to 0.4 mg/kg)
                                    than for other patients and should be administered slowly or in
                                    divided doses over one minute.</p>

                                    been rare in cases in which atracurium has been used. In studies

                                    is a need for long-term mechanical ventilation, the
                                    benefits-to-risk ratio of neuromuscular block must be
                                    considered. The long-term (1 to 10 days) infusion of atracurium
                                    besylate during mechanical ventilation in the ICU has been
                                    evaluated in several studies. Average infusion rates of 11 to 13
                                    mcg/kg/min (range: 4.5 to 29.5) were required to achieve
                                    adequate neuromuscular block. These data suggest that there is
                                    wide interpatient variability in dosage requirements. In
                                    addition, these studies have shown that dosage requirements may

<p class="First"><a name="INV-bddd4ac5-b611-4957-ab3f-d2fd78198122"></a>Atracurium besylate has been shown to be
                                                  potentially teratogenic in rabbits when given in
                                                  doses up to approximately one-half the human
                                                  dose. There are no adequate and well-controlled
                                                  studies in pregnant women. Atracurium should be
                                                  used during pregnancy only if the potential
                                                  benefit justifies the potential risk to the
                                                  fetus.</p>
<p><a name="INV-ccf8a8fd-c59f-4b2b-86f9-387c0e812aaf"></a>Atracurium besylate was administered

                                    besylate (0.3 mg/kg) has been administered to 26 pregnant women
                                    during delivery by cesarean section. No harmful effects were
                                    attributable to atracurium in any of the newborn infants,     although small amounts of atracurium were shown to cross the

                                    atracurium besylate dose should be lowered as

                                    patients required treatment for adverse reactions attributable

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First"><a name="INV-5703cf7f-cc22-4bfc-8b33-2eea72ac5fbd"></a>There has been
                            limited experience with atracurium besylate overdosage. The possibility
                            of iatrogenic overdosage can be minimized by carefully monitoring muscle
                            twitch response to peripheral nerve stimulation. Excessive doses of
                            atracurium can be expected to produce enhanced pharmacological effects.
                            Overdosage may increase the risk of histamine release and cardiovascular
                            effects, especially <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>. If cardiovascular support is necessary,
                            this should include proper positioning, fluid administration, and the
                            use of vasopressor agents if necessary. The patient’s airway should be
                            assured, with manual or mechanical ventilation maintained as necessary.
                            A longer duration of neuromuscular block may result from overdosage and
                            a peripheral nerve stimulator should be used to monitor recovery.
                            Recovery may be facilitated by administration of an anticholinesterase
                            reversing agent such as neostigmine, edrophonium, or pyridostigmine, in
                            conjunction with an anticholinergic agent such as atropine or
                            glycopyrrolate. The appropriate package inserts should be consulted for
                            prescribing information.</p>

                                            conditions for nonemergency intubation can be expected
                                            in 2 to 2.5 minutes in most patients, with maximum

                                            under balanced anesthesia. Under balanced anesthesia,                       recovery to 25% of control is achieved approximately 35
                                            to 45 minutes after injection, and recovery is usually

                                            administered at relatively regular intervals for each

                                            mg/kg), a diluted solution of atracurium besylate can be
                                            administered by continuous infusion to adults and

                                            neuromuscular block during extended surgical procedures.
                                            Infusion of atracurium should be individualized for each
                                            patient. The rate of administration should be adjusted
                                            according to the patient’s response as determined by
                                            peripheral nerve stimulation. Accurate dosing is best
                                            achieved using a precision infusion device.</p>
<p><a name="INV-822a8f43-4f40-41de-bb26-e496dd794611"></a>Infusion of atracurium should be initiated only after
                                            early evidence of spontaneous recovery from the bolus
                                            dose. An initial infusion rate of 9 to 10 mcg/kg/min may
                                            be required to rapidly counteract the spontaneous
                                            recovery of neuromuscular function. Thereafter, a rate
                                            of 5 to 9 mcg/kg/min should be adequate to maintain
                                            continuous neuromuscular block in the range of 89 to 99%                      in most pediatric and adult patients under balanced
                                            anesthesia. Occasional patients may require infusion
                                            rates as low as 2 mcg/kg/min or as high as 15
