<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Vinblastine sulfate is the salt of an alkaloid extracted from <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Vinca rosea </span></span>Linn., a common flowering herb known as the periwinkle (more properly known as <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Catharanthus roseus </span></span>G. Don). Previously, the generic name was vincaleukoblastine, abbreviated VLB.  It is a stathmokinetic oncolytic agent.  When treated <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">in vitro </span></span>with this preparation, growing cells are arrested in metaphase. </p>
<p>Chemical and physical evidence indicate that vinblastine sulfate is a dimeric alkaloid containing both indole and dihydroindole moieties.  The accompanying structural formula has been proposed. </p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="structure" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=f073b58e-56d6-4c8d-a2ce-b37719402d77&amp;name=vinblastine-sulfate-injection-figure-1-vinblastine-structure.jpg"></div>
<p>Each mL contains: Vinblastine sulfate 1 mg; sodium chloride 9 mg; benzyl alcohol 0.9% (v/v) as a preservative; Water for Injection q.s. (pH 3.5 to 5.0).</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Experimental data indicate that the action of vinblastine sulfate is different from that of other recognized antineoplastic agents.  Tissue-culture studies suggest an interference with metabolic pathways of amino acids leading from glutamic acid to the citric acid cycle and to urea.  <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">In vivo </span></span>experiments tend to confirm the <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">in vitro </span></span>results.  A number of studies <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">in vitro </span></span>and <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">in vivo </span></span>have demonstrated that vinblastine sulfate produces a stathmokinetic effect and various atypical mitotic figures.  The therapeutic responses, however, are not fully explained by the cytologic changes, since these changes are sometimes observed clinically and experimentally in the absence of any oncolytic effects.</p>
<p>Reversal of the antitumor effect of vinblastine sulfate by glutamic acid or tryptophan has been observed.  In addition, glutamic acid and aspartic acid have protected mice from lethal doses of vinblastine sulfate. Aspartic acid was relatively ineffective in reversing the antitumor effect. </p>
<p>Other studies indicate that vinblastine sulfate has an effect on cell-energy production required for mitosis and interferes with nucleic acid synthesis.  The mechanism of action of vinblastine has been related to the inhibition of microtubule formation in the mitotic spindle, resulting in an arrest of dividing cells at the metaphase stage.</p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with cancer have shown a triphasic serum decay pattern following rapid intravenous injection.  The initial, middle and terminal half-lives are 3.7 minutes, 1.6 hours and 24.8 hours, respectively.  The volume of the central compartment is 70% of body weight, probably reflecting very rapid tissue binding to formed elements of the blood. Extensive reversible tissue binding occurs.  Low body stores are present at 48 and 72 hours after injection.  Since the major route of excretion may be through the biliary system, toxicity from this drug may be in creased when there is hepatic excretory insufficiency.  The metabolism of vinca alkaloids has been shown to be mediated by hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes in the CYP 3A subfamily.  This metabolic pathway may be impaired in patients with hepatic dysfunction or who are taking concomitant potent inhibitors of these isoenzymes such as erythromycin. Enhanced toxicity has been reported in patients receiving concomitant erythromycin (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#edf33c0e-db2f-4f0e-b116-bd36c511ae1d">PRECAUTIONS</a></span></span>).  Following injection of tritiated vinblastine in the human cancer patient, 10% of the radioactivity was found in the feces and 14% in the urine; the remaining activity was not accounted for.  Similar studies in dogs demonstrated that, over nine days, 30 to 36% of radioactivity was found in the bile and 12 to 17% in the urine.  A similar study in the rat demonstrated that the highest concentrations of radioactivity were found in the lung, liver, spleen and kidney two hours after injection.</p>

<h2>Hematologic Effects<br>
</h2>
<p class="First">Clinically, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435224" conceptname="Leukopenia">leukopenia</span> is an expected effect of vinblastine sulfate, and the level of the leukocyte count is an important guide to therapy with this drug.  In general, the larger the dose employed, the more profound and longer lasting the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435224" conceptname="Leukopenia">leukopenia</span> will be.  The fact that the white blood cell count returns to normal levels after drug-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435224" conceptname="Leukopenia">leukopenia</span> is an indication that the white cell-producing mechanism is not permanently depressed.  Usually, the white count has completely returned to normal after the virtual disappearance of white cells from the peripheral blood. </p>
<p>Following therapy with vinblastine sulfate, the nadir in white blood cell count may be expected to occur five to ten days after the last day of drug administration.  Recovery of the white blood count is fairly rapid thereafter and is usually complete within another 7 to 14 days.  With the smaller doses employed for maintenance therapy, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435224" conceptname="Leukopenia">leukopenia</span> may not be a problem. </p>
<p>Although the thrombocyte count ordinarily is not significantly lowered by therapy with vinblastine sulfate, patients whose bone marrow has been recently impaired by prior therapy with radiation or with other oncolytic drugs may show <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span> (less than 200,000 platelets/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>).  When other chemotherapy or radiation has not been employed previously, thrombocyte reduction below the level of 200,000/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> is rarely encountered, even when vinblastine sulfate may be causing significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435224" conceptname="Leukopenia">leukopenia</span>.  Rapid recovery from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span> within a few days is the rule. </p>
<p>The effect of vinblastine sulfate upon the red cell count and hemoglobin is usually insignificant when other therapy does not complicate the picture.  It should be remembered, however, that patients with malignant disease may exhibit <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span> even in the absence of any therapy.</p>

</ul>
<p>Current principles of chemotherapy for many types of cancer include the concurrent administration of several antineoplastic agents.  For enhanced therapeutic effect without additive toxicity, agents with different dose-limiting clinical toxicities and different mechanisms of action are generally selected.  Therefore, although vinblastine sulfate is effective as a single agent in the aforementioned indications, it is usually administered in combination with other antineoplastic drugs.  Such combination therapy produces a greater percentage of response than does a single-agent regimen.  These principles have been applied, for example, in the chemotherapy of Hodgkin’s disease.</p>

<h2>Hodgkin's Disease<br>
</h2>
<p class="First">Vinblastine sulfate has been shown to be one of the most effective single agents for the treatment of Hodgkin’s disease.  Advanced Hodgkin’s disease has also been successfully treated with several multiple-drug regimens that included vinblastine sulfate.  Patients who had relapses after treatment with the MOPP program— mechlorethamine hydrochloride (nitrogen mustard), vincristine sulfate, prednisone and procarbazine—have likewise responded to combination-drug therapy that included vinblastine sulfate.  A protocol using cyclophosphamide in place of nitrogen mustard and vinblastine sulfate instead of vincristine sulfate is an alternative therapy for previously untreated patients with advanced Hodgkin’s disease. </p>
<p>Advanced testicular germinal-cell cancers (embryonal carcinoma, teratocarcinoma and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4092517" conceptname="Choriocarcinoma">choriocarcinoma</span>) are sensitive to vinblastine sulfate alone, but better clinical results are achieved when vinblastine sulfate is administered concomitantly with other antineoplastic agents.  The effect of bleomycin is significantly enhanced if vinblastine sulfate is administered six to eight hours prior to the administration of bleomycin; this schedule permits more cells to be arrested during metaphase, the stage of the cell cycle in which bleomycin is active.</p>

<p class="First">Since dose-limiting clinical toxicity is the result of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> of the white blood cell count, it is imperative that this count be obtained just before the planned dose of vinblastine sulfate.  Following administration of vinblastine sulfate, a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> in the white blood cell count may occur.  The nadir of this <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> is observed from 5 to 10 days following a dose.  Recovery to pretreatment levels is usually observed from 7 to 14 days after treatment.  These effects will be exaggerated when pre-existing bone marrow damage is present and also with the higher recommended doses (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#f734d228-74d8-49f8-899b-7295cf9a4cab">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span></span>).  The presence of this drug or its metabolites in blood or body tissues is not known to interfere with clinical laboratory tests.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions<br>
</h2>
<p class="First">The simultaneous oral or intravenous administration of phenytoin and antineoplastic chemotherapy combinations that included vinblastine sulfate has been reported to have reduced blood levels of the anticonvulsant and to have increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> activity.  Dosage adjustment should be based on serial blood level monitoring.  The contribution of vinblastine sulfate to this interaction is not certain.  The interaction may result from either reduced absorption of phenytoin or an increase in the rate of its metabolism and elimination. </p>
<p>Caution should be exercised in patients concurrently taking drugs known to inhibit drug metabolism by hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes in the CYP 3A subfamily, or in patients with hepatic dysfunction.  Concurrent administration of vinblastine sulfate with an inhibitor of this metabolic pathway may cause an earlier onset and/or an increased severity of side effects.  Enhanced toxicity has been reported in patients receiving concomitant erythromycin (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#b80c683b-3773-4b6d-8ae1-82ebc7cef2f9">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span></span>).</p>

<p>It is not clear from the literature how this drug affects synthesis of DNA and RNA.  Some believe that there is no interference.  Others believe that vinblastine interferes with nucleic acid metabolism but may not do so by direct effect but possibly as the result of biochemical disturbance in some other part of the molecular organization of the cell.  No inhibition of RNA synthesis occurred in rat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4101758" conceptname="Hepatocellular carcinoma">hepatoma</span> cells exposed in culture to noncytotoxic levels of vinblastine.  Conflicting results have been noted by others regarding interference with DNA synthesis. </p>

<p class="First">Side effects following the use of vinblastine sulfate are dose related.  Therefore, following administration of more than the recommended dose, patients can be expected to experience these effects in an exaggerated fashion.  (See <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#b0a50115-f8f1-4e7a-87c9-915070a9f30a">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span></span>, <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#bd5bbb91-4c4b-40d5-89e0-30e423cb67e4">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span></span>, <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#d9b55bc0-10d6-497f-9fe3-e0dfc5091d70">WARNINGS</a></span></span>, <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#edf33c0e-db2f-4f0e-b116-bd36c511ae1d">PRECAUTIONS</a></span></span> and <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#b80c683b-3773-4b6d-8ae1-82ebc7cef2f9">ADVERSE REAC TIONS</a></span></span>.)  There is no specific antidote.  In addition, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4024301" conceptname="Neurotoxicity">neurotoxicity</span> similar to that with vincristine sulfate may be observed.  Since the major route of excretion may be through the biliary system, toxicity from this drug may be increased when there is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic insufficiency</span>.</p>

<h2>Treatment</h2>
<p class="First">To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, a good resource is your certified Regional Poison Control Center.  Telephone numbers of certified poison control centers are listed in the <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Physicians’ Desk Reference (PDR)</span></span>.  In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">multiple drug overdoses</span>, interaction among drugs and unusual drug kinetics in your patient.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">Overdoses</span> of vinblastine sulfate have been reported rarely.  The following is provided to serve as a guide should such an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> be encountered. </p>
<p>Supportive care should include the following: (1) prevention of side effects that result from the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (this would include restriction of the volume of daily fluid intake to that of the urine output plus insensible loss and perhaps the administration of a diuretic affecting the function of the loop of Henle and the distal tubule); (2) administration of an anticonvulsant; (3) prevention of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="193518" conceptname="Intestinal obstruction">ileus</span>: (4) monitoring the cardiovascular system; and (5) determining daily blood counts for guidance in transfusion requirements and assessing the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>.  The major effect of excessive doses of vinblastine sulfate will be <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4145241" conceptname="Bone marrow depression">myelosuppression</span>, which may be life-threatening.  There is no information regarding the effectiveness of dialysis nor of cholestyramine for the treatment of overdosage. </p>
<p>Vinblastine sulfate in the dry state is irregularly and unpredictably absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration.  Absorption of the solution has not been studied.  If vinblastine is swallowed, activated charcoal in a water slurry may be given by mouth along with a cathartic.  The use of cholestyramine in this situation has not been reported. </p>
<p>Symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> will appear when greater-than-recommended doses are given.  Any dose of vinblastine sulfate that results in elimination of platelets and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4148615" conceptname="Neutrophil count">neutrophils</span> from blood and marrow and their precursors from marrow should be considered life-threatening.  The exact dose that will do this in all patients is unknown.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">Overdoses</span> occurring during prolonged consecutive-day infusions may be more toxic than the same total dose given by rapid intravenous injection.  The intravenous median lethal dose in mice is 10 mg/kg body weight; in rats, it is 2.9 mg/kg.  The oral median lethal dose in rats is 7 mg/kg. </p>
<p>Protect the patient’s airway and support ventilation and perfusion.  Meticulously monitor and maintain, within acceptable limits, the patient’s vital signs, blood gases, serum electrolytes, etc. Absorption of drugs from the gastrointestinal tract may be decreased by giving activated charcoal, which, in many cases, is more effective than <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> or lavage; consider charcoal instead of or in addition to gastric emptying if the drug has been swallowed.  Repeated doses of charcoal over time may hasten elimination of some drugs that have been absorbed.  Safeguard the patient’s airway when employing gastric emptying or charcoal.</p>

<h2>Adult Patients<br>
</h2>
<p class="First">It is wise to initiate therapy for adults by administering a single intravenous dose of 3.7 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> of body surface area (bsa).  Thereafter, white blood cell counts should be made to determine the patient’s sensitivity to vinblastine sulfate. </p>
<p>A simplified and conservative incremental approach to dosage <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">at weekly intervals </span></span>for adults may be outlined as follows: </p>
<p>            First dose ....................................... 3.7 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> bsa </p>
<p>            Second dose .................................. 5.5 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> bsa </p>
<p>            Third dose ...................................... 7.4 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> bsa </p>
<p>            Fourth dose .................................. 9.25 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> bsa </p>
<p>            Fifth dose ..................................... 11.1 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> bsa </p>
<p>The above-mentioned increases may be used until a maximum dose not exceeding 18.5 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> bsa for adults is reached.  The dose should not be increased after that dose which reduces the white cell count to approximately 3,000 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>.  In some adults, 3.7 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> bsa may produce this <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435224" conceptname="Leukopenia">leukopenia</span>; other adults may require more than 11.1 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> bsa; and, very rarely, as much as 18.5 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> bsa may be necessary.  For most adult patients, however, the weekly dosage will prove to be 5.5 to 7.4 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> bsa. </p>
<p>When the dose of vinblastine sulfate which will produce the above degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435224" conceptname="Leukopenia">leukopenia</span> has been established, a dose of <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">one increment smaller </span></span>than this should be administered at weekly intervals for maintenance. Thus, the patient is receiving the maximum dose that does not cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435224" conceptname="Leukopenia">leukopenia</span>.  <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">It should be emphasized that, even though seven days have elapsed, the next dose of vinblastine sulfate should not be given until the white cell count has returned to at least 4,000</span></span>/<span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">mm</span></span><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Sup">3</span></span></span>.  In some cases, oncolytic activity may be encountered before leukopenic effect.  When this occurs, there is no need to increase the size of subsequent doses (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#edf33c0e-db2f-4f0e-b116-bd36c511ae1d">PRECAUTIONS</a></span></span>).</p>

<h2>Pediatric Patients<br>
</h2>
<p class="First">A review of published literature from 1993 to 1995 showed that initial doses of vinblastine sulfate in pediatric patients varied depending on the schedule used and whether vinblastine sulfate was administered as a single agent or incorporated within a particular chemotherapeutic regimen.  As a single agent for Letterer-Siwe disease (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4264478" conceptname="Histiocytosis">histiocytosis</span> X), the initial dose of vinblastine sulfate was reported as 6.5 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>.  When vinblastine sulfate was used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of Hodgkin’s disease, the initial dose was reported as 6 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>.  For testicular germ cell carcinomas, the initial dose of vinblastine sulfate was reported as 3 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> in a combination regimen.  Dose modifications should be guided by hematologic tolerance.</p>

<h2>Patients with Renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic Impairment</span><br>
</h2>
<p class="First">A reduction of 50% in the dose of vinblastine sulfate is recommended for patients having a direct serum bilirubin value above 3 mg/100 mL.  Since metabolism and excretion are primarily hepatic, no modification is recommended for patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>.</p>
<p>The duration of maintenance therapy varies according to the disease being treated and the combination of antineoplastic agents being used.  There are differences of opinion regarding the duration of maintenance therapy with the same protocol for a particular disease; for example, various durations have been used with the MOPP program in treating Hodgkin’s disease. Prolonged chemotherapy for maintaining remissions involves several risks, among which are life-threatening infectious diseases, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4035976" conceptname="Sterility">sterility</span> and possibly the appearance of other cancers through suppression of immune surveillance.</p>
<p>In some disorders, survival following complete remission may not be as prolonged as that achieved with shorter periods of maintenance therapy.  On the other hand, failure to provide maintenance therapy in some patients may lead to unnecessary relapse; complete remissions in patients with testicular cancer, unless maintained for at least two years, often result in early relapse. </p>
<p>The dose of vinblastine sulfate (calculated to provide the desired amount) may be injected either into the tubing of a running intravenous infusion or directly into a vein.  The latter procedure is readily adaptable to outpatient therapy.  In either case, the injection may be completed in about one minute.  If care is taken to ensure that the needle is securely within the vein and that no solution containing vinblastine sulfate is spilled extra-vascularly, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435613" conceptname="Cellulitis">cellulitis</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318174" conceptname="Phlebitis">phlebitis</span> will not occur.  To minimize further the possibility of extra vascular spillage, it is suggested that the syringe and needle be rinsed with venous blood before withdrawal of the needle.  The dose should not be diluted in large volumes of diluent (i.e., 100 to 250 mL) or given intravenously for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4088438" conceptname="Prolonged periods">prolonged periods</span> (ranging from 30 to 60 minutes or more), since this frequently results in irritation of the vein and increases the chance of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4295895" conceptname="Extravasation">extravasation</span>. </p>
<p>Because of the enhanced possibility of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4130722" conceptname="Thrombosis">thrombosis</span>, it is considered inadvisable to inject a solution of vinblastine sulfate into an extremity in which the circulation is impaired or potentially impaired by such conditions as compressing or invading neoplasm, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318174" conceptname="Phlebitis">phlebitis</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441644" conceptname="Varicose veins of legs in pregnancy and the puerperium">varicosity</span>. </p>
<p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. </p>
<p>Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anti-cancer drugs should be considered.  Several guidelines on this subject have been published.<span class="Sup">4-10</span>   There is no general agreement that all of the procedures recommended in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate.</p>
