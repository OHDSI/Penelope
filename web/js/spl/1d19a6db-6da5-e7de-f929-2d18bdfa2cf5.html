<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ofloxacin tablets and other antibacterial drugs, ofloxacin tablets should be used only to treat or prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ofloxacin tablets is a synthetic broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent for oral administration. Chemically, ofloxacin, a fluorinated carboxyquinolone, is the racemate, (Â±)-9-fluoro-2,3-dihydro-3-methyl-10-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-7-oxo-7H-pyrido[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid. The chemical structure is:</p>
<p><img alt="structure" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=1d19a6db-6da5-e7de-f929-2d18bdfa2cf5&amp;name=structure.jpg"></p>
<p>Its empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">18</span>H<span class="Sub">20</span>FN<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">4</span>, and its molecular weight is 361.4. Ofloxacin is an off-white to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260836" conceptname="Blanching of skin">pale</span> yellow crystalline powder. The molecule exists as a zwitterion at the pH conditions in the small intestine. The relative solubility characteristics of ofloxacin at room temperature, as defined by USP nomenclature, indicate that ofloxacin is considered to be soluble in aqueous solutions with pH between 2 and 5. It is sparingly to slightly soluble in aqueous solutions with pH 7 (solubility <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falls</span> to 4 mg/mL) and freely soluble in aqueous solutions with pH above 9. Ofloxacin has the potential to form stable coordination compounds with many metal ions. This in vitro chelation potential has the following formation order: Fe<span class="Sup">+3 </span>&gt; Al<span class="Sup">+3</span> &gt; Cu<span class="Sup">+2</span> &gt; Ni<span class="Sup">+2</span> &gt; Pb<span class="Sup">+2</span> &gt; Zn<span class="Sup">+2</span> &gt; Mg<span class="Sup">+2</span> &gt; Ca<span class="Sup">+2</span> &gt; Ba<span class="Sup">+2</span>. Â </p>
<p>Ofloxacin tablets contain the following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, corn starch, hypromellose 5 cP, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate 80, pregelatinised starch, sodium starch glycolate, synthetic yellow iron oxide (for 200 mg and 400 mg tablet), and titanium dioxide. <span class="Bold">Â </span></p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Following oral administration, the bioavailability of ofloxacin in the tablet formulation is approximately 98%. Maximum serum concentrations are achieved one to two hours after an oral dose. Absorption of ofloxacin after single or multiple doses of 200 to 400 mg is predictable, and the amount of drug absorbed increases proportionately with the dose. Ofloxacin has biphasic elimination. Following multiple oral doses at steady-state administration, the half-lives are approximately 4â€“5 hours and 20â€“25 hours. However, the longer half-life represents less than 5% of the total AUC. Accumulation at steady-state can be estimated using a half-life of 9 hours. The total clearance and volume of distribution are approximately similar after single or multiple doses. Elimination is mainly by renal excretion. The following are mean peak serum concentrations in healthy 70â€“80 kg male volunteers after single oral doses of 200, 300, or 400 mg of ofloxacin or after multiple oral doses of 400 mg. </p>

<p>Steady-state concentrations were attained after four oral doses, and the area under the curve (AUC) was approximately 40% higher than the AUC after single doses. Therefore, after multiple-dose administration of 200 mg and 300 mg doses, peak serum levels of 2.2 Âµg/mL and 3.6 Âµg/mL, respectively, are predicted at steady-state.</p>
<p>In vitro, approximately 32% of the drug in plasma is protein bound.</p>
<p>The single dose and steady-state plasma profiles of ofloxacin injection were comparable in extent of exposure (AUC) to those of ofloxacin tablets when the injectable and tablet formulations of ofloxacin were administered in equal doses (mg/mg) to the same group of subjects. The mean steady-state AUC <span class="Sub">(0â€“12)</span> attained after the intravenous administration of 400 mg over 60 min was 43.5 Âµgâ€¢h/mL; the mean steady-state AUC<span class="Sub">(0â€“12) </span>attained after the oral administration of 400 mg was 41.2 Âµgâ€¢h/mL (two one-sided t-test, 90% confidence interval was 103â€“109). (See <span class="Bold">following chart</span>.)</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="graph" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=1d19a6db-6da5-e7de-f929-2d18bdfa2cf5&amp;name=graph.jpg"></div>
<p>Between 0 and 6 h following the administration of a single 200 mg oral dose of ofloxacin to 12 healthy volunteers, the average urine ofloxacin concentration was approximately 220 Âµg/mL. Between 12 and 24 hours after administration, the average urine ofloxacin level was approximately 34 Âµg/mL.</p>
<p>Following oral administration of recommended therapeutic doses, ofloxacin has been detected in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443720" conceptname="Blister">blister</span> fluid, cervix, lung tissue, ovary, prostatic fluid, prostatic tissue, skin, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4102774" conceptname="Productive cough">sputum</span>. The mean concentration of ofloxacin in each of these various body fluids and tissues after one or more doses was 0.8 to 1.5 times the concurrent plasma level. Inadequate data are presently available on the distribution or levels of ofloxacin in the cerebrospinal fluid or brain tissue.</p>
<p>Ofloxacin has a pyridobenzoxazine ring that appears to decrease the extent of parent compound metabolism. Between 65% and 80% of an administered oral dose of ofloxacin is excreted unchanged via the kidneys within 48 hours of dosing. Studies indicate that less than 5% of an administered dose is recovered in the urine as the desmethyl or N-oxide metabolites. Four to eight percent of an ofloxacin dose is excreted in the feces. This indicates a small degree of biliary excretion of ofloxacin.</p>
<p>The administration of ofloxacin tablets with food does not affect the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">âˆž</span> of the drug, but T<span class="Sub">max</span> is prolonged. </p>
<p>Clearance of ofloxacin is reduced in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> (creatinine clearance rate â‰¤50 mL/min), and dosage adjustment is necessary. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#preG">PRECAUTIONS: General </a></span>and <span class="Bold"><a href="#doad">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.</a></span>)Â </p>
<p>Following oral administration to healthy elderly subjects (65-81 years of age), maximum plasma concentrations are usually achieved one to two hours after single and multiple twice-daily doses, indicating that the rate of oral absorption is unaffected by age or gender. Mean peak plasma concentrations in elderly subjects were 9-21% higher than those observed in younger subjects. Gender differences in the pharmacokinetic properties of elderly subjects have been observed. Peak plasma concentrations were 114% and 54% higher in elderly females compared to elderly males following single and multiple twice-daily doses. [This interpretation was based on study results collected from two separate studies.] Plasma concentrations increase dose-dependently with the increase in doses after single oral dose and at steady state. No differences were observed in the volume of distribution values between elderly and younger subjects. As in younger subjects, elimination is mainly by renal excretion as unchanged drug in elderly subjects, although less drug is recovered from renal excretion in elderly subjects. Consistent with younger subjects, less than 5% of an administered dose was recovered in the urine as the desmethyl and N-oxide metabolites in the elderly. A longer plasma half-life of approximately 6.4 to 7.4 hours was observed in elderly subjects, compared with 4 to 5 hours for young subjects. Slower elimination of ofloxacin is observed in elderly subjects as compared with younger subjects which may be attributable to the reduced renal function and renal clearance observed in the elderly subjects. Because ofloxacin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> as recommended for all patients.(See <span class="Bold"><a href="#preG">PRECAUTIONS: General</a></span><span class="Bold"></span>and <span class="Bold"><a href="#doad">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span><span class="Bold">.</span>)</p>

<h2>MICROBIOLOGY</h2>
<p class="First">Ofloxacin is a quinolone antimicrobial agent. The mechanism of action of ofloxacin and other fluoroquinolone antimicrobials involves inhibition of bacterial topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase (both of which are type II topoisomerases), enzymes required for DNA replication, transcription, repair and recombination.</p>
<p>Ofloxacin has <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms. Ofloxacin is often bactericidal at concentrations equal to or slightly greater than inhibitory concentrations. </p>
<p>Fluoroquinolones, including ofloxacin, differ in chemical structure and mode of action from aminoglycosides, macrolides and Î²-lactam antibiotics, including penicillins. Fluoroquinolones may, therefore, be active against bacteria resistant to these antimicrobials.</p>
<p>Resistance to ofloxacin due to spontaneous mutation <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> is a rare occurrence (range: 10<span class="Sup">-9</span> to 10<span class="Sup">-11</span>). Although cross-resistance has been observed between ofloxacin and some other fluoroquinolones, some microorganisms resistant to other fluoroquinolones may be susceptible to ofloxacin.</p>
<p>Ofloxacin has been shown to be active against most <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of the following microorganisms both <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and in clinical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> as described in the <span class="Bold"><a href="#indi">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</a></span><span class="Bold"></span>section:</p>

<p>A report of â€œSusceptibleâ€? indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable. A report of â€œIntermediateâ€? indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where a high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of â€œResistantâ€? indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentration usually achievable; other therapy should be selected.</p>
<p>Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Standard ofloxacin powder should provide the following MIC values:</p>

One such standardized procedure<span class="Sup">2</span> requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 5-Âµg ofloxacin to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to ofloxacin. </p>
<p>Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with a 5-Âµg ofloxacin disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria:</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Prescribing ofloxacin tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432545" conceptname="Bacterial infectious disease">bacterial infection</span> or a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118659" conceptname="Prophylactic">prophylactic</span> indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.<span class="Bold">Â </span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"></span>Adequate hydration of patients receiving ofloxacin should be maintained to prevent the formation of a highly concentrated urine.Â </p>
<p>Administer ofloxacin with caution in the presence of renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic insufficiency</span>/impairment. In patients with known or suspected renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic insufficiency</span>/impairment, careful clinical observation and appropriate laboratory studies should be performed prior to and during therapy since elimination of ofloxacin may be reduced. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> (creatinine clearance Â£ 50 mg/mL), alteration of the dosage regimen is necessary.

<h3>Theophylline</h3>
<p class="First">Steady-state theophylline levels may increase when ofloxacin and theophylline are administered concurrently. As with other quinolones, concomitant administration of ofloxacin may prolong the half-life of theophylline, elevate serum theophylline levels, and increase the risk of theophylline-related adverse reactions. Theophylline levels should be closely monitored and theophylline dosage adjustments made, if appropriate, when ofloxacin is co-administered. Adverse reactions (including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>) may occur with or without an elevation in the serum theophylline level.

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment

<h2>Pregnancy</h2>
<p class="First">Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category C.</p>
<p>Ofloxacin has not been shown to have any teratogenic effects at oral doses as high asÂ 810 mg/kg/day (11 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> or 50 times based on mg/kg) and 160 mg/kg/day (4 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> or 10 times based on mg/kg) when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits, respectively. Additional studies in rats with oral doses up to 360 mg/kg/day (5 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> or 23 times based on mg/kg) demonstrated no adverse effect on late fetal development, labor, delivery, lactation, neonatal viability, or growth of the newborn. Doses equivalent to 50 and 10 times the recommended maximum human dose of ofloxacin (based on mg/kg) were fetotoxic (i.e., decreased fetal body weight and increased fetal mortality) in rats and rabbits, respectively. Minor skeletal variations were reported in rats receiving doses of 810 mg/kg/day, which is more than 10 times higher than the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>.Â </p>
<p>There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ofloxacin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#war">WARNINGS</a></span>.)</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">In lactating females, a single oral 200-mg dose of ofloxacin resulted in concentrations of ofloxacin in milk that were similar to those found in plasma. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from ofloxacin in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

<p>In phase 2/3 clinical trials with ofloxacin, 688 patients (14.2%) were â‰¥ 65 years of age. Of these, 436 patients (9.0%) were between the ages of 65 and 74 and 252 patients (5.2%) were 75 years or older. There was no apparent difference in the frequency or severity of adverse reactions in elderly adults compared with younger adults. The pharmacokinetic properties of ofloxacin in elderly subjects are similar to those in younger subjects. Drug absorption appears to be unaffected by age. Dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> (creatinine clearance rate â‰¤ 50 mL/min) due to reduced clearance of ofloxacin. In comparative studies, the frequency and severity of most drug-related nervous system events in patients â‰¥ 65 years of age were comparable for ofloxacin and control drugs. The only differences identified were an increase in reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> (3.9% vs 1.5%) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> (4.7% vs 1.8%) with ofloxacin. It is important to note that these geriatric safety data are extracted from 44 comparative studies where the adverse reaction information from 20 different controls (other antibiotics or placebo) were pooled for comparison with ofloxacin. The clinical significance of such a comparison is not clear.(See <span class="Bold"><a href="#clinic">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#doad">DOSAGE AND
ADMINISTRATION</a></span>.)</p>
<p>Elderly patients may be more sensitive to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. Therefore, precaution should be taken when using ofloxacin with concomitant drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (e.g. class IA or class III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135823" conceptname="Torsades de pointes">Torsade de pointes</span> (e.g. known QT prolongation, uncorrected <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>).

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">IInformation on overdosage with ofloxacin is limited. One incident of accidental overdosage has been reported. In this case, an adult female received 3 grams of ofloxacin intravenously over 45 minutes. A blood sample obtained 15 minutes after the completion of the infusion revealed an ofloxacin level of 39.3 Âµg/mL. In 7 h, the level had fallen to 16.2 Âµg/mL, and by 24 h to 2.7 Âµg/mL.

All complaints except the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span> subsided within 1 h after discontinuation of the infusion. The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, most bothersome while standing, resolved in approximately 9 h.

<p><span class="Bold">What is </span><span class="Bold">ofloxacin</span><span class="Bold">? </span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"></span>Ofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic medicine used in adults to treat certain <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> caused by certain germs called bacteria. It is not known if ofloxacin is safe and works in people under 18 years of age. Children less than 18 years of age have a higher chance of getting bone, joint, or tendon (musculoskeletal) problems such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span> while taking ofloxacin. </p>
<p>Sometimes <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> are caused by viruses rather than by bacteria. Examples include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440029" conceptname="Viral disease">viral infections</span> in the sinuses and lungs, such as the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">common cold</span> or flu. Antibiotics including ofloxacin do not kill viruses. Â </p>
<p>Call your healthcare provider if you think your condition is not getting better while you are taking ofloxacin. <span class="Bold">Â </span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"></span><span class="Bold">Who should not take </span><span class="Bold">Ofloxacin</span><span class="Bold">? </span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"></span>Do not take ofloxacin if you have ever had a severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergic reaction</span> to an antibiotic known as a fluoroquinolone, or are allergic to any of the ingredients in ofloxacin.

<li>are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. It is not known if ofloxacin will harm your unborn child </li>
<li>are breast-feeding or planning to breast-feed. Ofloxacin passes into breast milk. You and your healthcare provider should decide whether you will take ofloxacin or breast-feed. <br>Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements. Ofloxacin and other medicines can affect each other causing side effects. Especially tell your healthcare provider if you take: </li>
<li>an NSAID (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug). Many common medicines for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relief are NSAIDs. Taking an NSAID while you take ofloxacin or other fluoroquinolones may increase your risk of central nervous system effects and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>.

<li>Take ofloxacin exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider. </li>
<li>Take ofloxacin at about the same time each day. </li>
<li>Drink plenty of fluids while taking ofloxacin. </li>
<li>Ofloxacin can be taken with or without food. </li>
<li>Do not skip any doses, or stop taking ofloxacin, even if you begin to feel better, until you finish your prescribed treatment, unless: <ul>
<li>you have tendon effects (see â€œ<span class="Bold">What is the most important information I should know Â about </span><span class="Bold">ofloxacin</span><span class="Bold">?</span>â€?),</li>

<li>your healthcare provider tells you to stop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This will help make sure that all of the bacteria are killed and lower the chance that the bacteria will become resistant to ofloxacin. If this happens, ofloxacin and other antibiotic medicines may not work in the future.Â </li>
<li>If you miss a dose of ofloxacin, take it as soon as you remember. Do not take two doses of ofloxacin at the same time. Do not take more than two doses in one day.</li>
