<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Naltrexone hydrochloride, an opioid antagonist, is a synthetic congener of oxymorphone with no opioid agonist properties. Naltrexone differs in structure from oxymorphone in that the methyl group on the nitrogen atom is replaced by a cyclopropylmethyl group. Naltrexone hydrochloride is also related to the potent opioid antagonist, naloxone, or n-allylnoroxymorphone.<br><br>Naltrexone hydrochloride has the chemical name of 17-(cyclopropylmethyl)-4,5Î±-epoxy-3,14-dihydroxymorphinan-6-one hydrochloride.<br><br>It has the following structural formula:</p>

<h2>Pharmacodynamic Actions</h2>
<p class="First">Naltrexone is a pure opioid antagonist. It markedly attenuates or completely blocks, reversibly, the subjective effects of intravenously administered opioids.<br><br>When co-administered with morphine, on a chronic basis, naltrexone blocks the physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> to morphine, heroin and other opioids.<br><br>Naltrexone has few, if any, intrinsic actions besides its opioid blocking properties. However, it does produce some pupillary constriction, by an unknown mechanism.<br><br>The administration of naltrexone is not associated with the development of tolerance or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>. In subjects physically dependent on opioids, naltrexone will precipitate withdrawal symptomatology.<br></p>
<p>Clinical studies indicate that 50 mg of naltrexone hydrochloride will block the pharmacologic effects of 25 mg of intravenously administered heroin for periods as long as 24 hours. Other data suggest that doubling the dose of naltrexone hydrochloride provides blockade for 48 hours, and tripling the dose of naltrexone hydrochloride provides blockade for about 72 hours.<br><br>Naltrexone blocks the effects of opioids by competitive binding (i.e., analogous to competitive inhibition of enzymes) at opioid receptors. This makes the blockade produced potentially surmountable, but overcoming full naltrexone blockade by administration of very high doses of opiates has resulted in excessive symptoms of histamine release in experimental subjects.<br><br>The mechanism of action of naltrexone in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218106" conceptname="Alcoholism">alcoholism</span> is not understood; however, involvement of the endogenous opioid system is suggested by preclinical data. Naltrexone, an opioid receptor antagonist, competitively binds to such receptors and may block the effects of endogenous opioids. Opioid antagonists have been shown to reduce alcohol consumption by animals, and naltrexone has been shown to reduce alcohol consumption in clinical studies.<br><br>Naltrexone is not aversive therapy and does not cause a disulfiram-like reaction either as a result of opiate use or ethanol ingestion.<br><br></p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Naltrexone is a pure opioid receptor antagonist. Although well absorbed orally, naltrexone is subject to significant first pass metabolism with oral bioavailability estimates ranging from 5% to 40%. The activity of naltrexone is believed to be due to both parent and the 6-Î²-naltrexol metabolite. Both parent drug and metabolites are excreted primarily by the kidney (53% to 79% of the dose), however, urinary excretion of unchanged naltrexone accounts for less than 2% of an oral dose and fecal excretion is a minor elimination pathway. The mean elimination half-life (T-1/2) values for naltrexone and 6-Î²-naltrexol are 4 hours and 13 hours, respectively. Naltrexone and 6-Î²-naltrexol are dose proportional in terms of AUC and C<span class="Sub">max </span>over the range of 50 to 200 mg and do not accumulate after 100 mg daily doses.<br><br><span class="Bold">Absorption</span> â€“ Following oral administration, naltrexone undergoes rapid and nearly complete absorption with approximately 96% of the dose absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Peak plasma levels of both naltrexone and 6-Î²-naltrexol occur within one hour of dosing.<br><br><span class="Bold">Distribution</span> â€“ The volume of distribution for naltrexone following intravenous administration is estimated to be 1350 liters. In vitro tests with human plasma show naltrexone to be 21% bound to plasma proteins over the therapeutic dose range.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span> â€“ The systemic clearance (after intravenous administration) of naltrexone is ~3.5 L/min, which exceeds liver blood flow (~1.2 L/min). This suggests both that naltrexone is a highly extracted drug (&gt;98% metabolized) and that extrahepatic sites of drug metabolism exist. The major metabolite of naltrexone is 6-Î²-naltrexol. Two other minor metabolites are 2-hydroxy-3-methoxy-6-Î²-naltrexol and 2-hydroxy-3-methyl-naltrexone. Naltrexone and its metabolites are also conjugated to form additional metabolic products.<br><br><span class="Bold">Elimination</span> â€“ The renal clearance for naltrexone ranges from 30 to 127 mL/min and suggests that renal elimination is primarily by glomerular filtration. In comparison, the renal clearance for 6-Î²-naltrexol ranges from 230 to 369 mL/min, suggesting an additional renal tubular secretory mechanism. The urinary excretion of unchanged naltrexone accounts for less than 2% of an oral dose; urinary excretion of unchanged and conjugated 6-Î²-naltrexol accounts for 43% of an oral dose. The pharmacokinetic profile of naltrexone suggests that naltrexone and its metabolites may undergo enterohepatic recycling.<br><br><span class="Bold">Hepatic and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal Impairment</span></span> â€“ Naltrexone appears to have extrahepatic sites of drug metabolism and its major metabolite undergoes active tubular secretion (<span class="Italics">see </span><span class="Bold"> Metabolism </span>). Adequate studies of naltrexone in patients with severe hepatic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> have not been conducted (<span class="Italics">see </span><span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_section_id_2d5ac3b5-0271-4653-93c0-a49341602fc7">PRECAUTIONS, Special Risk Patients</a></span>).</p>

<h2>Clinical Trials</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218106" conceptname="Alcoholism">Alcoholism</span></span> â€“ The efficacy of naltrexone as an aid to the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218106" conceptname="Alcoholism">alcoholism</span> was tested in placebo-controlled, outpatient, double-blind trials. These studies used a dose of naltrexone hydrochloride 50 mg once daily for 12 weeks as an adjunct to social and psychotherapeutic methods when given under conditions that enhanced patient compliance. Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4182210" conceptname="Dementia">dementia</span>, and secondary psychiatric diagnoses were excluded from these studies.<br><br>In one of these studies, 104 alcohol-dependent patients were randomized to receive either naltrexone hydrochloride 50 mg once daily or placebo. In this study, naltrexone proved superior to placebo in measures of drinking including abstention rates (51% vs. 23%), number of drinking days, and relapse (31% vs. 60%). In a second study with 82 alcohol-dependent patients, the group of patients receiving naltrexone were shown to have lower relapse rates (21% vs. 41%), less <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218106" conceptname="Alcoholism">alcohol craving</span>, and fewer drinking days compared with patients who received placebo, but these results depended on the specific analysis used.<br><br>The clinical use of naltrexone as adjunctive pharmacotherapy for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218106" conceptname="Alcoholism">alcoholism</span> was also evaluated in a multicenter safety study. This study of 865 individuals with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218106" conceptname="Alcoholism">alcoholism</span> included patients with comorbid psychiatric conditions, concomitant medications, polysubstance abuse and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439727" conceptname="Human immunodeficiency virus infection">HIV disease</span>. Results of this study demonstrated that the side effect profile of naltrexone appears to be similar in both alcoholic and opioid dependent populations, and that serious side effects are uncommon.<br><br>In the clinical studies, treatment with naltrexone supported abstinence, prevented relapse and decreased alcohol consumption. In the uncontrolled study, the patterns of abstinence and relapse were similar to those observed in the controlled studies. Naltrexone was not uniformly helpful to all patients, and the expected effect of the drug is a modest improvement in the outcome of conventional treatment.<br></p>

<h2>Treatment of Opioid Addiction</h2>
<p class="First">Naltrexone has been shown to produce complete blockade of the euphoric effects of opioids in both volunteer and addict populations. When administered by means that enforce compliance, it will produce an effective opioid blockade, but has not been shown to affect the use of cocaine or other non-opioid drugs of abuse.<br><br>There are no data that demonstrate an unequivocally beneficial effect of naltrexone on rates of recidivism among detoxified, formerly opioid-dependent individuals who self-administer the drug. The failure of the drug in this setting appears to be due to poor medication compliance.</p>
<p>The drug is reported to be of greatest use in good prognosis opioid addicts who take the drug as part of a comprehensive occupational rehabilitative program, behavioral contract, or other compliance-enhancing protocol. Naltrexone, unlike methadone or LAAM (levo-alpha-acetylmethadol), does not reinforce medication compliance and is expected to have a therapeutic effect only when given under external conditions that support continued use of the medication.<br><br></p>

<h2>Individualization of Dosage</h2>

<p class="First">The placebo-controlled studies that demonstrated the efficacy of naltrexone as an adjunctive treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218106" conceptname="Alcoholism">alcoholism</span> used a dose regimen of naltrexone hydrochloride 50 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

<h2>Treatment of Opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">Dependence</span></h2>
<p class="First">Once the patient has been started on naltrexone hydrochloride, 50 mg once a day will produce adequate clinical blockade of the actions of parenterally administered opioids. As with many non-agonist treatments for addiction, naltrexone is of proven value only when given as part of a comprehensive plan of management that includes some measure to ensure the patient takes the medication.<br><br>A flexible approach to a dosing regimen may be employed to enhance compliance. Thus, patients may receive 50 mg of naltrexone hydrochloride every weekday with a 100 mg dose on Saturday or patients may receive 100 mg every other day, or 150 mg every third day. Several of the clinical studies reported in the literature have employed the following dosing regimen: 100 mg on Monday, 100 mg on Wednesday, and 150 mg on Friday. This dosing schedule appeared to be acceptable to many naltrexone patients successfully maintaining their opioid-free state.<br><br>Experience with the supervised administration of a number of potentially hepatotoxic agents suggests that supervised administration and single doses of naltrexone hydrochloride higher than 50 mg may have an associated increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">hepatocellular injury</span>, even though three-times a week dosing has been well tolerated in the addict population and in initial clinical trials in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218106" conceptname="Alcoholism">alcoholism</span>. Clinics using this approach should balance the possible risks against the probable benefits and may wish to maintain a higher index of suspicion for drug-associated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> and ensure patients are advised of the need to report nonspecific abdominal complaints (<span class="Italics">see </span><span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_precautions_id_7bd189b8-393f-41cc-a80f-a003cd4d1aba">PRECAUTIONS, </a><a href="#i4i_precautions_id_7bd189b8-393f-41cc-a80f-a003cd4d1aba">Information for Patients </a></span>).</p>

<p class="First">Evidence of the hepatotoxic potential of naltrexone is derived primarily from a placebo controlled study in which naltrexone hydrochloride was administered to obese subjects at a dose approximately five-fold that recommended for the blockade of opiate receptors (300 mg per day). In that study, 5 of 26 naltrexone recipients developed elevations of serum transaminases (i.e., peak ALT values ranging from a low of 121 to a high of 532; or 3 to 19 times their baseline values) after 3 to 8 weeks of treatment. Although the patients involved were generally clinically asymptomatic and the transaminase levels of all patients on whom follow-up was obtained returned to (or toward) baseline values in a matter of weeks, the lack of any transaminase elevations of similar magnitude in any of the 24 placebo patients in the same study is persuasive evidence that naltrexone is a direct (i.e., not idiosyncratic) hepatotoxin.<br><br>This conclusion is also supported by evidence from other placebo controlled studies in which exposure to naltrexone hydrochloride at doses above the amount recommended for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218106" conceptname="Alcoholism">alcoholism</span> or opiate blockade (50 mg/day) consistently produced more numerous and more significant elevations of serum transaminases than did placebo. Transaminase elevations in 3 of 9 patients with Alzheimerâ€™s Disease who received naltrexone hydrochloride (at doses up to 300 mg/day) for 5 to 8 weeks in an open clinical trial have been reported.<br><br>Although no cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic failure</span> due to naltrexone administration have ever been reported, physicians are advised to consider this as a possible risk of treatment and to use the same care in prescribing naltrexone as they would other drugs with the potential for causing hepatic injury.</p>

<h2>Unintended Precipitation of Abstinence</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">To prevent occurrence of an acute abstinence syndrome, or exacerbation of a pre-existing subclinical abstinence syndrome, patients must be opioid-free for a minimum of 7 to 10 days before starting naltrexone. Since the absence of an opioid drug in the urine is often not sufficient proof that a patient is opioid-free, a naloxone challenge should be employed if the prescribing physician feels there is a risk of precipitating a withdrawal reaction following administration of naltrexone. The naloxone challenge test is described in the <a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_93b44e9c-6c58-4e92-a46b-9928e11707d7">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a> section.</span></p>

<h2>Attempt to Overcome Blockade</h2>
<p class="First">While naltrexone is a potent antagonist with a prolonged pharmacologic effect (24 to 72 hours), the blockade produced by naltrexone is surmountable. This is useful in patients who may require <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, but poses a potential risk to individuals who attempt, on their own, to overcome the blockade by administering large amounts of exogenous opioids. Indeed, any attempt by a patient to overcome the antagonism by taking opioids is very dangerous and may lead to a fatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. Injury may arise because the plasma concentration of exogenous opioids attained immediately following their acute administration may be sufficient to overcome the competitive receptor blockade. As a consequence, the patient may be in immediate danger of suffering life endangering opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317109" conceptname="Respiratory arrest">respiratory arrest</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">circulatory collapse</span>). <span class="Underline">Patients should be told of the serious consequences of trying to overcome the opiate blockade (<span class="Italics">see </span><span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_precautions_id_7bd189b8-393f-41cc-a80f-a003cd4d1aba">PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients</a></span>).</span><br><br>There is also the possibility that a patient who had been treated with naltrexone will respond to lower doses of opioids than previously used, particularly if taken in such a manner that high plasma concentrations remain in the body beyond the time that naltrexone exerts its therapeutic effects. This could result in potentially life-threatening opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> (respiratory compromise or arrest, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">circulatory collapse</span>, etc.). <span class="Underline">Patients should be aware that they may be more sensitive to lower doses of opioids after naltrexone treatment is discontinued.</span><br></p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">When Reversal of Naltrexone Blockade is Required</span> â€“ In an emergency situation in patients receiving fully blocking doses of naltrexone, a suggested plan of management is regional <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, conscious sedation with a benzodiazepine, use of non-opioid analgesics or general anesthesia.<br><br>In a situation requiring opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, the amount of opioid required may be greater than usual, and the resulting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> may be deeper and more prolonged.<br><br>A rapidly acting opioid analgesic which minimizes the duration of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> is preferred. The amount of analgesic administered should be titrated to the needs of the patient. Non-receptor mediated actions may occur and should be expected (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4133326" conceptname="Facial swelling">facial swelling</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302654" conceptname="Itching">itching</span>, generalized <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256717" conceptname="Bronchospasm">bronchoconstriction</span>) presumably due to histamine release.<br><br>Irrespective of the drug chosen to reverse naltrexone blockade, the patient should be monitored closely by appropriately trained personnel in a setting equipped and staffed for cardiopulmonary resuscitation.<br><br><span class="Bold">Accidentally Precipitated Withdrawal</span> â€“ Severe opioid withdrawal syndromes precipitated by the accidental ingestion of naltrexone have been reported in opioid-dependent individuals. Symptoms of withdrawal have usually appeared within five minutes of ingestion of naltrexone and have lasted for up to 48 hours. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436222" conceptname="Altered mental status">Mental status changes</span> including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275889" conceptname="Visual hallucinations">visual hallucinations</span> have occurred.

In all cases patients were closely monitored and therapy with non-opioid medications was tailored to meet individual requirements.<br><br>Use of naltrexone does not eliminate or diminish withdrawal symptoms. If naltrexone is initiated early in the abstinence process, it will not preclude the patientâ€™s experience of the full range of signs and symptoms that would be experienced if naltrexone had not been started. Numerous adverse events are known to be associated with withdrawal.<br><br></p>

<h2>Special Risk Patients</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal Impairment</span></span> â€“ Naltrexone and its primary metabolite are excreted primarily in the urine, and caution is recommended in administering the drug to patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>.<br><br><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic Impairment</span></span> â€“ Caution should be exercised when naltrexone hydrochloride is administered to patients with liver disease. An increase in naltrexone AUC of approximately 5- and 10-fold in patients with compensated and decompensated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4064161" conceptname="Cirrhosis of liver">liver cirrhosis</span>, respectively, compared with subjects with normal liver function has been reported. These data also suggest that alterations in naltrexone bioavailability are related to liver disease severity.<br></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span></span> â€“ The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span> is known to be increased in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4279309" conceptname="Substance abuse">substance abuse</span> <span class="Underline">with or without</span> concomitant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>. This risk is not abated by treatment with naltrexone (<span class="Italics">see </span><span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_adverse_effects_id_659e6836-14dd-45a2-a8f5-4a8f35f0ca97">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span>).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Information for Patients</span> â€“ It is recommended that the prescribing physician relate the following information to patients being treated with naltrexone:<br><br>You have been prescribed naltrexone hydrochloride as part of the comprehensive treatment for your <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218106" conceptname="Alcoholism">alcoholism</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">drug dependence</span>. You should carry identification to alert medical personnel to the fact that you are taking naltrexone. A naltrexone medication card may be obtained from your physician and can be used for this purpose. Carrying the identification card should help to ensure that you can obtain adequate treatment in an emergency. If you require medical treatment, be sure to tell the treating physician that you are receiving naltrexone therapy.<br><br>You should take naltrexone as directed by your physician. If you attempt to self-administer heroin or any other opiate drug, in small doses while on naltrexone, you will not perceive any effect. <span class="Underline">Most important, however, if you attempt to self-administer large doses of heroin or any other opioid (including methadone or LAAM) while on naltrexone, you may die or sustain serious injury, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>.</span><br><br>Naltrexone is well-tolerated in the recommended doses, but may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver injury</span> when taken in excess or in people who develop liver disease from other causes. If you develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal pain</span> lasting more than a few days, white bowel movements, dark urine, or yellowing of your eyes, you should stop taking naltrexone immediately and see your doctor as soon as possible.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Laboratory Tests</span> â€“ A high index of suspicion for drug-related hepatic injury is critical if the occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver damage</span> induced by naltrexone is to be detected at the earliest possible time. Evaluations, using appropriate batteries of tests to detect <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver injury</span> are recommended at a frequency appropriate to the clinical situation and the dose of naltrexone.<br>Â <br>Naltrexone does not interfere with thin-layer, gas-liquid, and high pressure liquid chromatographic methods which may be used for the separation and detection of morphine, methadone or quinine in the urine. Naltrexone may or may not interfere with enzymatic methods for the detection of opioids depending on the specificity of the test. Please consult the test manufacturer for specific details.<br><br><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span> â€“ Studies to evaluate possible interactions between naltrexone and drugs other than opiates have not been performed. Consequently, caution is advised if the concomitant administration of naltrexone and other drugs is required.<br><br>The safety and efficacy of concomitant use of naltrexone and disulfiram is unknown, and the concomitant use of two potentially hepatotoxic medications is not ordinarily recommended unless the probable benefits outweigh the known risks.<br><br><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4061577" conceptname="Lethargy">Lethargy</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> have been reported following doses of naltrexone and thioridazine.<br><br>Patients taking naltrexone may not benefit from opioid containing medicines, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">cold</span> preparations, antidiarrheal preparations, and opioid analgesics. In an emergency situation when opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> must be administered to a patient receiving naltrexone, the amount of opioid required may be greater than usual, and the resulting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> may be deeper and more prolonged (<span class="Italics">see </span><span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_precautions_id_7bd189b8-393f-41cc-a80f-a003cd4d1aba">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>).<br><br><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility</span> â€“ The following statements are based on the results of experiments in mice and rats. The potential carcinogenic, mutagenic and fertility effects of the metabolite 6-Î²-naltrexol are unknown.<br><br>In a two-year carcinogenicity study in rats, there were small increases in the numbers of testicular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4033891" conceptname="Mesothelioma">mesotheliomas</span> in males and tumors of vascular origin in males and females. The incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4033891" conceptname="Mesothelioma">mesothelioma</span> in males given naltrexone at a dietary dose of 100 mg/kg/day (600 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day; 16 times the recommended therapeutic dose, based on body surface area) was 6%, compared with a maximum historical incidence of 4%. The incidence of vascular tumors in males and females given dietary doses of 100 mg/kg/day (600 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day) was 4%, but only the incidence in females was increased compared with a maximum historical control incidence of 2%. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity in a two-year dietary study with naltrexone in male and female mice.<br><br>There was limited evidence of a weak genotoxic effect of naltrexone in one gene mutation assay in a mammalian cell line, in the <span class="Italics">Drosophila</span> recessive lethal assay, and in nonspecific DNA repair tests with <span class="Italics">E. coli</span>. However, no evidence of genotoxic potential was observed in a range of other in vitro tests, including assays for gene mutation in bacteria, yeast, or in a second mammalian cell line, a chromosomal aberration assay, and an assay for DNA damage in human cells. Naltrexone did not exhibit clastogenicity in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay.<br><br>Naltrexone (100 mg/kg/day [600 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day] PO; 16 times the recommended therapeutic dose, based on body surface area) caused a significant increase in pseudopregnancy in the rat. A decrease in the pregnancy rate of mated female rats also occurred. There was no effect on male fertility at this dose level. The relevance of these observations to human fertility is not known.<br><br><span class="Bold">Pregnancy. </span><span class="Italics">Category C</span> â€“ Naltrexone has been shown to increase the incidence of early fetal loss when given to rats at doses â‰¥ 30 mg/kg/day (180 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day; 5 times the recommended therapeutic dose, based on body surface area) and to rabbits at oral doses â‰¥ 60 mg/kg/day (720 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day; 18 times the recommended therapeutic dose, based on body surface area). There was no evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> when naltrexone was administered orally to rats and rabbits during the period of major organogenesis at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (32 and 65 times the recommended therapeutic dose, respectively, based on body surface area).<br><br>Rats do not form appreciable quantities of the major human metabolite, 6-Î²-naltrexol; therefore, the potential reproductive toxicity of the metabolite in rats is not known.<br><br>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Naltrexone should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.<br><br><span class="Bold">Labor and Delivery</span> â€“ Whether or not naltrexone affects the duration of labor and delivery is unknown.<br><br><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers</span> â€“ In animal studies, naltrexone and 6-Î²-naltrexol were excreted in the milk of lactating rats dosed orally with naltrexone. Whether or not naltrexone is excreted in human milk is unknown. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when naltrexone is administered to a nursing woman.<br><br><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use</span> â€“ The safe use of naltrexone in pediatric patients younger than 18 years old has not been established.<br></p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">During two randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled 12 week trials to evaluate the efficacy of naltrexone as an adjunctive treatment of alcohol <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>, most patients tolerated naltrexone well. In these studies, a total of 93 patients received naltrexone hydrochloride at a dose of 50 mg once daily. Five of these patients discontinued naltrexone because of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>. No serious adverse events were reported during these two trials.<br><br>While extensive clinical studies evaluating the use of naltrexone in detoxified, formerly opioid-dependent individuals failed to identify any single, serious untoward risk of naltrexone use, placebo-controlled studies employing up to five-fold higher doses of naltrexone hydrochloride (up to 300 mg per day) than that recommended for use in opiate receptor blockade have shown that naltrexone causes <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">hepatocellular injury</span> in a substantial proportion of patients exposed at higher doses (<span class="Italics">see </span><span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_warnings_id_50d371ac-86d7-4730-b810-fd92ae72ce7c">WARNINGS</a></span><span class="Italics"> and </span><span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_precautions_id_7bd189b8-393f-41cc-a80f-a003cd4d1aba">PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests</a></span>).<br><br>Aside from this finding, and the risk of precipitated opioid withdrawal, available evidence does not incriminate naltrexone, used at any dose, as a cause of any other serious adverse reaction for the patient who is â€œopioid free.â€? It is critical to recognize that naltrexone can precipitate or exacerbate abstinence signs and symptoms in any individual who is not completely free of exogenous opioids.<br><br>Patients with addictive disorders, especially opioid addiction, are at risk for multiple numerous adverse events and abnormal laboratory findings, <span class="Underline">including liver function abnormalities</span>. Data from both controlled and observational studies suggest that these abnormalities, other than the dose-related hepatotoxicity described above, are not related to the use of naltrexone.<br><br>Among opioid free individuals, naltrexone administration at the recommended dose has not been associated with a predictable profile of serious adverse or untoward events. However, as mentioned above, among individuals using opioids, naltrexone may cause serious withdrawal reactions (<span class="Italics">see </span><span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_contraindications_id_02df70fb-f1e9-4461-b7bc-b218585a28fa">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span>, <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_warnings_id_50d371ac-86d7-4730-b810-fd92ae72ce7c">WARNINGS</a></span><span class="Italics"> and </span><span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_93b44e9c-6c58-4e92-a46b-9928e11707d7">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).<br><br></p>

<h2>Reported Adverse Events</h2>
<p class="First">Naltrexone has not been shown to cause significant increases in complaints in placebo-controlled trials in patients known to be free of opioids for more than 7 to 10 days. Studies in alcoholic populations and in volunteers in clinical pharmacology studies have suggested that a small fraction of patients may experience an opioid withdrawal-like symptom complex consisting of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4158475" conceptname="Crying associated with mood">tearfulness</span>, mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal cramps</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">restlessness</span>, bone or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77074" conceptname="Joint pain">joint pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442752" conceptname="Muscle pain">myalgia</span>, and nasal symptoms. This may represent the unmasking of occult opioid use, or it may represent symptoms attributable to naltrexone. A number of alternative dosing patterns have been recommended to try to reduce the frequency of these complaints (<span class="Italics">see </span><span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_section_id_222a3800-70fa-465c-8005-c4b89b3c93e1">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Individualization of Dosage</a></span>).</p>

<h2>Alternative Dosing Schedules</h2>
<p class="First">Once the patient has been started on naltrexone hydrochloride, 50 mg every 24 hours will produce adequate clinical blockade of the actions of parenterally administered opioids (i.e., this dose will block the effects of a 25 mg intravenous heroin challenge). A flexible approach to a dosing regimen may need to be employed in cases of supervised administration. Thus, patients may receive 50 mg of naltrexone hydrochloride every weekday with a 100 mg dose on Saturday, 100 mg every other day, or 150 mg every third day. The degree of blockade produced by naltrexone may be reduced by these extended dosing intervals.<br><br>There may be a higher risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">hepatocellular injury</span> with single doses above 50 mg, and use of higher doses and extended dosing intervals should balance the possible risks against the probable benefits (<span class="Italics">see </span><span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_warnings_id_50d371ac-86d7-4730-b810-fd92ae72ce7c">WARNINGS</a></span><span class="Italics"> and </span><span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_section_id_222a3800-70fa-465c-8005-c4b89b3c93e1">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Individualization of Dosage</a></span>).<br><br></p>

<h2>Patient Compliance</h2>
<p class="First">Naltrexone should be considered as only one of many factors determining the success of treatment. To achieve the best possible treatment outcome, appropriate compliance-enhancing techniques should be implemented for all components of the treatment program, including medication compliance.</p>
