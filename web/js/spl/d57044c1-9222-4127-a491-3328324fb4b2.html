<h2>Mechanism of Action </h2>
<p class="First">The precise mechanism(s) by which levetiracetam exerts its antiepileptic effect is unknown. The antiepileptic activity of levetiracetam was assessed in a number of animal models of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epileptic seizures</span>. Levetiracetam did not inhibit single <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> induced by maximal stimulation with electrical current or different chemoconvulsants and showed only minimal activity in submaximal stimulation and in threshold tests. Protection was observed, however, against secondarily generalized activity from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106574" conceptname="Partial seizure">focal seizures</span> induced by pilocarpine and kainic acid, two chemoconvulsants that induce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> that mimic some features of human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4236312" conceptname="Complex partial epileptic seizure">complex partial seizures</span> with secondary generalization. Levetiracetam also displayed inhibitory properties in the kindling model in rats, another model of human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4236312" conceptname="Complex partial epileptic seizure">complex partial seizures</span>, both during kindling development and in the fully kindled state. The predictive value of these animal models for specific types of human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> is uncertain.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> recordings of epileptiform activity from the hippocampus have shown that levetiracetam inhibits burst firing without affecting normal neuronal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">excitability</span>, suggesting that levetiracetam may selectively prevent hypersynchronization of epileptiform burst firing and propagation of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> activity.</p>
<p>Levetiracetam at concentrations of up to 10 Î¼M did not demonstrate binding affinity for a variety of known receptors, such as those associated with benzodiazepines, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), glycine, NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate), re-uptake sites, and second messenger systems. Furthermore, <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies have failed to find an effect of levetiracetam on neuronal voltage-gated sodium or T-type calcium currents and levetiracetam does not appear to directly facilitate GABAergic neurotransmission. However, <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies have demonstrated that levetiracetam opposes the activity of negative modulators of GABA- and glycine-gated currents and partially inhibits N-type calcium currents in neuronal cells.</p>
<p>A saturable and stereoselective neuronal binding site in rat brain tissue has been described for levetiracetam. Experimental data indicate that this binding site is the synaptic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443720" conceptname="Blister">vesicle</span> protein SV2A, thought to be involved in the regulation of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443720" conceptname="Blister">vesicle</span> exocytosis. Although the molecular significance of levetiracetam binding to synaptic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443720" conceptname="Blister">vesicle</span> protein SV2A is not understood, levetiracetam and related analogs showed a rank order of affinity for SV2A which correlated with the potency of their antiseizure activity in audiogenic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span>-prone mice. These findings suggest that the interaction of levetiracetam with the SV2A protein may contribute to the antiepileptic mechanism of action of the drug.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics </h2>
<p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam have been studied in healthy adult subjects, adults and pediatric patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>, elderly subjects and subjects with renal and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Overview </span></p>
<p>Levetiracetam is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration. Levetiracetam tablets and oral solution are bioequivalent. The pharmacokinetics are linear and time-invariant, with low intra- and inter-subject variability. The extent of bioavailability of levetiracetam is not affected by food. Levetiracetam is not significantly protein-bound (&lt; 10% bound) and its volume of distribution is close to the volume of intracellular and extracellular water. Sixty-six percent (66%) of the dose is renally excreted unchanged. The major metabolic pathway of levetiracetam (24% of dose) is an enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group. It is not liver cytochrome P450 dependent. The metabolites have no known pharmacological activity and are renally excreted. Plasma half-life of levetiracetam across studies is approximately 6 to 8 hours. It is increased in the elderly (primarily due to impaired renal clearance) and in subjects with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Absorption And Distribution </span></p>
<p>Absorption of levetiracetam is rapid, with peak plasma concentrations occurring in about an hour following oral administration in fasted subjects. The oral bioavailability of levetiracetam tablets is 100% and the tablets and oral solution are bioequivalent in rate and extent of absorption.Â  Food does not affect the extent of absorption of levetiracetam but it decreases C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 20% and delays T<span class="Sub">max</span> by 1.5 hours. The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam are linear over the dose range of 500 to 5000 mg. Steady state is achieved after 2 days of multiple twice-daily dosing. Levetiracetam and its major metabolite are less than 10% bound to plasma proteins; clinically significant interactions with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites are therefore unlikely.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Metabolism </span></p>
<p>Levetiracetam is not extensively metabolized in humans. The major metabolic pathway is the enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group, which produces the carboxylic acid metabolite, ucb L057 (24% of dose) and is not dependent on any liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The major metabolite is inactive in animal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> models. Two minor metabolites were identified as the product of hydroxylation of the 2-oxo-pyrrolidine ring (2% of dose) and opening of the 2-oxo-pyrrolidine ring in position 5 (1% of dose). There is no enantiomeric interconversion of levetiracetam or its major metabolite.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Elimination </span></p>
<p>Levetiracetam plasma half-life in adults is 7 Â± 1 hour and is unaffected by either dose or repeated administration. Levetiracetam is eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion as unchanged drug which represents 66% of administered dose. The total body clearance is 0.96 mL/min/kg and the renal clearance is 0.6 mL/min/kg. The mechanism of excretion is glomerular filtration with subsequent partial tubular reabsorption. The metabolite ucb L057 is excreted by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion with a renal clearance of 4 mL/min/kg. Levetiracetam elimination is correlated to creatinine clearance. Levetiracetam clearance is reduced in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> (see Special Populations, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal Impairment</span> and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Adult Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Impaired Renal Function</span>).</p>
<p><span class="Underline"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">Pharmacokinetic Interactions</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> data on metabolic interactions indicate that levetiracetam is unlikely to produce, or be subject to, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interactions</span>. Levetiracetam and its major metabolite, at concentrations well above Cmax levels achieved within the therapeutic dose range, are neither inhibitors of, nor high affinity substrates for, human liver cytochrome P450 isoforms, epoxide hydrolase or UDP-glucuronidation enzymes. In addition, levetiracetam does not affect the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> glucuronidation of valproic acid.</p>
<p>Potential <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interactions</span> of or with levetiracetam were assessed in clinical pharmacokinetic studies (phenytoin, valproate, warfarin, digoxin, oral contraceptive, probenecid) and through pharmacokinetic screening in the placebo-controlled clinical studies in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> patients (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).</p>
<p><br><span class="Underline">Special Populations</span><br><span class="Italics">Elderly </span><br>Pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were evaluated in 16 elderly subjects (age 61 to 88 years) with creatinine clearance ranging from 30 to 74 mL/min. Following oral administration of twice-daily dosing for 10 days, total body clearance decreased by 38% and the half-life was 2.5 hours longer in the elderly compared to healthy adults. This is most likely due to the decrease in renal function in these subjects.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients </span></p>
<p>Pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were evaluated in 24 pediatric patients (age 6 to 12 years) after single dose (20 mg/kg). The body weight adjusted apparent clearance of levetiracetam was approximately 40% higher than in adults.</p>
<p>A repeat dose pharmacokinetic study was conducted in pediatric patients (age 4 to 12 years) at doses of 20 mg/kg/day, 40 mg/kg/day, and 60 mg/kg/day. The evaluation of the pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam and its metabolite (ucb L057) in 14 pediatric patients demonstrated rapid absorption of levetiracetam at all doses with a Tmax of about 1 hour and a t1/2 of 5 hours across the three dosing levels. The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam in children was linear between 20 to 60 mg/kg/day. The potential interaction of levetiracetam with other AEDs was also evaluated in these patients (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Levetiracetam had no significant effect on the plasma concentrations of carbamazepine, valproic acid, topiramate or lamotrigine. However, there was about a 22% increase of apparent clearance of levetiracetam when it was co-administered with an enzyme-inducing AED (e.g. carbamazepine). Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that body weight was significantly correlated to clearance of levetiracetam in pediatric patients; clearance increased with an increase in body weight.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Gender </span></p>
<p>Levetiracetam Cmax and AUC were 20% higher in women (N=11) compared to men (N=12). However, clearances adjusted for body weight were comparable.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Race </span></p>
<p>Formal pharmacokinetic studies of the effects of race have not been conducted. Cross study comparisons involving Caucasians (N=12) and Asians (N=12), however, show that pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were comparable between the two races. Because levetiracetam is primarily renally excreted and there are no important racial differences in creatinine clearance, pharmacokinetic differences due to race are not expected.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal Impairment</span> </span></p>
<p>The disposition of levetiracetam was studied in adult subjects with varying degrees of renal function. Total body clearance of levetiracetam is reduced in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> by 40% in the mild group (CLcr = 50 to 80 mL/min), 50% in the moderate group (CLcr = 30 to 50 mL/min) and 60% in the severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> group (CLcr &lt; 30 mL/min). Clearance of levetiracetam is correlated with creatinine clearance.</p>
<p>In anuric (end stage <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>) patients, the total body clearance decreased 70% compared to normal subjects (CLcr &gt; 80 mL/min). Approximately 50% of the pool of levetiracetam in the body is removed during a standard 4-hour hemodialysis procedure.</p>
<p>Dosage should be reduced in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> receiving levetiracetam, and supplemental doses should be given to patients after dialysis (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Adult Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Impaired Renal Function</span>).</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic Impairment</span> </span></p>
<p>In subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) to moderate (Child-Pugh B) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>, the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were unchanged. In patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> (Child-Pugh C), total body clearance was 50% that of normal subjects, but decreased renal clearance accounted for most of the decrease. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of levetiracetam as adjunctive therapy (added to other antiepileptic drugs) in adults was established in three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies in patients who had refractory partial onset <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> with or without secondary generalization. The tablet formulation was used in all these studies. In these studies, 904 patients were randomized to placebo, 1000 mg, 2000 mg, or 3000 mg/day. Patients enrolled in Study 1 or Study 2 had refractory partial onset <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> for at least two years and had taken two or more classical AEDs. Patients enrolled in Study 3 had refractory partial onset <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> for at least 1 year and had taken one classical AED. At the time of the study, patients were taking a stable dose regimen of at least one and could take a maximum of two AEDs. During the baseline period, patients had to have experienced at least two partial onset <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> during each 4-week period.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Study 1 </span></p>
<p>Study 1 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted at 41 sites in the United States comparing levetiracetam 1000 mg/day (N=97), levetiracetam 3000 mg/day (N=101), and placebo (N=95) given in equally divided doses twice daily. After a prospective baseline period of 12 weeks, patients were randomized to one of the three treatment groups described above. The 18-week treatment period consisted of a 6-week titration period, followed by a 12-week fixed dose evaluation period, during which concomitant AED regimens were held constant. The primary measure of effectiveness was a between group comparison of the percent reduction in weekly partial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> frequency relative to placebo over the entire randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period).

<p> *statistically significant versus placebo </p>
<p>The comparison of levetiracetam 2000 mg/day to levetiracetam 1000 mg/day for responder rate was statistically significant (<span class="Italics">P</span>=0.02). Analysis of the trial as a cross-over yielded similar results.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Study 3 </span></p>
<p>Study 3 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted at 47 centers in Europe comparing levetiracetam 3000 mg/day (N=180) and placebo (N=104) in patients with refractory partial onset <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>, with or without secondary generalization, receiving only one concomitant AED. Study drug was given in two divided doses. After a prospective baseline period of 12 weeks, patients were randomized to one of two treatment groups described above. The 16-week treatment period consisted of a 4-week titration period, followed by a 12-week fixed dose evaluation period, during which concomitant AED doses were held constant. The primary measure of effectiveness was a between group comparison of the percent reduction in weekly <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> frequency relative to placebo over the entire randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period). Secondary outcome variables included the responder rate (incidence of patients with â‰¥ 50% reduction from baseline in partial onset <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> frequency).

<p>The effectiveness of levetiracetam as adjunctive therapy (added to other antiepileptic drugs) in pediatric patients was established in one multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study, conducted at 60 sites in North America, in children 4 to 16 years of age with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106574" conceptname="Partial seizure">partial seizures</span> uncontrolled by standard antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).

The study consisted of an 8-week baseline period and 4-week titration period followed by a 10-week evaluation period. Dosing was initiated at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day in two divided doses. During the treatment period, levetiracetam doses were adjusted in 20 mg/kg/day increments, at 2-week intervals to the target dose of 60 mg/kg/day. The primary measure of effectiveness was a between group comparison of the percent reduction in weekly partial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> frequency relative to placebo over the entire 14-week randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period).

<h1>WARNINGS </h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322252" conceptname="Suicidal behavior">Suicidal Behavior</span> and Ideation </span></p>
<p>Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including levetiracetam oral solution, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</p>
<p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322252" conceptname="Suicidal behavior">suicidal behavior</span> or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>.</p>
<p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</p>
<p>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 7 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</p>

<p>The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> and psychiatric indications.</p>

<p>Myoclonic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">Seizures</span></p>
<p>During clinical development, the number of patients with myoclonic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> exposed to levetiracetam was considerably smaller than the number with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106574" conceptname="Partial seizure">partial seizures</span>. Therefore, under-reporting of certain adverse events was more likely to occur in the myoclonic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> population. In adult and adolescent patients experiencing myoclonic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>, levetiracetam is associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> and behavioral abnormalities. It is expected that the events seen in partial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> patients would occur in patients with JME.</p>

Although it may be expected that drug related events seen in partial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> patients would be seen in primary generalized <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> patients (e.g. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437643" conceptname="Abnormal gait">gait disturbance</span>), these events may not have been observed because of the smaller sample size.</p>

<h2>Laboratory Tests </h2>
<p class="First">Although most laboratory tests are not systematically altered with levetiracetam treatment, there have been relatively infrequent abnormalities seen in hematologic parameters and liver function tests.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions </span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> data on metabolic interactions indicate that levetiracetam is unlikely to produce, or be subject to, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interactions</span>. Levetiracetam and its major metabolite, at concentrations well above Cmax levels achieved within the therapeutic dose range, are neither inhibitors of nor high affinity substrates for human liver cytochrome P450 isoforms, epoxide hydrolase or UDP-glucuronidation enzymes. In addition, levetiracetam does not affect the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> glucuronidation of valproic acid.</p>
<p>Levetiracetam circulates largely unbound (&lt; 10% bound) to plasma proteins; clinically significant interactions with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites are therefore unlikely.</p>
<p>Potential <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interactions</span> were assessed in clinical pharmacokinetic studies (phenytoin, valproate, oral contraceptive, digoxin, warfarin, probenecid) and through pharmacokinetic screening in the placebo-controlled clinical studies in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> patients.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Drug-Drug Interactions Between Levetiracetam And Other Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs) </span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Phenytoin </span></p>
<p>Levetiracetam (3000 mg daily) had no effect on the pharmacokinetic disposition of phenytoin in patients with refractory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>. Pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were also not affected by phenytoin.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Valproate </span></p>
<p>Levetiracetam (1500 mg twice daily) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of valproate in healthy volunteers. Valproate 500 mg twice daily did not modify the rate or extent of levetiracetam absorption or its plasma clearance or urinary excretion. There also was no effect on exposure to and the excretion of the primary metabolite, ucb L057.</p>
<p>Potential drug interactions between levetiracetam and other AEDs (carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone and valproate) were also assessed by evaluating the serum concentrations of levetiracetam and these AEDs during placebo-controlled clinical studies. These data indicate that levetiracetam does not influence the plasma concentration of other AEDs and that these AEDs do not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Effect Of AEDs In Pediatric Patients </span></p>
<p>There was about a 22% increase of apparent total body clearance of levetiracetam when it was co-administered with enzyme-inducing AEDs. Dose adjustment is not recommended. Levetiracetam had no effect on plasma concentrations of carbamazepine, valproate, topiramate, or lamotrigine.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">OtherÂ  DrugÂ  Interactions</span><br><span class="Italics">Oral Contraceptives</span><br>Levetiracetam (500 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel, or of the luteinizing hormone and progesterone levels, indicating that impairment of contraceptive efficacy is unlikely. Coadministration of this oral contraceptive did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Digoxin </span></p>
<p>Levetiracetam (1000 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (ECG) of digoxin given as a 0.25 mg dose every day. Coadministration of digoxin did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Warfarin </span></p>
<p>Levetiracetam (1000 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of R and S warfarin. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">Prothrombin</span> time was not affected by levetiracetam. Coadministration of warfarin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Probenecid </span></p>
<p>Probenecid, a renal tubular secretion blocking agent, administered at a dose of 500 mg four times a day, did not change the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam 1000 mg twice daily. C<span class="Sup">ss</span>max of the metabolite, ucb L057, was approximately doubled in the presence of probenecid while the fraction of drug excreted unchanged in the urine remained the same. Renal clearance of ucb L057 in the presence of probenecid decreased 60%, probably related to competitive inhibition of tubular secretion of ucb L057. The effect of levetiracetam on probenecid was not studied.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility </h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Underline">Carcinogenesis </span></p>
<p>Rats were dosed with levetiracetam in the diet for 104 weeks at doses of 50, 300 and 1800 mg/kg/day. The highest dose corresponds to 6 times the maximum recommended daily human dose (MRHD) of 3000 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis and it also provided systemic exposure (AUC) approximately 6 times that achieved in humans receiving the MRHD. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity. A study was conducted in which mice received levetiracetam in the diet for 80 weeks at doses of 60, 240 and 960 mg/kg/day (high dose is equivalent to 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> or exposure basis). Although no evidence for carcinogenicity was seen, the potential for a carcinogenic response has not been fully evaluated in that species because adequate doses have not been studied.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Mutagenesis </span></p>
<p>Levetiracetam was not mutagenic in the Ames test or in mammalian cells <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>in the Chinese hamster ovary/HGPRT locus assay. It was not clastogenic in an <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>analysis of metaphase chromosomes obtained from Chinese hamster ovary cells or in an<span class="Italics"> in vivo </span>mouse micronucleus assay. The hydrolysis product and major human metabolite of levetiracetam (ucb L057) was not mutagenic in the Ames test or the <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> assay.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Impairment Of Fertility </span></p>
<p>No adverse effects on male or female fertility or reproductive performance were observed in rats at doses up to 1800 mg/kg/day (approximately 6 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>or exposure basis).</p>

<h2>Pregnancy </h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Underline">Pregnancy Category C </span></p>
<p>In animal studies, levetiracetam produced evidence of developmental toxicity at doses similar to or greater than human therapeutic doses.</p>
<p>Administration to female rats throughout pregnancy and lactation was associated with increased incidences of minor fetal skeletal abnormalities and retarded offspring growth pre- and/or postnatally at doses â‰¥ 350 mg/kg/day (approximately equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose of 3000 mg [MRHD] on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) and with increased pup mortality and offspring behavioral alterations at a dose of 1800 mg/kg/day (6 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis). The developmental no effect dose was 70 mg/kg/day (0.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis). There was no overt maternal toxicity at the doses used in this study.</p>
<p>Treatment of pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased embryofetal mortality and increased incidences of minor fetal skeletal abnormalities at doses â‰¥ 600 mg/kg/day (approximately 4 times MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) and in decreased fetal weights and increased incidences of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079975" conceptname="Congenital malformation">fetal malformations</span> at a dose of 1800 mg/kg/day (12 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). The developmental no effect dose was 200 mg/kg/day (1.3 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis). Maternal toxicity was also observed at 1800 mg/kg/day.</p>
<p>When pregnant rats were treated during the period of organogenesis, fetal weights were decreased and the incidence of fetal skeletal variations was increased at a dose of 3600 mg/kg/day (12 times the MRHD). 1200 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD) was a developmental no effect dose. There was no evidence of maternal toxicity in this study.</p>
<p>Treatment of rats during the last third of gestation and throughout lactation produced no adverse developmental or maternal effects at doses of up to 1800 mg/kg/day (6 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Levetiracetam should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry</span><br>To provide information regarding the effects of in utero exposure to levetiracetam oral solution, physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking levetiracetam oral solution enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) pregnancy registry.Â  This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by the patients themselves.

<h2>Geriatric Use </h2>
<p class="First">Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of levetiracetam, 347 were 65 and over.

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS </h1>
<p class="First">The prescriber should be aware that the adverse event incidence figures in the following tables, obtained when levetiracetam was added to concurrent AED therapy, cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse experiences in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescriber with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied.</p>

<p>In the placebo-controlled study, 5.1% of patients receiving levetiracetam and 8.3% receiving placebo either discontinued or had a dose reduction during the treatment period as a result of a treatment-emergent adverse event.</p>
