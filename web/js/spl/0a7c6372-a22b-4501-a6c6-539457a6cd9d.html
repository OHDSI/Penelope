<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Nicardipine hydrochloride is a calcium ion influx inhibitor (slow channel blocker or calcium channel blocker). Nicardipine hydrochloride for intravenous administration contains 2.5 mg/mL of nicardipine hydrochloride. Nicardipine hydrochloride is a dihydropyridine derivative with IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) chemical name (Â±)-2-(benzyl-methyl amino) ethyl methyl 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-4-(<span class="Italics">m</span>-nitrophenyl)-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylate monohydrochloride and has the following structure:</p>

</div>
<p> Nicardipine hydrochloride is a greenish-yellow, odorless, crystalline powder that melts at about 169ÂºC. It is freely soluble in chloroform, methanol, and glacial acetic acid, sparingly soluble in anhydrous ethanol, slightly soluble in n-butanol, water, 0.01 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate, acetone, and dioxane, very slightly soluble in ethyl acetate, and practically insoluble in benzene, ether, and hexane. It has a molecular weight of 515.99. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is available as a sterile, non-pyrogenic, clear, yellow solution in 10 mL vials for intravenous infusion after dilution. Each mL contains 2.5 mg nicardipine hydrochloride in water for injection, USP with 48 mg sorbitol, NF, buffered to pH 3.5 with 0.525 mg citric acid monohydrate, USP and 0.09 mg sodium hydroxide, NF. Additional citric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added to adjust pH.</p>

<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Nicardipine inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine produced relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels which cause little or no negative inotropic effect.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</h2>
<p class="First">Following infusion, nicardipine plasma concentrations decline tri-exponentially, with a rapid early distribution phase (Î±-half-life of 2.7 minutes), an intermediate phase (Î²-half-life of 44.8 minutes), and a slow terminal phase (Î³-half-life of 14.4 hours) that can only be detected after long-term infusions. Total plasma clearance (Cl) is 0.4 L/hrâ€¢kg, and the apparent volume of distribution (V<span class="Sub">d</span>) using a non-compartment model is 8.3 L/kg. The pharmacokinetics of nicardipine hydrochloride injection are linear over the dosage range of 0.5 to 40 mg/hr.</p>
<p> Rapid dose-related increases in nicardipine plasma concentrations are seen during the first two hours after the start of an infusion of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. Plasma concentrations increase at a much slower rate after the first few hours, and approach steady state at 24 to 48 hours. On termination of the infusion, nicardipine concentrations decrease rapidly, with at least a 50% decrease during the first two hours post-infusion. The effects of nicardipine on blood pressure significantly correlate with plasma concentrations.</p>
<p> Nicardipine is highly protein bound (&gt; 95%) in human plasma over a wide concentration range. </p>
<p> Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been shown to be rapidly and extensively metabolized by the liver. After coadministration of a radioactive intravenous dose of nicardipine hydrochloride injection with an oral 30 mg dose given every 8 hours, 49% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 43% in the feces within 96 hours. None of the dose was recovered as unchanged nicardipine.</p>
<p> Nicardipine does not induce or inhibit its own metabolism and does not induce or inhibit hepatic microsomal enzymes. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (&gt; 65 years) and young healthy adults.</p>

<h2>Hemodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">Nicardipine hydrochloride injection produces significant decreases in systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span>. In a study of intra-arterially administered nicardipine hydrochloride injection, the degree of vasodilation and the resultant decrease in blood pressure were more prominent in hypertensive patients than in normotensive volunteers. Administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection to normotensive volunteers at dosages of 0.25 to 3 mg/hr for eight hours produced changes of &lt; 5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and &lt; 3 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure.</p>
<p> An increase in heart rate is a normal response to vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure; in some patients these increases in heart rate may be pronounced. In placebo-controlled trials, the mean increases in heart rate were 7 Â± 1 bpm in postoperative patients and 8 Â± 1 bpm in patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> at the end of the maintenance period. Hemodynamic studies following intravenous dosing in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317576" conceptname="Coronary arteriosclerosis">coronary artery disease</span> and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function have shown significant increases in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4108582" conceptname="Left ventricular ejection fraction">ejection fraction</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span> with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). There is evidence that nicardipine hydrochloride increases blood flow. Coronary dilatation induced by nicardipine hydrochloride injection improves perfusion and aerobic metabolism in areas with chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4200991" conceptname="Ischemia">ischemia</span>, resulting in reduced lactate production and augmented oxygen consumption. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317576" conceptname="Coronary arteriosclerosis">coronary artery disease</span>, nicardipine hydrochloride injection, administered after beta-blockade, significantly improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span> patients with impaired left ventricular function, nicardipine hydrochloride injection increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span> both at rest and during exercise. Decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were also observed. However, in some patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047088" conceptname="Left ventricular systolic dysfunction">left ventricular dysfunction</span>, it may have a negative inotropic effect and could lead to worsened failure.</p>
<p> â€œCoronary stealâ€? has not been observed during treatment with nicardipine hydrochloride injection. (Coronary steal is the detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317576" conceptname="Coronary arteriosclerosis">coronary artery disease</span> from underperfused areas toward better perfused areas.) Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has been shown to improve systolic shortening in both normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle. Radionuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during increased oxygen demand. (Occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving oral nicardipine. Whether this represents coronary steal in these patients, or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure, is not clear.)</p>
<p> In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317576" conceptname="Coronary arteriosclerosis">coronary artery disease</span>, nicardipine hydrochloride injection improves left ventricular diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction and reduced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4200991" conceptname="Ischemia">ischemia</span>. Nicardipine hydrochloride injection has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical benefits of these properties have not yet been demonstrated.</p>

<h2>Electrophysiologic Effects</h2>
<p class="First">In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system have been seen with nicardipine hydrochloride injection. During acute electrophysiologic studies, it increased heart rate and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. It did not affect sinus node recovery or SA conduction times. The PA, AH, and HV intervals* or the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged. The relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened.</p>
<p>*PA = conduction time from high to low right atrium; AH = conduction time from low right atrium to His bundle deflection, or AV nodal conduction time; HV = conduction time through the His bundle and the bundle branch-Purkinje system.</p>

<h2>Hepatic Function</h2>
<p class="First">Because the liver extensively metabolizes nicardipine, plasma concentrations are influenced by changes in hepatic function. In a clinical study with oral nicardipine in patients with severe liver disease, plasma concentrations were elevated and the half-life was prolonged (see <a href="#i4i_precautions_id_a8dfe4ee-7a34-4b18-b930-21f17ca7720e">PRECAUTIONS</a>). Similar results were obtained in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span> when nicardipine hydrochloride injection was administered for 24 hours at 0.6 mg/hr.</p>

<h2>Renal Function</h2>
<p class="First">When nicardipine hydrochloride injection was given to mild to moderate hypertensive patients with moderate degrees of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (RPF) was observed. No significant differences in liver blood flow were observed in these patients. A significantly lower systemic clearance and higher area under the curve (AUC) were observed. </p>
<p> When oral nicardipine (20 mg or 30 mg TID) were given to hypertensive patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>, mean plasma concentrations, AUC, and C<span class="Sub">max</span> were approximately 2-fold higher than in healthy controls. There is a transient increase in electrolyte excretion, including sodium (see <a href="#i4i_precautions_id_a8dfe4ee-7a34-4b18-b930-21f17ca7720e">PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>
<p> Acute bolus administration of nicardipine hydrochloride injection (2.5 mg) in healthy volunteers decreased mean arterial pressure and renal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span>; glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and the filtration fraction were unchanged. In healthy patients undergoing abdominal surgery, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (10 mg over 20 minutes) increased GFR with no change in RPF when compared with placebo. In hypertensive type II diabetic patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">nephropathy</span>, oral nicardipine (20 mg TID) did not change RPF and GFR, but reduced renal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span>.</p>

<h2>Pulmonary Function</h2>
<p class="First">In two well controlled studies of patients with obstructive airway disease treated with oral nicardipine, no evidence of increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256717" conceptname="Bronchospasm">bronchospasm</span> was seen.

<h2>Effects in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">Hypertension</span></h2>
<p class="First">In patients with mild to moderate chronic stable <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320128" conceptname="Essential hypertension">essential hypertension</span>, nicardipine hydrochloride injection (0.5 to 4 mg/hr) produced dose dependent decreases in blood pressure, although only the decreases at 4 mg/hr were statistically different from placebo. At the end of a 48-hour infusion at 4 mg/hr, the decreases were 26 mmHg (17%) in systolic blood pressure and 20.7 mmHg (20%) in diastolic blood pressure. In other settings (e.g., patients with severe or postoperative <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>), nicardipine hydrochloride injection (5 to 15 mg/hr) produced dose dependent decreases in blood pressure. Higher infusion rates produced therapeutic responses more rapidly. The mean time to therapeutic response for severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, defined as diastolic blood pressure â‰¤ 95 mmHg or â‰¥ 25 mmHg decrease and systolic blood pressure â‰¤ 160 mmHg, was 77 Â± 5.2 minutes. The average maintenance dose was 8 mg/hr. The mean time to therapeutic response for postoperative <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, defined as â‰¥ 15% reduction in diastolic or systolic blood pressure, was 11.5 Â± 0.8 minutes. The average maintenance dose was 3 mg/hr.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Rats treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 5, 15, or 45 mg/kg/day) for two years showed a dose-dependent increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135772" conceptname="Goiter">thyroid hyperplasia</span> and neoplasia (follicular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenoma</span>/carcinoma). One- and three-month studies in the rat have suggested that these results are linked to a nicardipine-induced reduction in plasma thyroxine (T4) levels with a consequent increase in plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Chronic elevation of TSH is known to cause hyperstimulation of the thyroid. In rats on an iodine deficient diet, nicardipine administration for one month was associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135772" conceptname="Goiter">thyroid hyperplasia</span> that was prevented by T4 supplementation. Mice treated with nicardipine in the diet (at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 18 months showed no evidence of neoplasia of any tissue and no evidence of thyroid changes. There was no evidence of thyroid pathology in dogs treated with up to 25 mg nicardipine/kg/day for one year and no evidence of effects of nicardipine on thyroid function (plasma T4 and TSH) in man. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of nicardipine in a battery of genotoxicity tests conducted on microbial indicator organisms, in micronucleus tests in mice and hamsters, or in a sister chromatid exchange study in hamsters. No impairment of fertility was seen in male or female rats administered nicardipine at oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose about 16 mg/kg/day, 8 times the maximum recommended oral dose).</p>

<h3><span class="Bold">Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category C</span></h3>
<p class="First">There are no adequate and well controlled studies of nicardipine use in pregnant women.

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Nicardipine is minimally excreted into human milk. Among 18 infants exposed to nicardipine through breast milk in the postpartum period, calculated daily infant dose was less than 0.3 mcg and there were no adverse events observed. Consider the possibility of infant exposure when using nicardipine in nursing mothers.</p>
<p> In a study of 11 women who received oral nicardipine 4 to 14 days postpartum, four women received immediate-release nicardipine 40 mg to 80 mg daily, six received sustained-release nicardipine 100 mg to 150 mg daily, and one received intravenous nicardipine 120 mg daily. The peak milk concentration was 7.3 mcg/L (range 1.9 to 18.8), and the mean milk concentration was 4.4 mcg/L (range 1.3 to 13.8). Infants received an average of 0.073% of the weight-adjusted maternal oral dose and 0.14% of the weight-adjusted maternal intravenous dose.</p>
<p> In another study of seven women who received intravenous nicardipine for an average of 1.9 days in the immediate postpartum period as therapy for preeclampsia, 34 milk samples were obtained at unspecified times and nicardipine was undetectable (&lt; 5 mcg/L) in 82% of the samples. Four women who received 1 to 6.5 mg/hour of nicardipine had six milk samples with detectable nicardipine levels (range 5.1 to 18.5 mcg/L). The highest concentration of 18.5 mcg/L was found in a woman who received 5.5 mg/hour of nicardipine. The estimated maximum dose in a breastfed infant was &lt; 0.3 mcg daily or between 0.015% to 0.004% of the therapeutic dose in a 1 kg infant.</p>

<h2>Use in the Elderly</h2>
<p class="First">The steady-state pharmacokinetics of nicardipine are similar in elderly hypertensive patients (&gt; 65 years) and young healthy adults.</p>
<p> Clinical studies of nicardipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, use low initial doses in elderly patients, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE EXPERIENCES</h1>
<p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials doses, however, provides a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.</p>
<p>Two hundred forty-four patients participated in two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of nicardipine hydrochloride injection. Adverse experiences were generally not serious and most were expected consequences of vasodilation. Adverse experiences occasionally required dosage adjustment. Therapy was discontinued in approximately 12% of patients, mainly due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>. </p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Several overdosages with orally administered nicardipine have been reported. One adult patient allegedly ingested 600 mg of nicardipine [standard (immediate-release) capsules], and another patient, 2160 mg of the sustained-release formulation of nicardipine. Symptoms included marked <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315078" conceptname="Palpitations">palpitations</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318566" conceptname="Flushing">flushing</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196636" conceptname="Dysarthria">slurred speech</span>. All symptoms resolved without sequelae. An overdosage occurred in a one-year-old child who ingested half of the powder in a 30 mg nicardipine standard capsule. The child remained asymptomatic.</p>
<p> Based on results obtained in laboratory animals, lethal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> may cause systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span> (following initial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>) and progressive atrioventricular conduction block.

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is intended for intravenous use. Titrate dose to achieve the desired blood pressure reduction. Individualize dosage depending on the blood pressure to be obtained and the response of the patient.</p>
<p> The time course of blood pressure decrease is dependent on the initial rate of infusion and the frequency of dosage adjustment. With constant infusion, blood pressure begins to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> within minutes. It reaches about 50% of its ultimate decrease in about 45 minutes.</p>
