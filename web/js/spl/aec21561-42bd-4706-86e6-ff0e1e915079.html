<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Actions:</span> The mechanism of action in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133835" conceptname="Eczema">Dermatitis</span> herpetiformis has not been established. By the kinetic method in mice, Dapsone is bactericidal as well as bacteriostatic against <span class="Italics">Mycobacterium leprae.</span></p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Absorption and Excretion:</span> Dapsone, when given orally, is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. About 85 percent of the daily intake is recoverable from the urine mainly in the form of water-soluble metabolites. Excretion of the drug is slow and a constant blood level can be maintained with the usual dosage.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Blood Levels:</span> Detected a few minutes after ingestion, the drug reaches peak concentration in 4-8 hours. Daily administration for at least eight days is necessary to achieve a plateau level. With doses of 200 mg daily, this level averaged 2.3 Î¼g/ml with a range of 0.1-7.0 Î¼g/ml. The half-life in the plasma in different individuals varies from ten hours to fifty hours and averages twenty-eight hours. Repeat tests in the same individual are constant. Daily administration (50 - 100 mg) in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432821" conceptname="Leprosy">leprosy</span> patients will provide blood levels in excess of the usual <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4190299" conceptname="Broth microdilution susceptibility test">minimum inhibitory concentration</span> even for patients with a short Dapsone half-life.

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>The patient should be warned to respond to the presence of clinical signs such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="26711" conceptname="Chronic pharyngitis">sore throat</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260836" conceptname="Blanching of skin">pallor</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047773" conceptname="Purpura">purpura</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Deaths</span> associated with the administration of Dapsone have been reported from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440689" conceptname="Agranulocytosis">agranulocytosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137829" conceptname="Aplastic anemia">aplastic anemia</span> and other <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="40528016" conceptname="Disorder of hematopoietic system">blood dyscrasias</span>. Complete blood counts should be done frequently in patients receiving Dapsone. The FDA Dermatology Advisory Committee recommended that, when feasible, counts should be done weekly for the first month, monthly for six months and semi-annually thereafter. If a significant reduction in leucocytes, platelets or hemopoiesis is noted, Dapsone should be discontinued and the patient followed intensively. Folic acid antagonists have similar effects and may increase the incidence of hematologic reactions; if co-administered with Dapsone the patient should be monitored more frequently. Patients on weekly pyrimethamine and Dapsone have developed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440689" conceptname="Agranulocytosis">agranulocytosis</span> during the second and third month of therapy.
</p>
<p>Severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span> should be treated prior to initiation of therapy and hemoglobin monitored. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126829" conceptname="Hemolysis">Hemolysis</span> and methemoglobin may be poorly tolerated by patients with severe cardiopulmonary disease.
</p>
<p>Cutaneous reactions, especially bullous, include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4270887" conceptname="Erythroderma">exfoliative dermatitis</span> and are probably one of the most serious, though rare, complications of sulfone therapy. They are directly due to drug sensitization. Such reactions include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="141370" conceptname="Toxic erythema">toxic erythema</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="132702" conceptname="Erythema multiforme">erythema multiforme</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443754" conceptname="Lyell's toxic epidermal necrolysis, subepidermal type">toxic epidermal necrolysis</span>, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="139900" conceptname="Urticaria">urticaria</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140176" conceptname="Erythema nodosum">erythema nodosum</span>.

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p><span class="Bold">General:</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126829" conceptname="Hemolysis">Hemolysis</span> and Heinz body formation may be exaggerated in individuals with a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, or methemoglobin reductase deficiency, or hemoglobin M. This reaction is frequently dose-related. Dapsone should be given with caution to these patients or if the patient is exposed to other agents or conditions such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443727" conceptname="Diabetic ketoacidosis">diabetic ketosis</span> capable of producing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126829" conceptname="Hemolysis">hemolysis</span>. Drugs or chemicals which have produced significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126829" conceptname="Hemolysis">hemolysis</span> in G6PD or methemoglobin reductase deficient patients include Dapsone, sulfanilamide, nitrite, aniline, phenylhydrazine, napthalene, niridazole, nitro-furantoin and 8-amino-antimalarials such as primaquine.
</p>
<p>Toxic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185719" conceptname="Cholestatic jaundice syndrome">cholestatic jaundice</span> have been reported early in therapy. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4032334" conceptname="Hyperbilirubinemia">Hyperbilirubinemia</span> may occur more often in G6PD deficient patients. When feasible, baseline and subsequent monitoring of liver function is recommended; if abnormal, Dapsone should be discontinued until the source of the abnormality is established.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions:</span> Rifampin lowers Dapsone levels 7 to 10-fold by accelerating plasma clearance; in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432821" conceptname="Leprosy">leprosy</span> this reduction has not required a change in dosage. Folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine may increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions.
</p>
<p>A modest interaction has been reported for patients receiving 100 mg Dapsone daily in combination with trimethoprim 5 mg/kg q6h. On Day 7, the serum Dapsone levels averaged 2.1 Â± 1.0 Î¼g/mL in comparison to 1.5 Â± 0.5 Î¼g/mL for Dapsone alone. On Day 7, trimethoprim levels averaged 18.4 Â± 5.2 Î¼g/mL in comparison to 12.4 Â± 4.5 Î¼g/mL for patients not receiving Dapsone. Thus, there is a mutual interaction between Dapsone and trimethoprim in which each raises the level of the other about 1.5 times.
</p>
<p>A crossover study<span class="Sup">1</span> designed to assess the potential of a drug interaction between Dapsone, 100 mg/day and trimethoprim, 200 mg every 12 hours, in eight asymptomatic HIV positive volunteers (average CD4 count 524 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>) demonstrated that there was not a significant drug intreraction between Dapsone and trimethoprim. However, an earlier report<span class="Sup">2</span> also by Lee et al, in 78 HIV infected patients with acute <span class="Italics">Pneumocystis carinii</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255848" conceptname="Pneumonia">pneumonia</span>, receiving Dapsone, 100 mg/day and higher trimethoprim dose, 20 mg/kg/day, demonstrated that the serum levels of Dapsone were increased by 40% and trimethoprim levels were increased by 48% when the drugs were administered concurrently.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis:</span> Dapsone has been found carcinogenic (sarcomagenic) for male rats and female mice causing mesenchymal tumors in the spleen and peritoneum, and thyroid carcinoma in female rats. Dapsone is not mutagenic with or without microsomal activation in <span class="Italics">S. typhimurium</span> tester <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> 1535, 1537, 1538, 98, or 100.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category C:</span> Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Dapsone. Extensive, but uncontrolled experience and two published surveys on the use of Dapsone in pregnant women have not shown that Dapsone increases the risk of fetal abnormalities if administered during all trimesters of pregnancy or can affect reproduction capacity. Because of the lack of animal studies or controlled human experience, Dapsone should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. In general, for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432821" conceptname="Leprosy">leprosy</span>, USPHS at Carville recommends maintenance of Dapsone. Dapsone has been important for the management of some pregnant D.H. patients.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers:</span> Dapsone is excreted in breast milk in substantial amounts. Hemolytic reactions can occur in neonates. See section on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126829" conceptname="Hemolysis">hemolysis</span>. Because of the potential for tumorgenicity shown for Dapsone in animal studies a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of drug to the mother.
</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use:</span> Pediatric patients are treated on the same schedule as adults but with correspondingly smaller doses. Dapsone is generally not considered to have an effect on the later growth, development and functional development of the pediatric patient.

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>In addition to the warnings listed above, the following syndromes and serious reactions have been reported in patients on Dapsone.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Hematologic Effects:</span> Dose-related <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126829" conceptname="Hemolysis">hemolysis</span> is the most common adverse effect and is seen in patients with or without G6PD deficiency. Almost all patients demonstrate the inter-related changes of a loss of 1-2g of hemoglobin, an increase in the reticulocytes (2-12%), a shortened red cell life span and a rise in methemoglobin. G6PD deficient patients have greater responses.
</p>
<p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Nervous System Effects:</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197608" conceptname="Peripheral neuritis in pregnancy">Peripheral neuropathy</span> is a definite but unusual complication of Dapsone therapy in non-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432821" conceptname="Leprosy">leprosy</span> patients. Motor loss is predominant. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79908" conceptname="Muscle weakness">muscle weakness</span> appears, Dapsone should be withdrawn. Recovery on withdrawal is usually substantially complete. The mechanism of recovery is reported by axonal regeneration. Some recovered patients have tolerated retreatment at reduced dosage. In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432821" conceptname="Leprosy">leprosy</span> this complication may be difficult to distinguish from a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432821" conceptname="Leprosy">leprosy</span> reactional state.

Methemoglobin induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> or severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438555" conceptname="Cyanosis">cyanosis</span> requires prompt treatment. In normal and methemoglobin reductase deficient patients, methylene blue, 1-2 mg/kg of body weight, given slowly intravenously, is the treatment of choice. The effect is complete in 30 minutes, but may have to be repeated if methemoglobin reaccumulates. For non-emergencies, if treatment is needed, methylene blue may be given orally in doses of 3-5 mg/kg every 4-6 hours. Methylene blue reduction depends on G6PD and should not be given to fully expressed G6PD deficient patients.

<h1>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133835" conceptname="Eczema">Dermatitis</span> herpetiformis:</span> The dosage should be individually titrated starting in adults with 50 mg daily and correspondingly smaller doses in children. If full control is not achieved within the range of 50-300 mg daily, higher doses may be tried. Dosage should be reduced to a minimum maintenance level as soon as possible. In responsive patients there is a prompt reduction in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span> followed by clearance of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4316083" conceptname="Skin lesion">skin lesions</span>. There is no effect on the gastrointestinal component of the disease. Dapsone levels are influenced by acetylation rates. Patients with high acetylation rates, or who are receiving treatment affecting acetylation may require an adjustment in dosage.
</p>
<p>A strict gluten free diet is an option for the patient to elect, permitting many to reduce or eliminate the need for Dapsone; the average time for dosage reduction is 8 months with a range of 4 months to 2 1/2 years and for dosage elimination 29 months with a range of 6 months to 9 years.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432821" conceptname="Leprosy">Leprosy</span>:</span> In order to reduce secondary Dapsone resistance, the WHO Expert Committee on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432821" conceptname="Leprosy">Leprosy</span> and the USPHS at Carville, LA, recommended that Dapsone should be commenced in combination with one or more anti-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432821" conceptname="Leprosy">leprosy</span> drugs. In the multidrug program Dapsone should be maintained at the full dosage of 100 mg daily without interruption (with corresponding smaller doses for children) and provided to all patients who have sensitive organisms with new or recrudescent disease or who have not yet completed a two year course of Dapsone monotherapy. For advice and other drugs, the USPHS at Carville, LA (1-800-642-2477) should be contacted. Before using other drugs consult appropriate product labeling.
</p>
<p>In bacteriologically negative tuberculoid and indeterminate disease, the recommendation is the coadministration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with six months of Rifampin 600 mg daily. Under WHO, daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised. The Dapsone is continued until all signs of clinical activity are controlled - usually after an additional six months. Then Dapsone should be continued for an additional three years for tuberculoid and indeterminate patients and for five years for borderline tuberculoid patients.
</p>
<p>In lepromatous and borderline lepromatous patients, the recommendation is the co-administration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with two years of Rifampin 600 mg daily. Under WHO daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised. One may elect the concurrent administration of a third anti-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432821" conceptname="Leprosy">leprosy</span> drug, usually either Clofazamine 50-100 mg daily or Ethionamide 250-500 mg daily. Dapsone 100 mg daily is continued 3-10 years until all signs of clinical activity are controlled with skin scrapings and biopsies negative for one year. Dapsone should then be continued for an additional 10 years for borderline patients and for life for lepromatous patients.
</p>
<p>Secondary Dapsone resistance should be suspected whenever a lepromatous or borderline lepromatous patient receiving Dapsone treatment relapses clinically and bacteriologically, solid staining bacilli being found in the smears taken from the new active lesions. If such cases show no response to regular and supervised Dapsone therapy within three to six months or good compliance for the past 3-6 months can be assured, Dapsone resistance should be considered confirmed clinically. Determination of drug sensitivity using the mouse footpad method is recommended and, after prior arrangement, is available without charge from the USPHS, Carville, LA. Patients with proven Dapsone resistance should be treated with other drugs.

<p>Abrupt changes in clinical activity occur in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432821" conceptname="Leprosy">leprosy</span> with any effective treatment and are known as reactional states. The majority can be classified into two groups. The â€œReversalâ€? reaction (Type 1) may occur in borderline or tuberculoid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432821" conceptname="Leprosy">leprosy</span> patients often soon after chemotherapy is started. The mechanism is presumed to result from a reduction in the antigenic load: the patient is able to mount an enhanced delayed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> response to residual <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> leading to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span> (â€œReversalâ€?) of existing skin and nerve lesions.
