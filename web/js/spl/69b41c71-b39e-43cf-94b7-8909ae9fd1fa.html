<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Lisinopril inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. The beneficial effects of lisinopril in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> appear to result primarily from suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. In hypertensive patients with normal renal function treated with lisinopril alone for up to 24 weeks, the mean increase in serum potassium was approximately 0.1 mEq/L; however, approximately 15% of patients had increases greater than 0.5 mEq/L and approximately 6% had a decrease greater than 0.5 mEq/L. In the same study, patients treated with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide for up to 24 weeks had a mean decrease in serum potassium of 0.1 mEq/L; approximately 4% of patients had increases greater than 0.5 mEq/L and approximately 12% had a decrease greater than 0.5 mEq/L (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>). Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. </p>
<p>ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of lisinopril remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>While the mechanism through which lisinopril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, lisinopril is antihypertensive even in patients with low-renin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>. Although lisinopril was antihypertensive in all races studied, Black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to monotherapy than non-Black patients.</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide further reduced blood pressure in Black and non-Black patients and any racial differences in blood pressure response were no longer evident.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Following oral administration of lisinopril, peak serum concentrations of lisinopril occur within about 7 hours, although there was a trend to a small delay in time taken to reach peak serum concentrations in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">acute myocardial infarction</span> patients. Declining serum concentrations exhibit a prolonged terminal phase which does not contribute to drug accumulation. This terminal phase probably represents saturable binding to ACE and is not proportional to dose.</p>
<p>Lisinopril does not appear to be bound to other serum proteins. Lisinopril does not undergo metabolism and is excreted unchanged entirely in the urine. Based on urinary recovery, the mean extent of absorption of lisinopril is approximately 25%, with large intersubject variability (6 to 60%) at all doses tested (5 to 80 mg). Lisinopril absorption is not influenced by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract. The absolute bioavailability of lisinopril is reduced to 16% in patients with stable NYHA Class II-IV <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>, and the volume of distribution appears to be slightly smaller than that in normal subjects. The oral bioavailability of lisinopril in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">acute myocardial infarction</span> is similar to that in healthy volunteers.</p>
<p>Upon multiple dosing, lisinopril exhibits an effective half-life of accumulation of 12 hours.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Impaired renal function</span> decreases elimination of lisinopril, which is excreted principally through the kidneys, but this decrease becomes clinically important only when the glomerular filtration rate is below 30 mL/min. Above this glomerular filtration rate, the elimination half-life is little changed. With greater impairment, however, peak and trough lisinopril levels increase, time to peak concentration increases and time to attain steady state is prolonged. Older patients, on average, have (approximately doubled) higher blood levels and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) than younger patients (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>). Lisinopril can be removed by hemodialysis.</p>
<p>Studies in rats indicate that lisinopril crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly. Multiple doses of lisinopril in rats do not result in accumulation in any tissues. Milk of lactating rats contains radioactivity following administration of <span class="Sup">14</span>C lisinopril. By whole body autoradiography, radioactivity was found in the placenta following administration of labeled drug to pregnant rats, but none was found in the fetuses.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of lisinopril were studied in 29 pediatric hypertensive patients between 6 years and 16 years with glomerular filtration rate &gt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>. After doses of 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg, steady state peak plasma concentrations of lisinopril occurred within 6 hours and the extent of absorption based on urinary recovery was about 28%. These values are similar to those obtained previously in adults. The typical value of lisinopril oral clearance (systemic clearance/absolute bioavailability) in a child weighing 30 kg is 10 L/h, which increases in proportion to renal function.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Adult Patients</span></p>
<p>Administration of lisinopril to patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>. Symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span> is usually not observed although it can occur and should be anticipated in volume and/or salt-depleted patients (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>). When given together with thiazide-type diuretics, the blood pressure lowering effects of the two drugs are approximately additive.</p>
<p>In most patients studied, onset of antihypertensive activity was seen at one hour after oral administration of an individual dose of lisinopril, with peak reduction of blood pressure achieved by 6 hours. Although an antihypertensive effect was observed 24 hours after dosing with recommended single daily doses, the effect was more consistent and the mean effect was considerably larger in some studies with doses of 20 mg or more than with lower doses. However, at all doses studied, the mean antihypertensive effect was substantially smaller 24 hours after dosing than it was 6 hours after dosing.</p>
<p>In some patients, achievement of optimal blood pressure reduction may require two to four weeks of therapy. </p>
<p>The antihypertensive effects of lisinopril are maintained during long-term therapy. Abrupt withdrawal of lisinopril has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure, or a significant increase in blood pressure compared to pretreatment levels.</p>
<p>Two dose-response studies utilizing a once-daily regimen were conducted in 438 mild to moderate hypertensive patients not on a diuretic. Blood pressure was measured 24 hours after dosing. An antihypertensive effect of lisinopril was seen with 5 mg in some patients. However, in both studies blood pressure reduction occurred sooner and was greater in patients treated with 10, 20, or 80 mg of lisinopril. In controlled clinical studies, lisinopril 20 to 80 mg has been compared in patients with mild to moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> to hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 50 mg and with atenolol 50 to 200 mg; and in patients with moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> to metoprolol 100 to 200 mg. It was superior to hydrochlorothiazide in effects on systolic and diastolic pressure in a population that was <span class="Sup">3</span>/<span class="Sub">4</span> Caucasian. Lisinopril was approximately equivalent to atenolol and metoprolol in effects on diastolic blood pressure, and had somewhat greater effects on systolic blood pressure. </p>
<p>Lisinopril had similar effectiveness and adverse effects in younger and older (&gt; 65 years) patients. It was less effective in Blacks than in Caucasians.</p>
<p>In hemodynamic studies in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320128" conceptname="Essential hypertension">essential hypertension</span>, blood pressure reduction was accompanied by a reduction in peripheral arterial resistance with little or no change in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span> and in heart rate. In a study in nine hypertensive patients, following administration of lisinopril, there was an increase in mean renal blood flow that was not significant. Data from several small studies are inconsistent with respect to the effect of lisinopril on glomerular filtration rate in hypertensive patients with normal renal function, but suggest that changes, if any, are not large.</p>
<p>In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317895" conceptname="Renovascular hypertension">renovascular hypertension</span> lisinopril has been shown to be well tolerated and effective in controlling blood pressure (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>).</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients</span></p>
<p>In a clinical study involving 115 hypertensive pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age, patients who weighed &lt; 50 kg received either 0.625, 2.5, or 20 mg of lisinopril daily and patients who weighed ≥ 50 kg received either 1.25, 5, or 40 mg of lisinopril daily. At the end of 2 weeks, lisinopril administered once daily lowered trough blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner with consistent antihypertensive efficacy demonstrated at doses &gt; 1.25 mg (0.02 mg/kg). This effect was confirmed in a withdrawal phase, where the diastolic pressure rose by about 9 mmHg more in patients randomized to placebo than it did in patients who were randomized to remain on the middle and high doses of lisinopril. The dose-dependent antihypertensive effect of lisinopril was consistent across several demographic subgroups: age, Tanner stage, gender, and race. In this study, lisinopril was generally well-tolerated.</p>
<p>In the above pediatric studies, lisinopril was given either as tablets or in a suspension for those children and infants who were unable to swallow tablets or who required a lower dose than is available in tablet form (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>, <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Preparation of Suspension (for 200 mL of a 1 mg/mL Suspension)</span></span>).</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>During baseline-controlled clinical trials, in patients receiving digitalis and diuretics, single doses of lisinopril resulted in decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span> and blood pressure accompanied by an increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span> and no change in heart rate.</p>
<p>In two placebo controlled, 12 week clinical studies using doses of lisinopril up to 20 mg, lisinopril as adjunctive therapy to digitalis and diuretics improved the following signs and symptoms due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4167669" conceptname="Respiratory crackles">rales</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4206307" conceptname="Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea">paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea</span> and jugular venous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218984" conceptname="Abdominal distension">distention</span>. In one of the studies, beneficial response was also noted for: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315361" conceptname="Orthopnea">orthopnea</span>, presence of third heart sound and the number of patients classified as NYHA Class III and IV. Exercise tolerance was also improved in this study. The once-daily dosing for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span> was the only dosage regimen used during clinical trial development and was determined by the measurement of hemodynamic response. A large (over 3000 patients) survival study, the ATLAS Trial, comparing 2.5 and 35 mg of lisinopril in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, showed that the higher dose of lisinopril had outcomes at least as favorable as the lower dose.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvienza nell’Infarto Miocardico (GISSI-3) study was a multicenter, controlled, randomized, unblinded clinical trial conducted in 19,394 patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">acute myocardial infarction</span> admitted to a coronary care unit. It was designed to examine the effects of short-term (6 week) treatment with lisinopril, nitrates, their combination, or no therapy on short-term (6 week) mortality and on long-term <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> and markedly impaired cardiac function. Patients presenting within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms who were hemodynamically stable were randomized, in a 2 x 2 factorial design, to six weeks of either 1) lisinopril alone (n = 4841), 2) nitrates alone (n = 4869), 3) lisinopril plus nitrates (n = 4841), or 4) open control (n = 4843). All patients received routine therapies, including thrombolytics (72%), aspirin (84%), and a beta-blocker (31%), as appropriate, normally utilized in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">acute myocardial infarction</span> (MI) patients.</p>
<p>The protocol excluded patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> (systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mmHg), severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198571" conceptname="Cardiogenic shock">cardiogenic shock</span>, and renal dysfunction (serum creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dL and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75650" conceptname="Proteinuria">proteinuria</span> &gt; 500 mg/24 h). Doses of lisinopril were adjusted as necessary according to protocol (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND </span><span class="Bold">ADMINISTRATION</span>). </p>
<p>Study treatment was withdrawn at six weeks except where clinical conditions indicated continuation of treatment.</p>
<p>The primary outcomes of the trial were the overall mortality at 6 weeks and a combined endpoint at 6 months after the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, consisting of the number of patients who died, had late (day 4) clinical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>, or had extensive left ventricular damage defined as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4108582" conceptname="Left ventricular ejection fraction">ejection fraction</span> ≤ 35% or an akinetic-dyskinetic [A-D] score ≥ 45%. Patients receiving lisinopril (n = 9646), alone or with nitrates, had an 11% lower risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> (2p [two-tailed] = 0.04) compared to patients receiving no lisinopril (n = 9672) (6.4% vs. 7.2%, respectively) at six weeks. Although patients randomized to receive lisinopril for up to six weeks also fared numerically better on the combined endpoint at 6 months, the open nature of the assessment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, substantial loss to follow-up echocardiography, and substantial excess use of lisinopril between 6 weeks and 6 months in the group randomized to 6 weeks of lisinopril, preclude any conclusion about this endpoint.</p>
<p>Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">acute myocardial infarction</span>, treated with lisinopril, had a higher (9% vs. 3.7%) incidence of persistent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> (systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg for more than 1 hour) and renal dysfunction (2.4% vs. 1.1%) in-hospital and at six weeks (increasing creatinine concentration to over 3 mg/dL or a doubling or more of the baseline serum creatinine concentration) (see <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">Acute Myocardial Infarction</span></span>).</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS &amp; USAGE</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Lisinopril tablets USP are indicated for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">strokes</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarctions</span>. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including lisinopril. </p>
<p>Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).</p>
<p>Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, but reductions in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.</p>
<p>Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> (for example, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432867" conceptname="Hyperlipidemia">hyperlipidemia</span>), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. </p>
<p>Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in Black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.</p>
<p>Lisinopril tablets USP may be administered alone or with other antihypertensive agents.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lisinopril tablets USP are indicated as adjunctive therapy in the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> in patients who are not responding adequately to diuretics and digitalis.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lisinopril tablets USP are indicated for the treatment of hemodynamically stable patients within 24 hours of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">acute myocardial infarction</span>, to improve survival. Patients should receive, as appropriate, the standard recommended treatments such as thrombolytics, aspirin and beta-blockers.</p>
<p>In using lisinopril tablets USP, consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440689" conceptname="Agranulocytosis">agranulocytosis</span>, particularly in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> or collagen vascular disease, and that available data are insufficient to show that lisinopril tablets USP do not have a similar risk (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p>
<p>In considering the use of lisinopril tablets USP, it should be noted that in controlled clinical trials, ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in Black patients than in non-Blacks. In addition, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a higher rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432791" conceptname="Angioedema">angioedema</span> in Black than in non-Black patients (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS, Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related </span><span class="Bold">Reactions</span>).</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including lisinopril) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432791" conceptname="Angioedema">Angioedema</span> of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or larynx has been reported in patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including lisinopril. This may occur at any time during treatment. ACE inhibitors have been associated with a higher rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432791" conceptname="Angioedema">angioedema</span> in Black than in non-Black patients. Lisinopril should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and monitoring should be provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and symptoms has occurred.

The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432791" conceptname="Angioedema">angioedema</span> was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor.

<p>Excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> is rare in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4269635" conceptname="Hypertensive episode">uncomplicated hypertension</span> treated with lisinopril alone.</p>
<p>Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> given lisinopril commonly have some reduction in blood pressure, with peak blood pressure reduction occurring 6 to 8 hours post dose. Evidence from the two-dose ATLAS trial suggested that incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> may increase with dose of lisinopril in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> patients. Discontinuation of therapy because of continuing symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> usually is not necessary when dosing instructions are followed; caution should be observed when initiating therapy (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>). </p>

It may be advisable to eliminate the diuretic (except in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>), reduce the diuretic dose or increase salt intake cautiously before initiating therapy with lisinopril in patients at risk for excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> who are able to tolerate such adjustments (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</span>, and <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>). </p>
<p>Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">acute myocardial infarction</span> in the GISSI-3 trial had a higher (9% vs. 3.7%) incidence of persistent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> (systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg for more than 1 hour) when treated with lisinopril. Treatment with lisinopril must not be initiated in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">acute myocardial infarction</span> patients at risk of further serious hemodynamic deterioration after treatment with a vasodilator (e.g., systolic blood pressure of 100 mmHg or lower) or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198571" conceptname="Cardiogenic shock">cardiogenic shock</span>.</p>
<p>In patients at risk of excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, therapy should be started under very close medical supervision and such patients should be followed closely for the first two weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of lisinopril and/or diuretic is increased. Similar considerations may apply to patients with ischemic heart or cerebrovascular disease, or in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">acute myocardial infarction</span>, in whom an excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314171" conceptname="Low blood pressure reading">fall in blood pressure</span> could result in a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">cerebrovascular accident</span>.</p>
<p>If excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, receive an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further doses of lisinopril which usually can be given without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. If symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> develops, a dose reduction or discontinuation of lisinopril or concomitant diuretic may be necessary.</p>

<p>Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. Resulting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090272" conceptname="Anuria">anuria</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue lisinopril as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus. </p>
<p>In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> is observed, discontinue lisinopril, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of <span class="Italics">in utero</span> exposure to lisinopril for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306451" conceptname="Oliguria">oliguria</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span> (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>, <span class="Bold">Pediatric Use</span>).</p>
<p>No teratogenic effects of lisinopril were seen in studies of pregnant rats, mice, and rabbits. On a mg/kg basis, the doses used were up to 625 times (in mice), 188 times (in rats), and 0.6 times (in rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose.</p>

<p>As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span> whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including lisinopril, may be associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306451" conceptname="Oliguria">oliguria</span> and/or progressive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4261202" conceptname="Uremia">azotemia</span> and rarely with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.</p>
<p>In hypertensive patients with unilateral or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118795" conceptname="Renal artery stenosis">bilateral renal artery stenosis</span>, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur. Experience with another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor suggests that these increases are usually reversible upon discontinuation of lisinopril and/or diuretic therapy. In such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy.</p>
<p>Some patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> with no apparent preexisting renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when lisinopril has been given concomitantly with a diuretic.

In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">acute myocardial infarction</span>, treatment with lisinopril should be initiated with caution in patients with evidence of renal dysfunction, defined as serum creatinine concentration exceeding 2 mg/dL.

<p>Patients on diuretics and especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with lisinopril. The possibility of hypotensive effects with lisinopril can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with lisinopril. If it is necessary to continue the diuretic, initiate therapy with lisinopril at a dose of 5 mg daily, and provide close medical supervision after the initial dose until blood pressure has stabilized (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS </span>and <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>). When a diuretic is added to the therapy of a patient receiving lisinopril, an additional antihypertensive effect is usually observed. Studies with ACE inhibitors in combination with diuretics indicate that the dose of the ACE inhibitor can be reduced when it is given with a diuretic (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p>

<p>In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including lisinopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span>.

<p>Lisinopril has been used concomitantly with nitrates and/or digoxin without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions. This included post <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> patients who were receiving intravenous or transdermal nitroglycerin. No clinically important <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interactions</span> occurred when lisinopril was used concomitantly with propranolol or hydrochlorothiazide. The presence of food in the stomach does not alter the bioavailability of lisinopril.</p>

<p>Lisinopril attenuates potassium loss caused by thiazide-type diuretics. Use of lisinopril with potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, eplerenone, triamterene or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to significant increases in serum potassium. Therefore, if concomitant use of these agents is indicated because of demonstrated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>, they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium.

<p>There was no evidence of a tumorigenic effect when lisinopril was administered for 105 weeks to male and female rats at doses up to 90 mg/kg/day (about 56 or 9 times<span class="Sup">*</span> the maximum recommended daily human dose, based on body weight and body surface area, respectively). There was no evidence of carcinogenicity when lisinopril was administered for 92 weeks to (male and female) mice at doses up to 135 mg/kg/day (about 84 times<span class="Sup">*</span> the maximum recommended daily human dose). This dose was 6.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area in mice.</p>
<p>Lisinopril was not mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test with or without metabolic activation. It was also negative in a forward mutation assay using Chinese hamster lung cells. Lisinopril did not produce single strand DNA breaks in an <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>alkaline elution rat hepatocyte assay. In addition, lisinopril did not produce increases in chromosomal aberrations in an <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>test in Chinese hamster ovary cells or in an <span class="Italics">in vivo </span>study in mouse bone marrow. </p>
<p>There were no adverse effects on reproductive performance in male and female rats treated with up to 300 mg/kg/day of lisinopril. This dose is 188 times and 30 times the maximum human dose when based on mg/kg and mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, respectively.</p>

<p>Milk of lactating rats contains radioactivity following administration of <span class="Sup">14</span>C lisinopril. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from ACE inhibitors, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue lisinopril, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<p>Clinical studies of lisinopril in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other clinical experience in this population has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>
<p>In the ATLAS trial of lisinopril in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>, 1,596 (50%) were 65 and over, while 437 (14%) were 75 and over.

<p>Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p>

</p>
<p></p>
<p>In clinical trials in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> treated with lisinopril, discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse experiences occurred in 5.7% of patients. The overall frequency of adverse experiences could not be related to total daily dosage within the recommended therapeutic dosage range. </p>
<p>For adverse experiences occurring in greater than 1% of patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> treated with lisinopril or lisinopril plus hydrochlorothiazide in controlled clinical trials, and more frequently with lisinopril and/or lisinopril plus hydrochlorothiazide than placebo, comparative incidence data are listed in the table below:</p>

<h1>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>In patients with uncomplicated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320128" conceptname="Essential hypertension">essential hypertension</span> not on diuretic therapy, the recommended initial dose is 10 mg once a day. Dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure response. The usual dosage range is 20 to 40 mg per day administered in a single daily dose. The antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval regardless of the administered dose, but most commonly with a dose of 10 mg daily. This can be evaluated by measuring blood pressure just prior to dosing to determine whether satisfactory control is being maintained for 24 hours. If it is not, an increase in dose should be considered. Doses up to 80 mg have been used but do not appear to give greater effect. If blood pressure is not controlled with lisinopril tablets USP alone, a low dose of a diuretic may be added. Hydrochlorothiazide, 12.5 mg has been shown to provide an additive effect. After the addition of a diuretic, it may be possible to reduce the dose of lisinopril tablets USP.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>In hypertensive patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> may occur occasionally following the initial dose of lisinopril tablets USP. The diuretic should be discontinued, if possible, for two to three days before beginning therapy with lisinopril tablets USP to reduce the likelihood of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>). The dosage of lisinopril tablets USP should be adjusted according to blood pressure response. If the patient’s blood pressure is not controlled with lisinopril tablets USP alone, diuretic therapy may be resumed as described above. </p>
<p>If the diuretic cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 5 mg should be used under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS </span>and <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</span>).</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of lisinopril tablets USP with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes, or potassium-sparing diuretics may lead to increases of serum potassium (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>).</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The usual dose of lisinopril tablets USP (10 mg) is recommended for patients with creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/min (serum creatinine of up to approximately 3 mg/dL). For patients with creatinine clearance ≥ 10 mL/min ≤ 30 mL/min (serum creatinine ≥ 3 mg/dL), the first dose is 5 mg once daily. For patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 10 mL/min (usually on hemodialysis) the recommended initial dose is 2.5 mg. The dosage may be titrated upward until blood pressure is controlled or to a maximum of 40 mg daily.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Lisinopril tablets USP are indicated as adjunctive therapy with diuretics and (usually) digitalis. The recommended starting dose is 5 mg once a day. When initiating treatment with lisinopril, USP in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, the initial dose should be administered under medical observation, especially in those patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">low blood pressure</span> (systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg). The mean peak blood pressure lowering occurs six to eight hours after dosing. Observation should continue until blood pressure is stable. The concomitant diuretic dose should be reduced, if possible, to help minimize <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436375" conceptname="Hypovolemia">hypovolemia</span> which may contribute to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS </span>and <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</span>). The appearance of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> after the initial dose of lisinopril tablets USP does not preclude subsequent careful dose titration with the drug, following effective management of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>.</p>
<p>The usual effective dosage range is 5 to 40 mg per day administered as a single daily dose. The dose of lisinopril tablets USP can be increased by increments of no greater than 10 mg, at intervals of no less than 2 weeks to the highest tolerated dose, up to a maximum of 40 mg daily. Dose adjustment should be based on the clinical response of individual patients.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> who have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">hyponatremia</span> (serum sodium &lt; 130 mEq/L) or moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min or serum creatinine &gt; 3 mg/dL), therapy with lisinopril tablets USP should be initiated at a dose of 2.5 mg once a day under close medical supervision (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS </span>and <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</span>).</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>In hemodynamically stable patients within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">acute myocardial infarction</span>, the first dose of lisinopril tablets USP is 5 mg given orally, followed by 5 mg after 24 hours, 10 mg after 48 hours and then 10 mg of lisinopril tablets USP once daily. Dosing should continue for six weeks. Patients should receive, as appropriate, the standard recommended treatments such as thrombolytics, aspirin, and beta-blockers.</p>
<p>Patients with a low systolic blood pressure (≤ 120 mmHg) when treatment is started or during the first 3 days after the infarct should be given a lower 2.5 mg oral dose of lisinopril tablets USP (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>). If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> occurs (systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mmHg), a daily maintenance dose of 5 mg may be given with temporary reductions to 2.5 mg if needed. If prolonged <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> occurs (systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg for more than 1 hour) lisinopril tablets USP should be withdrawn. For patients who develop symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">Heart Failure</span></span>.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">acute myocardial infarction</span>, treatment with lisinopril tablets USP should be initiated with caution in patients with evidence of renal dysfunction, defined as serum creatinine concentration exceeding 2 mg/dL. No evaluation of dosing adjustments in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> has been performed.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>In general, the clinical response was similar in younger and older patients given similar doses of lisinopril tablets USP. Pharmacokinetic studies, however, indicate that maximum blood levels and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) are doubled in older patients, so that dosage adjustments should be made with particular caution.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The usual recommended starting dose is 0.07 mg/kg once daily (up to 5 mg total). Dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure response. Doses above 0.61 mg/kg (or in excess of 40 mg) have not been studied in pediatric patients (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>, <span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span><span class="Bold">and</span><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span> and <span class="Bold">Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects</span>).</p>
<p>Lisinopril tablets USP are not recommended in pediatric patients &lt; 6 years or in pediatric patients with glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span> (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics and </span><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span> and <span class="Bold">Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects</span> and <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>).</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Add 10 mL of Purified Water USP to a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottle containing ten 20 mg tablets of lisinopril tablets USP and shake for at least one minute. Add 30 mL of Bicitra<span class="Sup">®</span>  diluent and 160 mL of Ora-Sweet SF™   to the concentrate in the PET bottle and gently shake for several seconds to disperse the ingredients. The suspension should be stored at or below 25°C (77°F) and can be stored for up to four weeks. Shake the suspension before each use.</p>
