<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Captopril tablets, USP are a specific competitive inhibitor of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), the enzyme responsible for the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.</p>
<p>Captopril is designated chemically as 1-[(2S)-3-mercapto-2-methylpropionyl]-L-proline. Molecular formula C<span class="Sub">9</span>H<span class="Sub">15</span>NO<span class="Sub">3</span>S [MW 217.29] and has the following structural formula:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="Structure" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=851ff660-e6a4-48f8-a6d0-4c10dbb01836&amp;name=851ff660-e6a4-48f8-a6d0-4c10dbb01836-01.jpg"></div>
<p>Captopril is a white to off-white crystalline powder that may have a slight sulfurous odor; it is soluble in water (approx. 160 mg/mL), methanol, and ethanol and sparingly soluble in chloroform and ethyl acetate.</p>
<p>Each scored tablet, for oral administration, contains 12.5 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg or 100 mg of captopril. In addition, each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: microcrystalline cellulose, corn starch, anhydrous lactose, colloidal silicon dioxide, talc and palmitic acid.</p>

<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">The mechanism of action of captopril has not yet been fully elucidated. Its beneficial effects in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> appear to result primarily from suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. However, there is no consistent correlation between renin levels and response to the drug. Renin, an enzyme synthesized by the kidneys, is released into the circulation where it acts on a plasma globulin substrate to produce angiotensin I, a relatively inactive decapeptide. Angiotensin I is then converted by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to angiotensin II, a potent endogenous vasoconstrictor substance. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex, thereby contributing to sodium and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4125002" conceptname="Idiopathic fluid retention">fluid retention</span>.</p>
<p>Captopril prevents the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II by inhibition of ACE, a peptidyldipeptide carboxy hydrolase. This inhibition has been demonstrated in both healthy human subjects and in animals by showing that the elevation of blood pressure caused by exogenously administered angiotensin I was attenuated or abolished by captopril. In animal studies, captopril did not alter the pressor responses to a number of other agents, including angiotensin II and norepinephrine, indicating specificity of action.</p>
<p>ACE is identical to "bradykininase", and captopril may also interfere with the degradation of the vasodepressor peptide, bradykinin. Increased concentrations of bradykinin or prostaglandin E<span class="Sub">2</span> may also have a role in the therapeutic effect of Captopril.</p>
<p>Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II and increased plasma renin activity (PRA), the latter resulting from loss of negative feedback on rennin release caused by reduction in angiotensin II. The reduction of angiotensin II leads to decreased aldosterone secretion, and, as a result, small increases in serum potassium may occur along with sodium and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435796" conceptname="Dehydration">fluid loss</span>. The antihypertensive effects persist for a longer period of time than does demonstrable inhibition of circulating ACE. It is not known whether the ACE present in vascular endothelium is inhibited longer than the ACE in circulating blood.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">After oral administration of therapeutic doses of captopril, rapid absorption occurs with peak blood levels at about one hour. The presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract reduces absorption by about 30 to 40 percent; captopril therefore should be given one hour before meals. Based on carbon-14 labeling, average minimal absorption is approximately 75 percent. In a 24-hour period, over 95 percent of the absorbed dose is eliminated in the urine; 40 to 50 percent is unchanged drug; most of the remainder is the disulfide dimer of captopril and captopril-cysteine disulfide. </p>
<p>Approximately 25 to 30 percent of the circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins. The apparent elimination half-life for total radioactivity in blood is probably less than 3 hours. An accurate determination of half-life of unchanged captopril is not, at present, possible, but it is probably less than 2 hours. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, however, retention of captopril occurs (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_fbdf2fb8-a253-4cdd-8526-94478f44a3cf">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).</span></p>

<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">Administration of captopril results in a reduction of peripheral arterial resistance in hypertensive patients with either no change, or an increase, in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span>. There is an increase in renal blood flow following administration of captopril and glomerular filtration rate is usually unchanged.</p>
<p>Reductions of blood pressure are usually maximal 60 to 90 minutes after oral administration of an individual dose of captopril. The duration of effect is dose related. The reduction in blood pressure may be progressive, so to achieve maximal therapeutic effects, several weeks of therapy may be required. The blood pressure lowering effects of captopril and thiazide-type diuretics are additive. In contrast, captopril and beta-blockers have a less than additive effect.</p>
<p>Blood pressure is lowered to about the same extent in both standing and supine positions. Orthostatic effects and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span> are infrequent but may occur in volumedepleted patients. Abrupt withdrawal of captopril has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure.</p>
<p>In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, significantly decreased peripheral (systemic vascular) resistance and blood pressure (afterload), reduced pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload) and pulmonary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span>, increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span>, and increased exercise tolerance time (ETT) have been demonstrated. These hemodynamic and clinical effects occur after the first dose and appear to persist for the duration of therapy. Placebo controlled studies of 12 weeks duration in patients who did not respond adequately to diuretics and digitalis show no tolerance to beneficial effects on ETT; open studies, with exposure up to 18 months in some cases, also indicate that ETT benefit is maintained. Clinical improvement has been observed in some patients where acute hemodynamic effects were minimal.</p>
<p>The Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 2,231 patients (age 21-79 years) who survived the acute phase of a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> and did not have active <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4200991" conceptname="Ischemia">ischemia</span>. Patients had <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047088" conceptname="Left ventricular systolic dysfunction">left ventricular dysfunction</span> (LVD), defined as a resting left ventricular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4108582" conceptname="Left ventricular ejection fraction">ejection fraction</span> ≤40%, but at the time of randomization were not sufficiently symptomatic to require ACE inhibitor therapy for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>. About half of the patients had symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> in the past. Patients were given a test dose of 6.25 mg oral captopril tablets and were randomized within 3-16 days post <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4206471" conceptname="Infarct">infarction</span> to receive either captopril tablets or placebo in addition to conventional therapy. Captopril tablets were initiated at 6.25 mg or 12.5 mg t.i.d. and after two weeks titrated to a target maintenance dose of 50 mg t.i.d. About 80% of patients were receiving the target dose at the end of the study. Patients were followed for a minimum of two years and for up to five years, with an average follow-up of 3.5 years.</p>
<p>Baseline blood pressure was 113/70 mmHg and 112/70 mmHg for the placebo and captopril tablets groups, respectively. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="141693" conceptname="Elevated blood-pressure reading without diagnosis of hypertension">Blood pressure increased</span> slightly in both treatment groups during the study and was somewhat lower in the captopril tablets group (119/74 Vs. 125/77 mmHg at 1 yr).</p>
<p>Therapy with captopril tablets improved long-term survival and clinical outcomes compared to placebo. The risk reduction for all cause mortality was 19% (P=0.02) and for cardiovascular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> was 21% (P=0.014). Captopril treated subjects had 22% (P=0.034) fewer first hospitalizations for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>. Compared to placebo, 22% fewer patients receiving captopril developed symptoms of overt <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>. There was no significant difference between groups in total hospitalizations for all cause (2056 placebo; 2036 captopril).</p>
<p>Captopril tablets were well tolerated in the presence of other therapies such as aspirin, beta blockers, nitrates, vasodilators, calcium antagonists and diuretics.</p>
<p>In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo controlled trial, 409 patients, age 18-49 of either gender, with or without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, with type I (juvenile type, onset before age 30) insulin-dependent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="376103" conceptname="Retinopathy">retinopathy</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75650" conceptname="Proteinuria">proteinuria</span> ≥500 mg per day and serum creatinine ≤ 2.5 mg/dL, were randomized to placebo or captopril tablets (25 mg t.i.d.) and followed for up to 4.8 years (median 3 years). To achieve blood pressure control, additional antihypertensive agents (diuretics, beta blockers, centrally acting agents or vasodilators) were added as needed for patients in both groups.</p>
<p>The captopril tablets group had a 51% reduction in risk of doubling of serum creatinine (P&lt;0.01) and a 51% reduction in risk for the combined endpoint of end-stage <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span> (dialysis or transplantation) or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> (P&lt;0.01). Captopril tablets treatment resulted in a 30% reduction in urine prote in excretion within the first 3 months (P&lt;0.05), which was maintained throughout the trial. The captopril tablets group had somewhat better blood pressure control than the placebo group, but the effects of captopril tablet on renal function were greater than would be expected from the group differences in blood pressure reduction alone. Captopril tablets were well tolerated in this patient population.</p>
<p>In two multicenter, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, a total of 235 normotensive patients with insulin-dependent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="376103" conceptname="Retinopathy">retinopathy</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4195061" conceptname="Microalbuminuria">microalbuminuria</span> (20-200 mcg/min) were randomized to placebo or Captopril tablets (50 mg b.i.d.) and followed for up to 2 years. Captopril tablets delayed the progression to overt <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">nephropathy</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75650" conceptname="Proteinuria">proteinuria</span> ≥500 mg/day) in both studies (risk reduction 67% to 76%; P&lt;0.05). Captopril tablets also reduced the albumin excretion rate. However, the long term clinical benefit of reducing the progression from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4195061" conceptname="Microalbuminuria">microalbuminuria</span> to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75650" conceptname="Proteinuria">proteinuria</span> has not been established.</p>
<p>Studies in rats and cats indicate that captopril does not cross the blood-brain barrier to any significant extent.</p>

<p>Captopril may be used as initial therapy for patients with normal renal function, in whom the risk is relatively low. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>, particularly those with collagen vascular disease, captopril should be reserved for hypertensives who have either developed unacceptable side effects on other drugs, or have failed to respond satisfactorily to drug combinations.</p>
<p>Captopril is effective alone and in combination with other antihypertensive agents, especially thiazide-type diuretics. The blood pressure lowering effects of captopril and thiazides are approximately additive.</p>

<p>The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span> is dependent on the clinical status of the patient:</p>

Daily doses of captopril were relatively high in these patients, particularly in view of their diminished renal function.

<p>The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span> has usually been detected within three months after captopril was started. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4043761" conceptname="Bone marrow examination">Bone marrow examinations</span> in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span> consistently showed myeloid hypoplasia, frequently accompanied by erythroid hypoplasia and decreased numbers of megakaryocytes (e.g., hypoplastic bone marrow and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432881" conceptname="Pancytopenia">pancytopenia</span>); <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span> were sometimes seen.</p>
<p>In general, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4148615" conceptname="Neutrophil count">neutrophils</span> returned to normal in about two weeks after captopril was discontinued, and serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> were limited to clinically complex patients. About 13 percent of the cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span> have ended fatally, but almost all fatalities were in patients with serious illness, having collagen vascular disease, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> or immunosuppressant therapy, or a combination of these complicating factors.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Evaluation of the hypertensive or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> patient should always include assessment of renal function.</span></p>
<p>If captopril is used in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>, white blood cell and differential counts should be evaluated prior to starting treatment and at approximately two-week intervals for about three months, then periodically.</p>

<h2>Fetal Toxicity</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category D</span></p>
<p>Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. Resulting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090272" conceptname="Anuria">anuria</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue captopril as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mothers and fetus. </p>
<p>In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> is observed, discontinue captopril, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of <span class="Italics">in utero </span>exposure to captopril for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306451" conceptname="Oliguria">oliguria</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span>.

<p>When captopril was given to rabbits at doses about 0.8 to 70 times (on a mg/kg basis) the maximum recommended human dose, low incidences of craniofacial malformations were seen. No teratogenic effects of captopril were seen in studies of pregnant rats and hamsters.

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase - 2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) </span></p>
<p>In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including captopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span>. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving captopril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including captopril, may be attenuated by NSAIDs.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> - Patients on Diuretic Therapy: </span>Patients on diuretics and especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, as well as those on severe dietary salt restriction or dialysis, may occasionally experience a precipitous reduction of blood pressure usually within the first hour after receiving the initial dose of captopril.</p>
<p>The possibility of hypotensive effects with captopril can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake approximately one week prior to initiation of treatment with captopril tablets, USP or initiating therapy with small doses (6.25 or 12.5 mg). Alternatively, provide medical supervision for at least one hour after the initial dose. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position and, if necessary, receive an intravenous infusion of normal saline. This transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further doses which can be given without difficulty once the blood pressure has increased after volume expansion.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Agents Having Vasodilator Activity: </span>Data on the effect of concomitant use of other vasodilators in patients receiving captopril for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> are not available; therefore, nitroglycerin or other nitrates (as used for management of angina) or other drugs having vasodilator activity should, if possible, be discontinued before starting captopril. If resumed during captopril tablet therapy, such agents should be administered cautiously, and perhaps at lower dosage.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Agents Causing Renin Release: </span>Captopril's effect will be augmented by antihypertensive agents that cause renin release. For example, diuretics (e.g., thiazides) may activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Agents Affecting Sympathetic Activity: </span>The sympathetic nervous system may be especially important in supporting blood pressure in patients receiving captopril alone or with diuretics. Therefore, agents affecting sympathetic activity (e.g., ganglionic blocking agents or adrenergic neuron blocking agents) should be used with caution. Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs add some further antihypertensive effect to captopril, but the overall response is less than additive.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Agents Increasing Serum Potassium: </span>Since captopril decreases aldosterone production, elevation of serum potassium may occur. Potassium-sparing diuretics such as spironolactone, triamterene, or amiloride, or potassium supplements should be given only for documented <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>, and then with caution, since they may lead to a significant increase of serum potassium. Salt substitutes containing potassium should also be used with caution.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Lithium: </span>Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium toxicity</span> have been reported in patients receiving concomitant lithium and ACE inhibitor therapy. These drugs should be coadministered with caution and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, it may increase the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium toxicity</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Cardiac Glycosides: </span>In a study of young healthy male subjects no evidence of a direct pharmacokinetic captopril-digoxin interaction could be found.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Loop Diuretics: </span>Furosemide administered concurrently with captopril does not alter the pharmacokinetics of captopril in renally impaired hypertensive patients.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Allopurinol: </span>In a study of healthy male volunteers no significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interaction</span> occured when captopril and allopurinol were administered concomitantly for 6 days.</p>

<h2>Animal Toxicology</h2>
<p class="First">Chronic oral toxicity studies were conducted in rats (2 years), dogs (47 weeks; 1 year), mice (2 years), and monkeys (1 year). Significant drug-related toxicity included effects on hematopoiesis, renal toxicity, erosion/ulceration of the stomach and variation of retinal blood vessels.</p>
<p>Reductions in hemoglobin and/or hematocrit values were seen in mice, rats and monkeys at doses 50 to 150 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 450 mg, assuming a 50-kg subject. On a body-surface-area basis, these doses are 5 to 25 times maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">Anemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435224" conceptname="Leukopenia">leukopenia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span>, and bone marrow suppression occurred in dogs at doses 8 to 30 times MRHD on a body-weight basis (4 to 15 times MRHD on a surface-area basis). The reductions in hemoglobin and hematocrit values in rats and mice were only significant at 1 year and returned to normal with continued dosing by the end of the study. Marked <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span> was seen at all dose levels (8 to 30 times MRHD) in dogs, whereas moderate to marked <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435224" conceptname="Leukopenia">leukopenia</span> was noted only at 15 and 30 times MRHD and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span> at 30 times MRHD. The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span> could be reversed upon discontinuation of dosing. Bone marrow suppression occurred to a varying degree, being associated only with dogs that died or were sacrificed in a moribund condition in the 1 year study. However, in the 47-week study at a dose 30 times MRHD, bone marrow suppression was found to be reversible upon continued drug administration.</p>
<p>Captopril caused <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4296894" conceptname="Hyperplasia">hyperplasia</span> of the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidneys in mice and rats at doses 7 to 200 times MRHD on a body-weight basis (0.6 to 35 times MRHD on a surface-area basis); in monkeys at 20 to 60 times MRHD on a body-weight basis (7 to 20 times MRHD on a surface-area basis); and in dogs at 30 times MRHD on a body-weight basis (15 times MRHD on a surface-area basis).</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4341235" conceptname="Multiple gastric erosions">Gastric erosions</span>/ulcerations were increased in incidence in male rats at 20 to 200 times MRHD on a body-weight basis (3.5 and 35 times MRHD on a surface-area basis); in dogs at 30 times MRHD on a body-weight basis (15 times on MRHD on a surface-area basis); and in monkeys at 65 times MRHD on a body-weight basis (20 times MRHD on a surface-area basis). Rabbits developed gastric and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="195002" conceptname="Ulceration of intestine">intestinal ulcers</span> when given oral doses approximately 30 times MRHD on a body-weight basis (10 times MRHD on a surface-area basis) for only 5 to 7 days.</p>
<p>In the two-year rat study, irreversible and progressive variations in the caliber of retinal vessels (focal sacculations and constrictions) occurred at all dose levels (7 to 200 times MRHD) on a body weight-basis; 1 to 35 times MRHD on a surface-area basis in a dose-related fashion. The effect was first observed in the 88th week of dosing, with a progressively increased incidence thereafter, even after cessation of dosing.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Concentrations of captopril in human milk are approximately one percent of those in maternal blood. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from captopril, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of captopril tablet to the mother.

While captopril may be removed from the adult circulation by hemodialysis, there is inadequate data concerning the effectiveness of hemodialysis for removing it from the circulation of neonates or children. Peritoneal dialysis is not effective for removing captopril; there is no information concerning exchange transfusion for removing captopril form the general circulation.</p>
<p>Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. There is limited experience reported in the literature with the use of captopril in the pediatric population; dosage, on a weight basis, was generally reported to be comparable to or less than that used in adults.</p>
<p>Infants, especially newborns, may be more susceptible to the adverse hemodynamic effects of captopril.

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Correction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> would be of primary concern. Volume expansion with an intravenous infusion of normal saline is the treatment of choice for restoration of blood pressure.</p>
<p>While captopril may be removed from the adult circulation by hemodialysis, there is inadequate data concerning the effectiveness of hemodialysis for removing it from the circulation of neonates or children. Peritoneal dialysis is not effective for removing captopril; there is no information concerning exchange transfusion for removing captopril from the general circulation.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Captopril tablets should be taken one hour before meals. Dosage must be individualized.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">Hypertension</span> : </span>Initiation of therapy requires consideration of recent antihypertensive drug treatment, the extent of blood pressure elevation, salt restriction, and other clinical circumstances. If possible, discontinue the patient's previous antihypertensive drug regimen for one week before starting captopril.</p>
<p>The initial dose of captopril tablets, USP is 25 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. If satisfactory reduction of blood pressure has not been achieved after one or two weeks, the dose may be increased to 50 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. Concomitant sodium restriction may be beneficial when captopril is used alone.</p>
<p>The dose of captopril in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> usually does not exceed 50 mg t.i.d. Therefore, if the blood pressure has not been satisfactorily controlled after one to two weeks at this dose, (and the patient is not already receiving a diuretic), a modest dose of thiazide-type diuretic (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide, 25 mg daily), should be added. The diuretic dose may be increased at one- to two-week intervals until its highest usual antihypertensive dose is reached.</p>
<p>If captopril is being started in a patient already receiving a diuretic, captopril therapy should be initiated under close medical supervision (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_warnings_id_ccf0ae00-942b-48c2-ab95-57dfce73e2f0">WARNINGS </a></span>and <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_interactions_id_735d840a-7956-45f5-bfbc-3ba306292189">PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions regarding <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span></a>), </span>with dosage and titration of captopril as noted above.</p>
<p>If further blood pressure reduction is required, the dose of captopril may be increased to 100 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. and then, if necessary, to 150 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d . (while continuing the diuretic). The usual dose range is 25 to 150 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. A maximum daily dose of 450 mg captopril should not be exceeded.</p>
<p>For patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> (e.g., accelerated or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4289933" conceptname="Malignant hypertension">malignant hypertension</span>), when temporary discontinuation of current antihypertensive therapy is not practical or desirable, or when prompt titration to more normotensive blood pressure levels is indicated, diuretic should be continued but other current antihypertensive medication stopped and captopril dosage promptly initiated at 25 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d., under close medical supervision.</p>
<p>When necessitated by the patient's clinical condition, the daily dose of captopril may be increased every 24 hours or less under continuous medical supervision until a satisfactory blood pressure response is obtained or the maximum dose of captopril is reached. In this regimen, addition of a more potent diuretic, e.g., furosemide, may also be indicated.</p>
<p>Beta-blockers may also be used in conjunction with captopril therapy (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_interactions_id_735d840a-7956-45f5-bfbc-3ba306292189">PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions</a>), </span>but the effects of the two drugs are less than additive.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">Heart Failure</span> : </span>Initiation of therapy requires consideration of recent diuretic therapy and the possibility of severe salt/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436375" conceptname="Hypovolemia">volume depletion</span>. In patients with either normal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">low blood pressure</span>, who have been vigorously treated with diuretics and who may be <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">hyponatremic</span> and/or hypovolemic, a starting dose of 6.25 or 12.5 mg t.i.d. may minimize the magnitude or duration of the hypotensive effect (see <a href="#i4i_section_id_ab2d09e6-01c6-434d-80d9-f01dfd52aa39">WARNINGS: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span></a>); for these patients, titration to the usual daily dosage can then occur within the next several days.</p>
<p>For most patients the usual initial daily dosage is 25 mg t.i.d. After a dose of 50 mg t.i.d. is reached, further increases in dosage should be delayed, where possible, for at least two weeks to determine if a satisfactory response occurs. Most patients studied have had a satisfactory clinical improvement at 50 or 100 mg t.i.d. A maximum daily dose of 450 mg of captopril should not be exceeded.</p>
<p>Captopril should generally be used in conjunction with a diuretic and digitalis.</p>
<p>Captopril therapy must be initiated under very close medical supervision.</p>

<p>Therapy may be initiated as early as three days following a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>. After a single dose of 6.25 mg, captopril tablets therapy should be initiated at 12.5 mg t.i.d. Captopril tablets should then be increased to 25 mg t.i.d. during the next several days and to a target dose of 50 mg t.i.d. over the next several weeks as tolerated (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_clinical_pharmacology_id_77f3cbe8-07e2-43b0-a5ac-5927bd8395dc">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>). </span></p>
<p>Captopril tablets may be used in patients treated with other post-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> therapies, e.g. thrombolytics, aspirin, beta blockers.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192279" conceptname="Diabetic renal disease">Diabetic Nephropathy</span>: </span>The recommended dose of captopril tablets for long term use to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192279" conceptname="Diabetic renal disease">diabetic nephropathy</span> is 25 mg t.i.d.</p>
<p>Other antihypertensives such as diuretics, beta blockers, centrally acting agents or vasodilators may be used in conjuction with captopril tablets if additional therapy is required to further lower blood pressure.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Dosage Adjustment in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal Impairment</span> </span>: Because captopril is excreted primarily by the kidneys, excretion rates are reduced in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>. These patients will take longer to reach steady-state captopril levels and will reach higher steady-state levels for a given daily dose than patients with normal renal function. Therefore, these patients may respond to smaller or less frequent doses.</p>
<p>Accordingly, for patients with significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, initial daily dosage of captopril should be reduced, and smaller increments utilized for titration, which should be quite slow (one- to two-week intervals). After the desired therapeutic effect has been achieved, the dose should be slowly back titrated to determine the minimal effective dose. When concomitant diuretic therapy is required, a loop diuretic (e.g., furosemide), rather than a thiazide diuretic, is preferred in patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>.
