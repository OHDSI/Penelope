<p><a name="p7941465"></a><span class="Underline">Recommended Dosage for Treatment of HIV-1:</span></p>
<p><a name="p7971465"></a>The recommended dosage of ritonavir is 600 mg twice daily by mouth to be taken with meals.  Use of a dose titration schedule may help to reduce treatment-emergent adverse events while maintaining appropriate ritonavir plasma levels.  Ritonavir should be started at no less than 300 mg twice daily and increased at 2 to 3 day intervals by 100 mg twice daily. The maximum dose of 600 mg twice daily should not be exceeded upon completion of the titration.</p>

<p><a name="p8051465"></a>Ritonavir should be used in combination with other antiretroviral agents <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration <a href="#section_2">(2)</a>]</span>.  The recommended dosage of ritonavir in children greater than 1 month is 350 to 400 mg per m<span class="Sup">2</span> twice daily by mouth to be taken with meals and should not exceed 600 mg twice daily.  Ritonavir should be started at 250 mg per m<span class="Sup">2</span> twice daily and increased at 2 to 3 day intervals by 50 mg per m<span class="Sup">2</span> twice daily.  If patients do not tolerate 400 mg per m<span class="Sup">2</span> twice daily due to adverse events, the highest tolerated dose may be used for maintenance therapy in combination with other antiretroviral agents, however, alternative therapy should be considered.  When possible, dose should be administered using a calibrated dosing syringe.</p>

<p><a name="p148591465"></a>When co-administering NORVIR with other protease inhibitors (atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, saquinavir, and tipranavir), see the full prescribing information for that protease inhibitor including important information for drug interactions.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><a name="p148911465"></a>Ritonavir has been found to be an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) and may increase plasma concentrations of agents that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A.  Agents that are extensively metabolized by CYP3A and have high first pass metabolism appear to be the most susceptible to large increases in AUC (greater than 3-fold) when co-administered with ritonavir.  Thus, co-administration of NORVIR with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events is contraindicated.  Co-administration with other CYP3A substrates may require a dose adjustment or additional monitoring as shown in Table 5.</p>
<p><a name="p148941465"></a>Ritonavir also inhibits CYP2D6 to a lesser extent.  Co-administration of substrates of CYP2D6 with ritonavir could result in increases (up to 2-fold) in the AUC of the other agent, possibly requiring a proportional dosage reduction.  Ritonavir also appears to induce CYP3A, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6 as well as other enzymes, including glucuronosyl transferase.</p>

<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p><a name="p202681465"></a>NORVIR (ritonavir) is an inhibitor of HIV protease with activity against the Human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433740" conceptname="Immunodeficiency disorder">Immunodeficiency</span> Virus (HIV).	</p>
<p><a name="p202711465"></a>Ritonavir is chemically designated as 10-Hydroxy-2-methyl-5-(1-methylethyl)-1- [2-(1-methylethyl)-4-thiazolyl]-3,6-dioxo-8,11-bis(phenylmethyl)-2,4,7,12- tetraazatridecan-13-oic acid, 5-thiazolylmethyl ester, [5S-(5R*,8R*,10R*,11R*)].  Its molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">37</span>H<span class="Sub">48</span>N<span class="Sub">6</span>O<span class="Sub">5</span>S<span class="Sub">2</span>, and its molecular weight is 720.95.  Ritonavir has the following structural formula:</p>
<p><img alt="MM2" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=624120b3-0a32-42a7-abfc-324e6b6c93df&amp;name=MM2.jpg"></p>
<p><a name="p204841465"></a>Ritonavir is a white-to-light-tan powder.  Ritonavir has a bitter metallic taste.  It is freely soluble in methanol and ethanol, soluble in isopropanol and practically insoluble in water.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>

<p><a name="p205051465"></a>Ritonavir is an antiviral drug <span class="Italics">[see Microbiology <a href="#section_12.4">(12.4)</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><a name="p205211465"></a>The pharmacokinetics of ritonavir have been studied in healthy volunteers and HIV-infected patients (CD<span class="Sub">4</span> greater than or equal to 50 cells per μL).  See Table 6 for ritonavir pharmacokinetic characteristics.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><a name="p10791924"></a><span class="Underline">Absorption</span></p>
<p><a name="p207421465"></a>The absolute bioavailability of ritonavir has not been determined.  After a 600 mg dose of oral solution, peak concentrations of ritonavir were achieved approximately 2 hours and 4 hours after dosing under fasting and non-fasting (514 KCal; 9% fat, 12% protein, and 79% carbohydrate) conditions, respectively.</p>
<p><a name="p207451465"></a>NORVIR tablets are not bioequivalent to NORVIR capsules. Under moderate fat conditions (857 kcal; 31% fat, 13% protein, 56% carbohydrates), when a single 100 mg NORVIR dose was administered as a tablet compared with a capsule, AUC<span class="Sub">(0- ∞)</span> met equivalence criteria but mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> was increased by 26% (92.8% confidence intervals: ↑15 -↑39%). </p>
<p><a name="p207561465"></a>No information is available comparing NORVIR tablets to NORVIR capsules under fasting conditions.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><a name="p34596524"></a><span class="Italics">Effect of Food on Oral Absorption</span></p>
<p><a name="p207671465"></a>When the oral solution was given under non-fasting conditions, peak ritonavir concentrations decreased 23% and the extent of absorption decreased 7% relative to fasting conditions.  Dilution of the oral solution, within one hour of administration, with 240 mL of chocolate milk, Advera<span class="Sup">®</span> or Ensure<span class="Sup">®</span> did not significantly affect the extent and rate of ritonavir absorption.  Administration of a single 600 mg dose oral solution under non-fasting conditions yielded mean ± SD areas under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUCs) of 129.0 ± 39.3 mg•h per mL.</p>
<p><a name="p207781465"></a>A food effect is observed for NORVIR tablets. Food decreased the bioavailability of the ritonavir tablets when a single 100 mg dose of NORVIR was administered.  Under high fat conditions (907 kcal; 52% fat, 15% protein, 33% carbohydrates), a 23% decrease in mean AUC(0-∞) [90% confidence intervals: ↓30%-↓15%], and a 23% decrease in mean C<span class="Sub">max </span> [90% confidence intervals: ↓34%-↓11%]) was observed relative to fasting conditions.   Under moderate fat conditions, a 21% decrease in mean AUC(0-∞) [90% confidence intervals: ↓28%-↓13%], and a 22% decrease in mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> [90% confidence intervals: ↓33%-↓9%]) was observed relative to fasting conditions. </p>
<p><a name="p209951465"></a>However, the type of meal administered did not change ritonavir tablet bioavailability when high fat was compared to moderate fat meals.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><a name="p34586724"></a><span class="Underline">Metabolism</span></p>
<p><a name="p210041465"></a>Nearly all of the plasma radioactivity after a single oral 600 mg dose of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-ritonavir oral solution (n = 5) was attributed to unchanged ritonavir.  Five ritonavir metabolites have been identified in human urine and feces.  The isopropylthiazole oxidation metabolite (M-2) is the major metabolite and has antiviral activity similar to that of parent drug; however, the concentrations of this metabolite in plasma are low.  <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies utilizing human liver microsomes have demonstrated that cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) is the major isoform involved in ritonavir metabolism, although CYP2D6 also contributes to the formation of M–2.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><a name="p19976824"></a><span class="Underline">Elimination</span></p>
<p><a name="p210211465"></a>In a study of five subjects receiving a 600 mg dose of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-ritonavir oral solution, 11.3 ± 2.8% of the dose was excreted into the urine, with 3.5 ± 1.8% of the dose excreted as unchanged parent drug.  In that study, 86.4 ± 2.9% of the dose was excreted in the feces with 33.8 ± 10.8% of the dose excreted as unchanged parent drug.  Upon multiple dosing, ritonavir accumulation is less than predicted from a single dose possibly due to a time and dose-related increase in clearance.</p>

Across dose groups, ritonavir steady-state oral clearance (CL/F/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) was approximately 1.5 to 1.7 times faster in pediatric patients than in adult subjects.

<p><a name="p34593624"></a><span class="Underline">Antiviral Activity  in Cell Culture</span></p>
<p><a name="p279301465"></a>The activity of ritonavir was assessed in acutely infected lymphoblastoid cell lines and in peripheral blood <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span>.  The concentration of drug that inhibits 50% (EC<span class="Sub">50</span>) value of viral replication ranged from 3.8 to 153 nM depending upon the HIV-1 isolate and the cells employed.  The average EC<span class="Sub">50</span> value for low passage clinical isolates was 22 nM (n = 13).  In MT<span class="Sub">4</span> cells, ritonavir demonstrated additive effects against HIV-1 in combination with either didanosine (ddI) or zidovudine (ZDV). Studies which measured cytotoxicity of ritonavir on several cell lines showed that greater than 20 µM was required to inhibit cellular growth by 50% resulting in a cell culture therapeutic index of at least 1000.</p>

<p><a name="p281601465"></a>HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to ritonavir have been selected in cell culture.  Genotypic analysis of these isolates showed mutations in the HIV-1 protease gene leading to amino acid substitutions I84V, V82F, A71V, and M46I.  Phenotypic (n = 18) and genotypic (n = 48) changes in HIV-1 isolates from selected patients treated with ritonavir were monitored in phase I/II trials over a period of 3 to 32 weeks.  Substitutions associated with the HIV–1 viral protease in isolates obtained from 43 patients appeared to occur in a stepwise and ordered fashion at positions V82A/F/T/S, I54V, A71V/T, and I36L, followed by combinations of substitutions at an additional 5 specific amino acid positions (M46I/L, K20R, I84V, L33F and L90M).  Of 18 patients for whom both phenotypic and genotypic analysis were performed on free virus isolated from plasma, 12 showed reduced susceptibility to ritonavir in cell culture.  All 18 patients possessed one or more substitutions in the viral protease gene.  The V82A/F substitution appeared to be necessary but not sufficient to confer phenotypic resistance.  Phenotypic resistance was defined as a greater than or equal to 5-fold decrease in viral sensitivity in cell culture from baseline.</p>

<p><a name="p281741465"></a>Among protease inhibitors variable cross-resistance has been recognized.  Serial HIV-1 isolates obtained from six patients during ritonavir therapy showed a decrease in ritonavir susceptibility in cell culture but did not demonstrate a concordant decrease in susceptibility to saquinavir in cell culture when compared to matched baseline isolates.  However, isolates from two of these patients demonstrated decreased susceptibility to indinavir in cell culture (8-fold).  Isolates from 5 patients were also tested for cross-resistance to amprenavir and nelfinavir; isolates from 3 patients had a decrease in susceptibility to nelfinavir (6- to 14-fold), and none to amprenavir.  Cross-resistance between ritonavir and reverse transcriptase inhibitors is unlikely because of the different enzyme targets involved.  One ZDV-resistant HIV-1 isolate tested in cell culture retained full susceptibility to ritonavir.</p>

<p><a name="p34064224"></a><span class="Underline">Carcinogenesis</span></p>
<p><a name="p281901465"></a>Carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats have been carried out on ritonavir.  In male mice, at levels of 50, 100 or 200 mg per kg per day, there was a dose dependent increase in the incidence of both <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> and combined <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> and carcinomas in the liver.  Based on AUC measurements, the exposure at the high dose was approximately 0.3-fold for males that of the exposure in humans with the recommended therapeutic dose (600 mg twice-daily).  There were no carcinogenic effects seen in females at the dosages tested.  The exposure at the high dose was approximately 0.6-fold for the females that of the exposure in humans.  In rats dosed at levels of 7, 15 or 30 mg per kg per day there were no carcinogenic effects.  In this study, the exposure at the high dose was approximately 6% that of the exposure in humans with the recommended therapeutic dose.

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p><a name="p284241465"></a>The activity of NORVIR as monotherapy or in combination with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors has been evaluated in 1446 patients enrolled in two double-blind, randomized trials.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><a name="p284321465"></a>Study 247 was a randomized, double-blind trial (with open-label follow-up) conducted in HIV-infected patients with at least nine months of prior antiretroviral therapy and baseline CD<span class="Sub">4</span> cell counts less than or equal to 100 cells per μL.  NORVIR 600 mg twice-daily or placebo was added to each patient's baseline antiretroviral therapy regimen, which could have consisted of up to two approved antiretroviral agents.  The study accrued 1,090 patients, with mean baseline CD<span class="Sub">4</span> cell count at study entry of 32 cells per μL.  After the clinical benefit of NORVIR therapy was demonstrated, all patients were eligible to switch to open-label NORVIR for the duration of the follow-up period.  Median duration of double-blind therapy with NORVIR and placebo was 6 months.  The median duration of follow-up through the end of the open-label phase was 13.5 months for patients randomized to NORVIR and 14 months for patients randomized to placebo.</p>
<p><a name="p284431465"></a>The cumulative incidence of clinical disease progression or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> during the double-blind phase of Study 247 was 26% for patients initially randomized to NORVIR compared to 42% for patients initially randomized to placebo.  This difference in rates was statistically significant.</p>
<p><a name="p34054124"></a>Cumulative mortality through the end of the open-label follow-up phase for patients enrolled in Study 247 was 18% (99/543) for patients initially randomized to NORVIR compared to 26% (142/547) for patients initially randomized to placebo.  This difference in rates was statistically significant.  However, since the analysis at the end of the open-label phase includes patients in the placebo arm who were switched from placebo to NORVIR therapy, the survival benefit of NORVIR cannot be precisely estimated. </p>
<p><a name="p41748124"></a>During the double-blind phase of Study 247, CD<span class="Sub">4</span> cell counts increases from baseline for patients randomized to NORVIR at Week 2 and Week 4 were observed.  From Week 4 and through Week 24, mean CD<span class="Sub">4</span> cell counts for patients randomized to NORVIR appeared to plateau.  In contrast, there was no apparent change in mean CD<span class="Sub">4</span> cell counts for patients randomized to placebo at any visit between baseline and Week 24 of the double-blind phase of Study 247.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><a name="p287071465"></a>In Study 245, 356 antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected patients (mean baseline CD<span class="Sub">4</span> = 364 cells per μL) were randomized to receive either NORVIR 600 mg twice-daily, zidovudine 200 mg three-times-daily, or a combination of these drugs.</p>
<p><a name="p34049824"></a>During the double-blind phase of study 245, greater mean CD<span class="Sub">4</span> cell count increases were observed from baseline to Week 12 in the NORVIR-containing arms compared to the zidovudine arms.  Mean CD<span class="Sub">4</span> cell count changes subsequently appeared to plateau through Week 24 in the NORVIR arm, whereas mean CD<span class="Sub">4</span> cell counts gradually diminished through Week 24 in the zidovudine and NORVIR plus zidovudine arms. </p>
<p><a name="p42020724"></a>Greater mean reductions in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels were observed from baseline to Week 2 for the NORVIR-containing arms compared to the zidovudine arm.  After Week 2 and through Week 24, mean plasma HIV-1 RNA levels either remained stable in the NORVIR and zidovudine arms or gradually rebounded toward baseline in the NORVIR plus zidovudine arm.</p>

<p><a name="p302291465"></a>NORVIR is a prescription anti-HIV medicine used with other anti-HIV medicines to treat people with human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433740" conceptname="Immunodeficiency disorder">immunodeficiency</span> virus (HIV) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>.
