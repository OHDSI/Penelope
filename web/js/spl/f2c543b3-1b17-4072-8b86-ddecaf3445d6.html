<h1><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION
</span></h1>
<p class="First">Folic acid, N-[<span class="Italics">p</span>-[[(2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-pteridinyl) methyl]-amino]benzoyl]-L-glutamic acid, is a B complex vitamin containing a pteridine moiety linked by a methylene bridge to para-aminobenzoic acid, which is joined by a peptide linkage to glutamic acid. Conjugates of folic acid are present in a wide variety of foods, particularly liver, kidneys, yeast, and leafy green vegetables. Commercially available folic acid is prepared synthetically. Folic acid occurs as a yellow or yellowish-orange crystalline powder and is very slightly soluble in water and insoluble in alcohol. Folic acid is readily soluble in dilute solutions of alkali hydroxides and carbonates, and solutions of the drug may be prepared with the aid of sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate, thereby forming the soluble sodium salt of folic acid (sodium folate). Aqueous solutions of folic acid are heat sensitive and rapidly decompose in the presence of light and/or riboflavin; solutions should be stored in a cool place protected from light.</p>
<p>The structural formula of folic acid is as follows:</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</span></h1>
<p class="First">Folic acid acts on megaloblastic bone marrow to produce a normoblastic marrow.</p>
<p>In man, an exogenous source of folate is required for nucleoprotein synthesis and the maintenance of normal erythropoiesis. Folic acid is the precursor of tetrahydrofolic acid, which is involved as a cofactor for transformylation reactions in the biosynthesis of purines and thymidylates of nucleic acids. Impairment of thymidylate synthesis in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4101280" conceptname="Folic acid deficiency">folic acid deficiency</span> is thought to account for the defective deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4308125" conceptname="Macrocytic anemia">macrocytic anemias</span>.</p>
<p>Folic acid is absorbed rapidly from the small intestine, primarily from the proximal portion. Naturally occurring conjugated folates are reduced enzymatically to folic acid in the gastrointestinal tract prior to absorption. Folic acid appears in the plasma approximately 15 to 30 minutes after an oral dose; peak levels are generally reached within 1 hour. After intravenous administration, the drug is rapidly cleared from the plasma. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of folic acid are several times greater than serum levels of the drug. Folic acid is metabolized in the liver to 7,8-dihydrofolic acid and eventually to 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid with the aid of reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide (DPNH) and folate reductases. Tetrahydrofolic acid is linked in the N<span class="Sup">5</span> or N<span class="Sup">10</span> positions with formyl, hydroxymethyl, methyl, or formimino groups. N<span class="Sup">5</span>-formyltetrahydrofolic acid is leucovorin. Tetrahydrofolic acid derivatives are distributed to all body tissues but are stored primarily in the liver. Normal serum levels of total folate have been reported to be 5 to 15 ng/mL; normal cerebro-spinal fluid levels are approximately 16 to 21 ng/mL. Normal erythrocyte folate levels have been reported to range from 175 to 316 ng/mL. In general, folate serum levels below 5 ng/mL indicate folate defi-ciency, and levels below 2 ng/mL usually result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435789" conceptname="Megaloblastic anemia">megaloblastic anemia</span>.</p>
<p>After a single oral dose of 100 Î¼g of folic acid in a limited number of normal adults, only a trace amount of the drug appeared in the urine. An oral dose of 5 mg in 1 study and a dose of 40 Î¼g/kg of body weight in another study resulted in approximately 50% of the dose appearing in the urine. After a single oral dose of 15 mg, up to 90% of the dose was recovered in the urine. A majority of the metabolic products appeared in the urine after 6 hours; excretion was generally complete within 24 hours. Small amounts of orally administered folic acid have also been recovered in the feces. Folic acid is also excreted in the milk of lactating mothers.</p>

<a name="section-7.1"></a><p></p>
<h2><span class="Bold">General
</span></h2>
<p class="First">Folic acid in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432295" conceptname="Pernicious anemia">pernicious anemia</span> in that hematologic remission can occur while neurologic manifestations remain progressive.</p>
<p>There is a potential danger in administering folic acid to patients with undiagnosed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span>, since folic acid may obscure the diagnosis of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432295" conceptname="Pernicious anemia">pernicious anemia</span> by alleviating the hematologic manifestations of the disease while allowing the neurologic complications to progress. This may result in severe nervous system damage before the correct diagnosis is made.

<a name="section-7.2"></a><p></p>
<h2><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions
</span></h2>
<p class="First">There is evidence that the anticonvulsant action of phenytoin is antagonized by folic acid. A patient whose <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> is completely controlled by phenytoin may require increased doses to prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> if folic acid is given.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4101280" conceptname="Folic acid deficiency">Folate deficiency</span> may result from increased loss of folate, as in renal dialysis and/or interference with metabolism (e.g., folic acid antagonists such as methotrexate); the administration of anticonvulsants, such as diphenylhydantoin, primidone, and barbiturates; alcohol consumption and, especially, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196463" conceptname="Alcoholic cirrhosis">alcoholic cirrhosis</span>; and the administration of pyrimethamine and nitrofurantoin.</p>
<p>False low serum and red cell folate levels may occur if the patient has been taking antibiotics, such as tetracycline, which suppress the growth of <span class="Italics">Lactobacillus casei</span>.</p>

<p>Folic acid is usually indicated in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435789" conceptname="Megaloblastic anemia">megaloblastic anemias</span> of pregnancy. Folic acid requirements are markedly increased during pregnancy, and deficiency will result in fetal damage (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#b0c2f673-b213-43a8-8ca0-461be0d0422e">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</a></span>).</p>
<p>Studies in pregnant women have not shown that folic acid increases the risk of fetal abnormalities if administered during pregnancy. If the drug is used during pregnancy, the possibility of fetal harm appears remote. Because studies cannot rule out the possibility of harm, however, folic acid should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE
</span></h1>
<p class="First">Except during pregnancy and lactation, folic acid should not be given in therapeutic doses greater than 0.4 mg daily until <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432295" conceptname="Pernicious anemia">pernicious anemia</span> has been ruled out. Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432295" conceptname="Pernicious anemia">pernicious anemia</span> receiving more than 0.4 mg of folic acid daily who are inadequately treated with vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> may show reversion of the hematologic parameters to normal, but neurologic manifestations due to vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency will progress. Doses of folic acid exceeding the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) should not be included in multivitamin preparations; if therapeutic amounts are necessary, folic acid should be given separately.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34068-7">
<a name="section-10"></a><p></p>
<h1><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</span></h1>
<p class="First">Oral administration is preferred. Although most patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194993" conceptname="Intestinal malabsorption">malabsorption</span> cannot absorb food folates, they are able to absorb folic acid given orally. Parenteral administration is not advocated but may be necessary in some individuals (e.g., patients receiving parenteral or enteral alimentation). Doses greater than 0.1 mg should not be used unless <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span> due to vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency has been ruled out or is being adequately treated with a cobalamin. Daily doses greater than 1 mg do not enhance the hematologic effect, and most of the excess is excreted unchanged in the urine.</p>
<p>The usual therapeutic dosage in adults and children (regardless of age) is up to 1 mg daily. Resistant cases may require larger doses.</p>
<p>When clinical symptoms have subsided and the blood picture has become normal, a daily maintenance level should be used, i.e., 0.1 mg for infants and up to 0.3 mg for children under 4 years of age, 0.4 mg for adults and children 4 or more years of age, and 0.8 mg for pregnant and lactating women, but never less than 0.1 mg/day. Patients should be kept under close supervision and adjustment of the maintenance level made if relapse appears imminent.</p>
