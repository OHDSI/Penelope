<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">At therapeutic doses, chenodiol suppresses hepatic synthesis of <br>both <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> and cholic acid, gradually replacing the latter and its <br>metabolite, deoxycholic acid in an expanded bile acid pool. These actions <br>contribute to biliary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> desaturation and gradual dissolution of <br>radiolucent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196456" conceptname="Gallstone">gallstones</span> in the presence of a gall-bladder visualized <br>by oral cholecystography. Chenodiol has no effect on radiopaque (calcified) <br><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196456" conceptname="Gallstone">gallstones</span> or on radiolucent bile pigment stones.<br><br>Chenodiol is well absorbed from the small intestine and taken up by the liver <br>where it is converted to its taurine and glycine conjugates and secreted in <br>bile. Owing to 60 % to 80% first-pass hepatic clearance, the body pool of <br>chenodiol resides mainly in the enterohepatic circulation; serum and urinary <br>bile acid levels are not significantly affected during chenodiol therapy.<br><br>At steady-state, an amount of chenodiol near the daily dose escapes to the <br>colon and is converted by bacterial action to lithocholic acid. About 80% of the <br>lithocholate is excreted in the feces; the remainder is absorbed and converted <br>in the liver to its poorly absorbed sulfolithocholyl conjugates. During <br>chenodiol therapy there is only a minor increase in biliary lithocholate, while <br>fecal bile acids are increased three- to fourfold.<br><br>Chenodiol is unequivocally hepatotoxic in many animal species, including <br>sub-human primates at doses close to the human dose. Although the theoretical <br>cause is the metabolite, lithocholic acid, an established hepatotoxin, and man <br>has an efficient mechanism for sulfating and eliminating this substance, there <br>is some evidence that the demonstrated hepatotoxicity is partly due to chenodiol <br>per se. The hepatotoxicity of <br>lithocholic acid is characterized biochemically and morphologically as <br>cholestatic.<br><br>Man has the capacity to form sulfate conjugates of lithocholic acid. <br>Variation in this capacity among individuals has not been well established and a <br>recent published report suggests that patients who develop chenodiol-induced <br>serum aminotransferase elevations are poor sulfators of lithocholic acid (seeÂ Â  ADVERSE <br>REACTIONS andÂ Â Â  WARNINGS).<br></p>

<h2>General Clinical Results</h2>Â Both the desaturation of bile and the clinical dissolution of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196456" conceptname="Gallstone">gallstones</span> are dose-related. In <br>the National Cooperative Gallstone Study (NCGS) involving 305 patients in each <br>treatment group, placebo and chenodiol dosages of 375 mg and 750 mg per day were <br>associated with complete stone dissolution in 0.8%, 5.2% and 13.5%, <br>respectively, of enrolled subjects over 24 months of treatment. Uncontrolled <br>clinical trials using higher doses than those used in the NCGS have shown <br>complete dissolution rates of 28 to 38% of enrolled patients receiving body <br>weight doses of from 13 to 16 mg/kg/day for up to 24 months. In a prospective <br>trial using 15 mg/kg/day, 31% enrolled surgical-risk patients treated more than <br>six months (n = 86) achieved complete confirmed dissolutions.<br><br>Observed stone dissolution rates achieved with chenodiol treatment are higher <br>in subgroups having certain pretreatment characteristics. In the NCGS, patients <br>with small {less than 15 mm in diameter} radiolucent stones, the observed rate <br>of complete dissolution was approximately 20% on 750 mg/day. In the uncontrolled <br>trails using 13 to 16 mg/kg/day doses of chenodiol, the rates of complete <br>dissolution for small radiolucent stones ranged from 42% to 60%. Even higher <br>dissolution rates have been observed in patients with small floatable stones. <br>(See Floatable versus Nonfloatable Stones, below). Some <br>obese patients and occasional normal weight patients fail to achieve bile <br>desaturation even with doses of chenodiol up to 19 mg/kg/day for unknown <br>reasons. Although dissolution is generally higher with increased dosage of <br>chenodiol, doses that are too low are associated with increased cholecystectomy <br>rates (seeÂ Â Â  ADVERSE REACTIONS).<br><br>Stones have recurred within five years in about 50% of patients following <br>complete confirmed dissolutions. Although retreatment with chenodiol has proven <br>successful in dissolving some newly formed stones, the indications for and <br>safety of retreatment are not well defined. Serum aminotransferase elevations <br>and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span> have been notable in all clinical trials and are dose-related <br>(refer toÂ Â Â  ADVERSE REACTIONS and WARNINGSsections <br>for full information).</div>

<h2>Floatable versus Nonfloatable Stones</h2>
<p class="First">A major finding in clinical trials was a difference between floatable and nonfloatable stones, <br>with respect to both natural history and response to chenodiol. Over the <br>two-year course of the National Cooperative Gallstone Study (NCGS), placebo â€“ <br>treated patients with floatable stones (n = 47) had significantly higher rates <br>of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4291807" conceptname="Biliary colic">biliary pain</span> and cholecystectomy than patients with nonfloatable stones (n = <br>258) (47% versus 27% and 19%versus 4%, respectively). Chenodiol treatment (750 <br>mg/day) compared to placebo was associated with a significant reduction in both <br><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4291807" conceptname="Biliary colic">biliary pain</span> and the cholecystectomy rates in the group with floatable stones <br>(27% versus 47% and 1.5% versus 19%, respectively). In an uncontrolled clinical <br>trial using 15 mg/kg/day, 70% of the patients with small (less than 15 mm) <br>floatable stones (n = 10) had complete confirmed dissolution.<br><br>In the NCGS in patients with nonfloatable stones, chenodiol produced no <br>reduction in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4291807" conceptname="Biliary colic">biliary pain</span> and showed a tendency to increase the cholecystectomy <br>rate (8% versus 4%). This finding was more pronounced with doses of chenodiol <br>below 10 mg/kg. The subgroup of patients with nonfloatable stones and a history <br>of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4291807" conceptname="Biliary colic">biliary pain</span> had the highest rates of cholecystectomy and aminotransferase <br>elevations during chenodiol treatment. Except for the NCGS subgroup with <br>pretreatment <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4291807" conceptname="Biliary colic">biliary pain</span>, dose-related aminotransferase elevations and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span> <br>have occurred with equal frequency in patients with floatable or nonfloatable <br>stones. In the uncontrolled clinical trial mentioned above, 27% of the patients <br>with nonfloatable stones (n = 59) had complete confirmed dissolutions, including <br>35% with small (less than 15 mm)(n= 40) and only 11% with large, nonfloatable <br>stones (n= 19).<br><br>Of 916 patients enrolled NCGS, 17.6% had stones seen in upright form <br>(horizontal X-ray beam) to float in the dye-laden bile during oral <br>cholecystography using iopanoic acid. Other investigators report similar <br>findings. Floatable stones are not detected by ultrasonography in the absence <br>for dye. Chemical analysis has shown floatable stones to be essentially pure <br><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>).<br></p>

<a name="section-4.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Other Radiographic and Laboratory Features</h2>
<p class="First">Radiolucent stones may have rims or centers of opacity representing <br>calcification. Pigment stones and partially calcified radiolucent stones do not <br>respond to chenodiol. Subtle calcification can sometimes be detected in flat <br>film X-rays, if not obvious in the oral cholecystogram. Among nonfloatable <br>stones, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> stones are more apt than pigment stones to be smooth <br>surfaced, less than 0.5 cm in diameter, and to occur in numbers less than 10. As <br>stone size number and volume increase, the probability of dissolution within 24 <br>months decreases. Hemolytic disorders, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435243" conceptname="Alcohol dependence">chronic alcoholism</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192675" conceptname="Biliary cirrhosis">biliary cirrhosis</span> and <br>bacterial invasion of the biliary system predispose to pigment gallstone <br>formation. Pigment stones of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135822" conceptname="Primary biliary cirrhosis">primary biliary cirrhosis</span> should be suspected in <br>patients with elevated alkaline phosphates, especially if positive <br>anti-mitochondrial antibodies are present. The presence of microscopic <br><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> crystals in aspirated gallbladder bile, and demonstration of <br><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> super saturation by bile lipid analysis increase the likelihood that <br>the stones are <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> stones.<br></p>

<h1>PATIENT SELECTION</h1>
<br>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-6"></a><p></p>
<h1>Evaluation of Surgical Risk</h1>Surgery offers the advantage of immediate and permanent stone removal, but carries a fairly high risk. In some patients, about 5% of cholecystectomized patients have residual symptoms or retained common duct stones. The spectrum to surgical risk varies as a function of age and the presence of disease other than <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4098112" conceptname="Biliary sludge">cholelithiasis</span>. Selected tabulation of results from the National Halothane Study (JAMA, 1968, 197:775-778) is shown below: the study included 27,600 cholecystectomies.<br><br><div class="Figure"><img alt="Mortality per Operation Table" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=b8b4539b-31d1-40cb-b284-86cf8b16522a&amp;name=Mortality-table.jpg"></div>
<br><br>Women in good health, or having only moderate systemic disease, under 49 years of age have the lowest rate (0.054%); men in all categories have a surgical mortality rate twice that of women; common duct exploration quadruples the rates in all categories; the rates rise with each decade of life and increase tenfold or more in all categories with severe or extreme systemic disease.<br>Relatively young patients requiring treatment might be better treated by surgery than with chenodiol, because treatment with chenodiol, even if successful, is associated with a high rate of recurrence. The long-term consequences of repeated courses of chenodiol in terms of liver toxicity, neoplasia and elevated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> levels are not known. Watchful waiting has the advantage that no therapy may ever be required. For patients with silent or minimally symptomatic stones, the rate of moderate to severe symptoms or gallstone complications is estimated to be between 2% and 6% per year, leading to a cumulative rate of 7% and 27% in five years. Presumably the rate is higher for patients already having symptoms.</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34067-9">
<a name="section-7"></a><p></p>
<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Chenodal (chenodiol tablets) is indicated for patients with radiolucent stones in well-opacifying gallbladders, in whom selective surgery would be undertaken except for the presence of increased surgical risk due to systemic disease or age. The likelihood of successful dissolution is far greater if the stones are floatable or small. For patients with nonfloatable stones, dissolution is less likely and added weight should be given to the risk that more emergent surgery might result form a delay due to unsuccessful treatment. Safety of use beyond 24 months is not established. Chenodiol will not dissolve calcified (radiopaque) or radiolucent bile pigment stones.<br></p>

<h2>Pregnancy Category X</h2>Chenodal (chenodiol tablets) may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Serious <br>hepatic, renal and adrenal lesions occurred in fetuses of female Rhesus monkeys <br>given 60 to 90 mg/kg/day (4 to 6 times the maximum recommended human dose, MRHD) <br>from day 21 to day 45 of pregnancy. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4104000" conceptname="Lesion of liver">Hepatic lesions</span> also occurred in neonatal <br>baboons whose mothers had received 18 to 38 mg/kg ( 1 to 2 times the MRHD), all <br>during pregnancy. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079975" conceptname="Congenital malformation">Fetal malformations</span> were not observed. Neither fetal liver <br>damage nor fetal abnormalities occurred in reproduction studies in rats and <br>hamsters. No human data are available at this time. Chenodal (chenodiol tablets) is contraindicated <br>in women who are or may become pregnant.

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>Safe use of chenodiol depends upon selection of patients without <br>pre-existing liver disease and upon faithful monitoring of serum <br>aminotransferase levels to detect drug-induced liver toxicity. Aminotransferase <br>elevations over three times the upper limit of normal have required <br>discontinuation of chenodiol in 2% to 3% of patients. Although clinical and <br>biopsy studies have not shown fulminant lesions, the possibility remains that an <br>occasional patient may develop serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span>.

<span class="Bold"><br></span><div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34076-0">
<a name="section-10.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Information for patients</h2>
<p class="First">Patients should be counseled on the importance of periodic visits <br>for liver function tests and oral cholecystograms (or ultrasonograms) for <br>monitoring stone dissolution; they should be made aware of the symptoms of <br>gallstone complications and be warned to report immediately such symptoms to the <br>physician. Patients should be instructed on ways to facilitate faithful <br>compliance with the dosage regimen throughout the usual long term of therapy, <br>and on temporary doses reduction if episodes of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span> occur.<br></p>

<a name="section-10.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Drug interactions</h2>Bile acid sequestering agents, such as cholestyramine and <br>colestipol, may interfere with the action of Chenodiol by reducing its <br>absorption. Aluminum-based antacids have been shown to absorb bile acids in <br>vitro and may be expected to interfere with Chenodiol in the same manner as the <br>sequestering agents.

<h2>Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility</h2>
<p class="First">A two-year oral study of chenodiol in rats failed to show a <br>carcinogenic potential at the tested levels of 15 to 60 mg/kg/day (1 to 4 times <br>the maximum recommended human dose, MRHD). It has been reported that chenodiol <br>given in long-term studies at oral doses up to 600 mg/kg/day (40 times the MRHD) <br>to rats and 1000 mg/kg/day (65 times the MRHD) to mice induced benign and <br>malignant liver cell tumors in female rats and cholangiomata in female rats and <br>male mice. Two-year studies of lithocholic acid ( a major metabolite of <br>chenodiol) in mice (125 to 250 mg/kg/day) and rats (250 and 500 mg/kg/day) found <br>it not to be carcinogenic.

<h2>Hepatobiliary</h2>
<p class="First">Dose-related serum aminotransferase (mainly SGPT) elevations, usually not accompanied by rises in <br>alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin, occurred in 30% or more of patients treated with the recommended dose of Chenodiol. In most cases, these elevations were <br>minor (1 Â½ to 3 times the upper limit of laboratory normal) and transient, returning to within the normal range within six months despite continued <br>administration of the drug. In 2% to 3% of patients, SGPT levels rose to over three times the upper limit of laboratory normal, recurred on rechallenge with <br>the drug, and required discontinuation of chenodiol treatment. Enzyme levels have returned to normal following withdrawal of chenodiol (see WARNINGS).<br><br>Morphologic studies of liver biopsies taken before and after 9 and 24 months of treatment with chenodiol have shown that 63% of the patients prior to <br>chenodiol treatment had evidence of intrahepatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4143915" conceptname="Cholestasis">cholestasis</span>. Almost all pretreatment patients had electron microscopic abnormalities. By the ninth month <br>of treatment, reexamination of two-thirds of the patients showed an 89% incidence of the signs of intrahepatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4143915" conceptname="Cholestasis">cholestasis</span>. Two of 89 patients at the <br>ninth month had lithocholate-like lesions in the canalicular membrane, although there were not clinical enzyme abnormalities in the face of continued treatment <br>and no change in Type 2 light microscopic parameters.<br></p>

<p class="First">NCGS patients with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4291807" conceptname="Biliary colic">biliary pain</span> prior to treatment had higher cholecystectomy rates <br>during the study if assigned to low dosage chenodiol (375 mg/day) than if <br>assigned to either placebo or high dosage chenodiol (750 mg/day).

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>The recommended dose range for Chenodal (chenodiol tablets) is 13 to 16 mg/kg/day in two divided doses, morning and night, starting with 250 mg b.i.d. the first two <br>weeks and increasing by 250 mg/day each week thereafter until the recommended or maximum tolerated dose is reached. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span> occurs during dosage buildup or <br>later in treatment, it usually can be controlled by temporary dosage adjustment until symptoms abate, after which the previous dosage usually is tolerated. <br>Dosage less than 10 mg/kg usually is ineffective and may be associated with increased risk of cholecystectomy, so is not recommended. <br><br><div class="Figure"><img alt="Weight-Dosage Guide" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=b8b4539b-31d1-40cb-b284-86cf8b16522a&amp;name=Weight-Dosage.jpg"></div>
<br><br>The optimal frequency of monitoring liver function tests is not known. It is suggested that serum aminotransferase levels should be monitored monthly for the <br>first three months and every three months thereafter during Chenodal (chenodiol tablets) administration. Under NCGS guidelines, if a minor, usually transient elevations <br>(1 Â½ to3 three times the upper limit of normal) persisted longer than three to six months. Chenodiol was discontinued and resumed only after the <br>aminotransferase level returned to normal; however, allowing the elevations to persist over such an interval is not know to be safe. Elevations over three <br>times the upper limit of normal require immediate discontinuation of Chenodal (chenodiol tablets) and usually reoccur on challenge.<br><br>Serum <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> should be monitored at six months intervals. It may be advisable to discontinue Chenodal (chenodiol tablets) if <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> rises above the acceptable <br>age-adjusted limit for given patient.<br><br>Oral cholecystograms or ultrasonograms are recommend at six to nine month intervals to monitor response. Complete dissolutions should be confirmed by a <br>repeat test after one to three months continued Chenodal (chenodiol tablets) administration. Most patients who eventually achieve complete dissolution will show partial (or <br>complete) dissolution at the first on-treatment test. If partial dissolution is not seen by nine to 12 months, the likelihood of success of treating loner is <br>greatly reduced; Chenodal (chenodiol tablets) should be discontinued if there is no response by 18 months. Safety of use beyond 24 months is not established.<br><br>Stone recurrence can be expected within five years in 50% of cases. After confirmed dissolution, treatment generally should be stopped. Serial <br>cholecystograms or ultrasonograms are recommended to monitor for recurrence, keeping in mind that radiolucency and gallbladder function should be established <br>before starting another course of Chenodal (chenodiol tablets). A <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118659" conceptname="Prophylactic">prophylactic</span> doses is not established; reduced doses cannot be recommended; stones have recurred on 500 <br>mg/day.
