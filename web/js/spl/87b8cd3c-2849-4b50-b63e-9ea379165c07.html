<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Albuterol tablets contain albuterol sulfate, USP, the racemic form of albuterol and a relatively selective beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic bronchodilator. Albuterol sulfate has the chemical name Î±<span class="Sup">1</span>-[(<span class="Italics">tert</span>-Butylamino)methyl]-4-hydroxy-<span class="Italics">m</span>-xylene-Î±,Î±'-diol sulfate (2:1)(salt) and the following structural formula:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="Chemical Structure" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=87b8cd3c-2849-4b50-b63e-9ea379165c07&amp;name=albuterol-01.jpg"></div>
<p>Albuterol sulfate has a molecular weight of 576.71, and the molecular formula is (C<span class="Sub">13</span>H<span class="Sub">21</span>NO<span class="Sub">3</span>)<span class="Sub">2</span>â€¢H<span class="Sub">2</span>SO<span class="Sub">4</span>. Albuterol sulfate is a white or practically white powder, freely soluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization recommended name for albuterol base is salbutamol.</p>
<p>Each albuterol sulfate tablet, for oral administration contains 2 or 4 mg of albuterol as 2.4 or 4.8 mg of albuterol sulfate, respectively. Each tablet also contains the following inactive ingredients: anhydrous lactose, magnesium stearate, pregelatinized (corn) starch, and sodium starch glycolate.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that albuterol has a preferential effect on beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic receptors compared with isoproterenol. While it is recognized that beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, data indicate that there is a population of beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-receptors in the human heart existing in a concentration between 10% and 50%. The precise function of these receptors has not been established (see <a href="#WARNINGS">WARNINGS</a>).</p>
<p>The pharmacologic effects of beta-adrenergic agonist drugs, including albuterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation through beta-adrenergic receptors of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223759" conceptname="IgE-mediated allergic disorder">immediate hypersensitivity</span> from cells, especially from mast cells.</p>
<p>Albuterol has been shown in most controlled clinical trials to have more effect on the respiratory tract, in the form of bronchial smooth <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">muscle relaxation</span>, than isoproterenol at comparable doses while producing fewer cardiovascular effects.</p>
<p>Albuterol is longer acting than isoproterenol in most patients by any route of administration because it is not a substrate for the cellular uptake processes for catecholamines nor for catechol-<span class="Italics">O</span>-methyl transferase.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-3.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Preclinical</h2>
<p class="First">Intravenous studies in rats with albuterol sulfate have demonstrated that albuterol crosses the blood brain barrier and reaches brain concentrations amounting to approximately 5% of the plasma concentrations. In structures outside the brain barrier (pineal and pituitary glands), albuterol concentrations were found to be 100 times those in the whole brain.</p>
<p>Studies in laboratory animals (minipigs, rodents, and dogs) have demonstrated the occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmias</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4132309" conceptname="Sudden death">sudden death</span> (with histologic evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4354249" conceptname="Myocardial necrosis">myocardial necrosis</span>) when beta-agonists and methylxanthines are administered concurrently. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="43682-4">
<a name="section-3.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Albuterol is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of one 4 mg albuterol tablet in normal volunteers. Maximum plasma concentrations of about 18 ng/mL of albuterol are achieved within 2 hours, and the drug is eliminated with a half-life of about 5 hours.</p>
<p>In other studies, the analysis of urine samples of patients given 8 mg of tritiated albuterol orally showed that 76% of the dose was excreted over 3 days, with the majority of the dose being excreted within the first 24 hours. Sixty percent of this radioactivity was shown to be the metabolite. Feces collected over this period contained 4% of the administered dose.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34092-7">
<a name="section-3.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Clinical Trials</h2>
<p class="First">In controlled clinical trials in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>, the onset of improvement in pulmonary function, as measured by maximum midexpiratory flow rate (MMEF), was within 30 minutes after a dose of albuterol tablets, with peak improvement occurring between 2 and 3 hours. In controlled clinical trials in which measurements were conducted for 6 hours, clinically significant improvement (defined as maintaining a 15% or more increase in forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV<span class="Sub">1</span>] and a 20% or more increase in MMEF over baseline values) was observed in 60% of patients at 4 hours and in 40% at 6 hours. In other single-dose, controlled clinical trials, clinically significant improvement was observed in at least 40% of the patients at 8 hours. No decrease in the effectiveness of albuterol tablets was reported in patients who received long-term treatment with the drug in uncontrolled studies for periods up to 6 months.</p>

<h2>Cardiovascular Effects</h2>
<p class="First">Albuterol tablets, like all other beta-adrenergic agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, and/or symptoms. Although such effects are uncommon after administration of albuterol tablets at recommended doses, if they occur, the drug may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4095285" conceptname="ST segment depression">ST segment depression</span>. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34072-9">
<a name="section-7.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Albuterol, as with all sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134057" conceptname="Disorder of cardiovascular system">cardiovascular disorders</span>, especially coronary insufficiency, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmias</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>; in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsive disorders</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142479" conceptname="Hyperthyroidism">hyperthyroidism</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus; and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Clinically significant changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure have been seen in individual patients and could be expected to occur in some patients after use of any beta-adrenergic bronchodilator.</p>
<p>Large doses of intravenous albuterol have been reported to aggravate preexisting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4209145" conceptname="Ketoacidosis">ketoacidosis</span>. As with other beta-agonists, albuterol may produce significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span> in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease is usually transient, not requiring supplementation.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34076-0">
<a name="section-7.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">The action of albuterol tablets may last up to 8 hours or longer. Albuterol tablets should not be taken more frequently than recommended. Do not increase the dose or frequency of albuterol tablets without consulting your physician. If you find that treatment with albuterol tablets becomes less effective for symptomatic relief, your symptoms get worse, and/or you need to take the product more frequently than usual, you should seek medical attention immediately. While you are taking albuterol tablets, other <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> medications and inhaled drugs should be taken only as directed by your physician. Common adverse effects include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315078" conceptname="Palpitations">palpitations</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77670" conceptname="Chest pain">chest pain</span>, rapid heart rate, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436817" conceptname="Feeling nervous">nervousness</span>. If you are pregnant or nursing, contact your physician about use of albuterol tablets. Effective and safe use of albuterol tablets includes an understanding of the way that it should be administered.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34073-7">
<a name="section-7.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">The concomitant use of albuterol tablets and other oral sympathomimetic agents is not recommended since such combined use may lead to deleterious cardiovascular effects. This recommendation does not preclude the judicious use of an aerosol bronchodilator of the adrenergic stimulant type in patients receiving albuterol tablets. Such concomitant use, however, should be individualized and not given on a routine basis. If regular coadministration is required, then alternative therapy should be considered.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-7.3.1"></a><p></p>
<p class="First">Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors or Tricyclic Antidepressants</p>
<p>Albuterol should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents, because the action of albuterol on the vascular system may be potentiated.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-7.3.2"></a><p></p>
<p class="First">Beta-Blockers</p>
<p>Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists, such as albuterol tablets, but may produce severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256717" conceptname="Bronchospasm">bronchospasm</span> in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatic</span> patients. Therefore, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, e.g., as prophylaxis after <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>. In this setting, cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-7.3.3"></a><p></p>
<p class="First">Diuretics</p>
<p>The ECG changes and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span> that may result from the administration of nonpotassium-sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of beta-agonists with nonpotassium-sparing diuretics.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-7.3.4"></a><p></p>
<p class="First">Digoxin</p>
<p>Mean decreases of 16% to 22% in serum digoxin levels were demonstrated after single-dose intravenous and oral administration of albuterol, respectively, to normal volunteers who had received digoxin for 10 days. The clinical significance of these findings for patients with obstructive airway disease who are receiving albuterol and digoxin on a chronic basis is unclear. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to carefully evaluate the serum digoxin levels in patients who are currently receiving digoxin and albuterol.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">In a 2-year study in Sprague-Dawley rats, albuterol sulfate caused a significant dose-related increase in the incidence of benign leiomyomas of the mesovarium at dietary doses of 2, 10, and 50 mg/kg (approximately <span class="Sup">1</span>/<span class="Sub">2</span>, 3 and 15 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily oral dose for adults on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, or, <span class="Sup">2</span>â?„<span class="Sub">5</span>, 2 and 10 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily oral dose for children on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). In another study this effect was blocked by the coadministration of propranolol, a non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist.</p>
<p>In an 18-month study in CD-1 mice albuterol sulfate showed no evidence of tumorigenicity at dietary doses of up to 500 mg/kg, (approximately 65 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose for adults on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, or, approximately 50 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose for children on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). In a 22-month study in the Golden hamster albuterol sulfate showed no evidence of tumorigenicity at dietary doses of up to 50 mg/kg, (approximately 8 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose for adults on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, or, approximately 7 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose for children on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).</p>
<p>Albuterol sulfate was not mutagenic in the Ames test with or without metabolic activation using tester <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> <span class="Italics">S. typhimurium</span> TA1537, TA1538, and TA98 or <span class="Italics">E.

A study in CD-1 mice at subcutaneous (sc) doses of 0.025, 0.25, and 2.5 mg/kg, (approximately 3/1000, 3/100, and 3/10 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily oral dose for adults on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis), showed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135923" conceptname="Cleft palate">cleft palate</span> formation in 5 of 111 (4.5%) fetuses at 0.25 mg/kg and in 10 of 108 (9.3%) fetuses at 2.5 mg/kg. The drug did not induce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135923" conceptname="Cleft palate">cleft palate</span> formation at the lowest dose, 0.025 mg/kg. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135923" conceptname="Cleft palate">Cleft palate</span> also occurred in 22 of 72 (30.5%) fetuses from females treated with 2.5 mg/kg of isoproterenol (positive control) subcutaneously (approximately 3/10 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose for adults on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).</p>
<p>A reproduction study in Stride Dutch rabbits revealed cranioschisis in 7 of 19 (37%) fetuses when albuterol was administered orally at a 50 mg/kg dose (approximately 25 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose for adults on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Albuterol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">The expected symptoms with overdosage are those of excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation and/or occurrence or exaggeration of any of the symptoms listed under ADVERSE REACTIONS, e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>, angina, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span> with rates up to 200 beats/min, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436817" conceptname="Feeling nervous">nervousness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226991" conceptname="Aptyalism">dry mouth</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315078" conceptname="Palpitations">palpitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4272240" conceptname="Malaise">malaise</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">sleeplessness</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">Hypokalemia</span> may also occur. As with all sympathomimetic medications, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span> and even <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> may be associated with abuse of albuterol tablets. Treatment consists of discontinuation of albuterol tablets together with appropriate symptomatic therapy. The judicious use of a cardioselective beta-receptor blocker may be considered, bearing in mind that such medication can produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256717" conceptname="Bronchospasm">bronchospasm</span>. There is insufficient evidence to determine if dialysis is beneficial for overdosage of albuterol tablets. The oral median lethal dose of albuterol sulfate in mice is greater than 2000 mg/kg (approximately 250 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose for adults on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, or, approximately 200 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose for children on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). In mature rats, the subcutaneous (sc) median lethal dose of albuterol sulfate is approximately 450 mg/kg (approximately 110 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose for adults on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis or, approximately 90 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose for children on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). In small young rats, the subcutaneous median lethal dose is approximately 2000 mg/kg (approximately 500 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose for adults on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, or, approximately 400 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose for children on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).</p>
