<h1>BOXED WARNING SECTION</h1>
<p class="First">Suicidality and Antidepressant Drugs</p>
<p>Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of paroxetine tablets, USP or any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. Paroxetine tablets, USP are not approved for use in pediatric patients.

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION</h1>
<p class="First">Pharmacodynamics</p>
<p>The efficacy of paroxetine in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440374" conceptname="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">obsessive compulsive disorder</span> (OCD), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> (PD), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434613" conceptname="Generalized anxiety disorder">generalized anxiety disorder</span> (GAD) is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system resulting from inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-hydroxy-tryptamine, 5-HT). Studies at clinically relevant doses in humans have demonstrated that paroxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. In vitro studies in animals also suggest that paroxetine is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake. In vitro radioligand binding studies indicate that paroxetine has little affinity for muscarinic, alpha1-, alpha2-, beta-adrenergic-, dopamine (D2)-, 5-HT1-, 5-HT2-, and histamine (H1)-receptors; antagonism of muscarinic, histaminergic, and alpha1-adrenergic receptors has been associated with various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular effects for other psychotropic drugs.</p>
<p>Because the relative potencies of paroxetine’s major metabolites are at most 1/50 of the parent compound, they are essentially inactive.</p>
<p>Pharmacokinetics</p>
<p>Paroxetine hydrochloride is completely absorbed after oral dosing of a solution of the hydrochloride salt. The mean elimination half-life is approximately 21 hours (CV 32%) after oral dosing of 30 mg tablets of paroxetine daily for 30 days. Paroxetine is extensively metabolized and the metabolites are considered to be inactive. Nonlinearity in pharmacokinetics is observed with increasing doses. Paroxetine metabolism is mediated in part by CYP2D6, and the metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine and to some extent in the feces. Pharmacokinetic behavior of paroxetine has not been evaluated in subjects who are deficient in CYP2D6 (poor metabolizers).</p>
<p>In a meta-analysis of paroxetine from 4 studies done in healthy volunteers following multiple dosing of 20 mg/day to 40 mg/day, males did not exhibit a significantly lower Cmax or AUC than females.</p>
<p>Absorption and Distribution</p>
<p>Paroxetine is equally bioavailable from the oral suspension and tablet.</p>
<p>Paroxetine hydrochloride is completely absorbed after oral dosing of a solution of the hydrochloride salt. In a study in which normal male subjects (n = 15) received 30 mg tablets daily for 30 days, steady-state paroxetine concentrations were achieved by approximately 10 days for most subjects, although it may take substantially longer in an occasional patient. At steady state, mean values of Cmax, Tmax, Cmin, and T½ were 61.7 ng/mL (CV 45%), 5.2 hr. (CV 10%), 30.7 ng/mL (CV 67%), and 21.0 hours (CV 32%), respectively. The steady-state Cmax and Cmin values were about 6 and 14 times what would be predicted from single-dose studies. Steady-state drug exposure based on AUC0-24 was about 8 times greater than would have been predicted from single-dose data in these subjects. The excess accumulation is a consequence of the fact that 1 of the enzymes that metabolizes paroxetine is readily saturable.</p>
<p>The effects of food on the bioavailability of paroxetine were studied in subjects administered a single dose with and without food. AUC was only slightly increased (6%) when drug was administered with food but the Cmax was 29% greater, while the time to reach peak plasma concentration decreased from 6.4 hours post-dosing to 4.9 hours.</p>
<p>Paroxetine distributes throughout the body, including the CNS, with only 1% remaining in the plasma.</p>
<p>Approximately 95% and 93% of paroxetine is bound to plasma protein at 100 ng/mL and 400 ng/mL, respectively. Under clinical conditions, paroxetine concentrations would normally be less than 400 ng/mL. Paroxetine does not alter the in vitro protein binding of phenytoin or warfarin.</p>
<p>Metabolism and Excretion</p>
<p>The mean elimination half-life is approximately 21 hours (CV 32%) after oral dosing of 30 mg tablets daily for 30 days of Paroxetine hydrochloride. In steady-state dose proportionality studies involving elderly and nonelderly patients, at doses of 20 mg to 40 mg daily for the elderly and 20 mg to 50 mg daily for the nonelderly, some nonlinearity was observed in both populations, again reflecting a saturable metabolic pathway. In comparison to Cmin values after 20 mg daily, values after 40 mg daily were only about 2 to 3 times greater than doubled.</p>
<p>Paroxetine is extensively metabolized after oral administration. The principal metabolites are polar and conjugated products of oxidation and methylation, which are readily cleared. Conjugates with glucuronic acid and sulfate predominate, and major metabolites have been isolated and identified. Data indicate that the metabolites have no more than 1/50 the potency of the parent compound at inhibiting serotonin uptake. The metabolism of paroxetine is accomplished in part by CYP2D6. Saturation of this enzyme at clinical doses appears to account for the nonlinearity of paroxetine kinetics with increasing dose and increasing duration of treatment. The role of this enzyme in paroxetine metabolism also suggests potential drug-drug interactions (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_4FF5DBBC-18A8-25DE-4CFE-A55D63D25A84">PRECAUTIONS: Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6</a>).</p>
<p>Approximately 64% of a 30-mg oral solution dose of paroxetine was excreted in the urine with 2% as the parent compound and 62% as metabolites over a 10-day post-dosing period. About 36% was excreted in the feces (probably via the bile), mostly as metabolites and less than 1% as the parent compound over the 10-day post-dosing period.</p>
<p>Other Clinical Pharmacology InformationSpecific PopulationsRenal and Liver Disease</p>
<p>Increased plasma concentrations of paroxetine occur in subjects with renal and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>. The mean plasma concentrations in patients with creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min. were approximately 4 times greater than seen in normal volunteers. Patients with creatinine clearance of 30 to 60 mL/min. and patients with hepatic functional impairment had about a 2-fold increase in plasma concentrations (AUC, Cmax).</p>
<p>The initial dosage should therefore be reduced in patients with severe renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>, and upward titration, if necessary, should be at increased intervals (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_CB52CA1B-9E5C-4EE9-409E-70225180C0EB">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>
<p>Elderly Patients</p>
<p>In a multiple-dose study in the elderly at daily paroxetine doses of 20, 30, and 40 mg, Cmin concentrations were about 70% to 80% greater than the respective Cmin concentrations in nonelderly subjects. Therefore the initial dosage in the elderly should be reduced (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_CB52CA1B-9E5C-4EE9-409E-70225180C0EB">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>
<p>Drug-Drug Interactions</p>
<p>In vitro drug interaction studies reveal that paroxetine inhibits CYP2D6. Clinical drug interaction studies have been performed with substrates of CYP2D6 and show that paroxetine can inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 including desipramine, risperidone, and atomoxetine (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_ABAA2F32-1552-4C00-CA79-B42E5E3A2AD2">PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions</a>).</p>
<p>Clinical TrialsMajor <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depressive Disorder</span></p>
<p>The efficacy of paroxetine as a treatment for major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> has been established in 6 placebo-controlled studies of patients with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (aged 18 to 73). In these studies, paroxetine was shown to be significantly more effective than placebo in treating major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> by at least 2 of the following measures: Hamilton <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> Rating Scale (HDRS), the Hamilton <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="40546087" conceptname="Depressed mood">depressed mood</span> item, and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-Severity of Illness. Paroxetine was significantly better than placebo in improvement of the HDRS sub-factor scores, including the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="40546087" conceptname="Depressed mood">depressed mood</span> item, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435524" conceptname="Sleep disorder">sleep disturbance</span> factor, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> factor.</p>
<p>A study of outpatients with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> who had responded to paroxetine (HDRS total score &lt;8) during an initial 8-week open-treatment phase and were then randomized to continuation on paroxetine or placebo for 1 year demonstrated a significantly lower relapse rate for patients taking paroxetine (15%) compared to those on placebo (39%). Effectiveness was similar for male and female patients.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440374" conceptname="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">obsessive compulsive disorder</span> (OCD) was demonstrated in two 12-week multicenter placebo-controlled studies of adult outpatients (Studies 1 and 2). Patients in all studies had moderate to severe OCD (DSM-IIIR) with mean baseline ratings on the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) total score ranging from 23 to 26. Study 1, a dose-range finding study where patients were treated with fixed doses of 20, 40, or 60 mg of paroxetine/day demonstrated that daily doses of paroxetine 40 and 60 mg are effective in the treatment of OCD. Patients receiving doses of 40 and 60 mg paroxetine experienced a mean reduction of approximately 6 and 7 points, respectively, on the YBOCS total score which was significantly greater than the approximate 4-point reduction at 20 mg and a 3-point reduction in the placebo-treated patients. Study 2 was a flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine (20 to 60 mg daily) with clomipramine (25 to 250 mg daily). In this study, patients receiving paroxetine experienced a mean reduction of approximately 7 points on the YBOCS total score, which was significantly greater than the mean reduction of approximately 4 points in placebo-treated patients.</p>

<p>The long-term maintenance effects of paroxetine in OCD were demonstrated in a long-term extension to Study 1. Patients who were responders on paroxetine during the 3-month double-blind phase and a 6-month extension on open-label paroxetine (20 to 60 mg/day) were randomized to either paroxetine or placebo in a 6-month double-blind relapse prevention phase.

<p>The effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> was demonstrated in three 10- to 12-week multicenter, placebo-controlled studies of adult outpatients (Studies 1 to 3). Patients in all studies had <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> (DSM-IIIR), with or without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4321835" conceptname="Agoraphobia">agoraphobia</span>. In these studies, paroxetine was shown to be significantly more effective than placebo in treating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> by at least 2 out of 3 measures of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021498" conceptname="Panic attack">panic attack</span> frequency and on the Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness score.</p>
<p>Study 1 was a 10-week dose-range finding study; patients were treated with fixed paroxetine doses of 10, 20, or 40 mg/day or placebo. A significant difference from placebo was observed only for the 40 mg/day group. At endpoint, 76% of patients receiving paroxetine 40 mg/day were free of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021498" conceptname="Panic attack">panic attacks</span>, compared to 44% of placebo-treated patients.</p>
<p>Study 2 was a 12-week flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine (10 to 60 mg daily) and placebo. At endpoint, 51% of paroxetine patients were free of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021498" conceptname="Panic attack">panic attacks</span> compared to 32% of placebo-treated patients.</p>
<p>Study 3 was a 12-week flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine (10 to 60 mg daily) to placebo in patients concurrently receiving standardized cognitive behavioral therapy. At endpoint, 33% of the paroxetine-treated patients showed a reduction to 0 or 1 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021498" conceptname="Panic attack">panic attacks</span> compared to 14% of placebo patients.</p>
<p>In both Studies 2 and 3, the mean paroxetine dose for completers at endpoint was approximately 40 mg/day of paroxetine.</p>
<p>Long-term maintenance effects of paroxetine in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> were demonstrated in an extension to Study 1. Patients who were responders during the 10-week double-blind phase and during a 3-month double-blind extension phase were randomized to either paroxetine (10, 20, or 40 mg/day) or placebo in a 3-month double-blind relapse prevention phase. Patients randomized to paroxetine were significantly less likely to relapse than comparably treated patients who were randomized to placebo.</p>

<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">Social Anxiety Disorder</span></p>
<p>The effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span> was demonstrated in three 12-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1, 2, and 3) of adult outpatients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span> (DSM-IV). In these studies, the effectiveness of paroxetine compared to placebo was evaluated on the basis of (1) the proportion of responders, as defined by a Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Improvement score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved), and (2) change from baseline in the Liebowitz Social <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">Anxiety</span> Scale (LSAS).</p>
<p>Studies 1 and 2 were flexible-dose studies comparing paroxetine (20 to 50 mg daily) and placebo. Paroxetine demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo on both the CGI Improvement responder criterion and the Liebowitz Social <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">Anxiety</span> Scale (LSAS). In Study 1, for patients who completed to week 12, 69% of paroxetine-treated patients compared to 29% of placebo-treated patients were CGI Improvement responders. In Study 2, CGI Improvement responders were 77% and 42% for the paroxetine- and placebo-treated patients, respectively.</p>
<p>Study 3 was a 12-week study comparing fixed paroxetine doses of 20, 40, or 60 mg/day with placebo. Paroxetine 20 mg was demonstrated to be significantly superior to placebo on both the LSAS Total Score and the CGI Improvement responder criterion; there were trends for superiority over placebo for the 40 mg and 60 mg/day dose groups. There was no indication in this study of any additional benefit for doses higher than 20 mg/day.</p>
<p>Subgroup analyses generally did not indicate differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age, race, or gender.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434613" conceptname="Generalized anxiety disorder">Generalized Anxiety Disorder</span> (GAD) was demonstrated in two 8-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1 and 2) of adult outpatients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434613" conceptname="Generalized anxiety disorder">Generalized Anxiety Disorder</span> (DSM-IV).</p>
<p>Study 1 was an 8-week study comparing fixed paroxetine doses of 20 mg or 40 mg/day with placebo. Doses of 20 mg or 40 mg of paroxetine were both demonstrated to be significantly superior to placebo on the Hamilton Rating Scale for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">Anxiety</span> (HAM-A) total score. There was not sufficient evidence in this study to suggest a greater benefit for the 40 mg/day dose compared to the 20 mg/day dose.</p>
<p>Study 2 was a flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine (20 mg to 50 mg daily) and placebo. Paroxetine demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo on the Hamilton Rating Scale for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">Anxiety</span> (HAM-A) total score. A third study, also flexible-dose comparing paroxetine (20 mg to 50 mg daily), did not demonstrate statistically significant superiority of paroxetine over placebo on the Hamilton Rating Scale for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">Anxiety</span> (HAM-A) total score, the primary outcome.</p>
<p>Subgroup analyses did not indicate differences in treatment outcomes as a function of race or gender. There were insufficient elderly patients to conduct subgroup analyses on the basis of age.</p>
<p>In a longer-term trial, 566 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434613" conceptname="Generalized anxiety disorder">Generalized Anxiety Disorder</span>, who had responded during a single-blind, 8-week acute treatment phase with 20 to 50 mg/day of paroxetine, were randomized to continuation of paroxetine at their same dose, or to placebo, for up to 24 weeks of observation for relapse. Response during the single-blind phase was defined by having a decrease of ≥2 points compared to baseline on the CGI-Severity of Illness scale, to a score of ≤3. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as an increase of ≥2 points compared to baseline on the CGI-Severity of Illness scale to a score of ≥ 4, or withdrawal due to lack of efficacy. Patients receiving continued paroxetine experienced a significantly lower relapse rate over the subsequent 24 weeks compared to those receiving placebo.</p>

<p>The efficacy of paroxetine in the treatment of a major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive episode</span> was established in 6-week controlled trials of outpatients whose diagnoses corresponded most closely to the DSM-III category of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_B643AA0D-BCAD-CB26-AC86-6BE333846CA0">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Trials</a>). A major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive episode</span> implies a prominent and relatively persistent depressed or dysphoric mood that usually interferes with daily functioning (nearly every day for at least 2 weeks); it should include at least 4 of the following 8 symptoms: Change in appetite, change in sleep, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">psychomotor agitation</span> or retardation, loss of interest in usual activities or decrease in sexual drive, increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span>, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4111210" conceptname="Bradyphrenia">slowed thinking</span> or impaired concentration, and a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4219484" conceptname="Suicide attempt">suicide attempt</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4092095" conceptname="Planning suicide">suicidal ideation</span>.</p>

<p>Patients with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and/or the emergence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4092095" conceptname="Planning suicide">suicidal ideation</span> and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> is a known risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.</p>
<p>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440374" conceptname="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">obsessive compulsive disorder</span> (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1,000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.</p>

<p>No <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>.</p>
<p>It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.</p>
<p>All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.</p>
<p>The following symptoms, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021498" conceptname="Panic attack">panic attacks</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4195585" conceptname="Hostile behavior">hostility</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021344" conceptname="Abusive behavior">aggressiveness</span>, impulsivity, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4108925" conceptname="Akathisia">akathisia</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">psychomotor restlessness</span>), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333678" conceptname="Hypomania">hypomania</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">mania</span>, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.</p>
<p>Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.</p>
<p>If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_4FF5DBBC-18A8-25DE-4CFE-A55D63D25A84">PRECAUTIONS</a> and <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_305DC541-8AB2-7CBF-8D1C-0360CB638700">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Discontinuation of Treatment with Paroxetine</a>, for a description of the risks of discontinuation of paroxetine).</p>
<p>Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for paroxetine should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>.</p>
<p>Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder</p>
<p>A major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive episode</span> may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder.  It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic episode</span> in patients at risk for bipolar disorder.  Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown.  However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4191716" conceptname="Symptoms of depression">depressive symptoms</span> should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>, bipolar disorder, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.  It should be noted that paroxetine is not approved for use in treating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436665" conceptname="Bipolar disorder">bipolar depression</span>.</p>

<p>The concomitant use of paroxetine with MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders is contraindicated. Paroxetine should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses. There may be circumstances when it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking paroxetine. Paroxetine should be discontinued before initiating treatment with the MAOI (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_49158A19-DB4A-CA1C-9F32-848D196EBDF7">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a> and <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_CB52CA1B-9E5C-4EE9-409E-70225180C0EB">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>
<p>If concomitant use of paroxetine tablets with certain other serotonergic drugs, i.e., triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, tryptophan, and St. John’s Wort is clinically warranted, be aware of a potential increased risk for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span>, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.</p>
<p>Treatment with paroxetine tablets and any concomitant serotonergic agents,  should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.</p>
<p>Potential Interaction With Thioridazine</p>

<p>An in vivo study suggests that drugs which inhibit CYP2D6, such as paroxetine, will elevate plasma levels of thioridazine.

<p>Usage in PregnancyTeratogenic Effects</p>
<p>Epidemiological studies have shown that infants exposed to paroxetine in the first trimester of pregnancy have   an increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly cardiovascular malformations. The findings from these studies are summarized below: </p>
<ul>
<li>A study based on Swedish national registry data demonstrated that infants exposed to paroxetine during pregnancy (n = 815) had an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations (2% risk in paroxetine-exposed infants) compared to the entire registry population (1 % risk), for an odds ratio (OR) of 1.8 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.8). No increase in the risk of overall congenital malformations was seen in the paroxetine-exposed infants. The cardiac malformations in the paroxetine-exposed infants were primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434462" conceptname="Ventricular septal defect">ventricular septal defects</span> (VSDs) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4289309" conceptname="Atrial septal defect">atrial septal defects</span> (ASDs). Septal defects range in severity from those that resolve spontaneously to those which require surgery.</li>
<li>A separate retrospective cohort study from the United States (United Healthcare data) evaluated 5,956 infants of mothers dispensed antidepressants during the first trimester (n = 815 for paroxetine). This study showed a trend towards an increased risk for cardiovascular malformations for paroxetine (risk of 1.5%) compared to other antidepressants (risk of 1%), for an OR of 1.5 (95% confidence interval 0.8 to 2.9). Of the 12 paroxetine-exposed infants with cardiovascular malformations, 9 had VSDs. This study also suggested an increased risk of overall major congenital malformations including cardiovascular defects for paroxetine (4% risk) compared to other (2% risk) antidepressants (OR 1.8; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to2.8).</li>
<li>Two large case-control studies using separate databases, each with &gt;9,000 birth defect cases and &gt;4,000 controls, found that maternal use of paroxetine during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of right ventricular outflow tract obstructions. In one study the odds ratio was 2.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 6.0, 7 exposed infants) and in the other study the odds ratio was 3.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 8.8, 6 exposed infants). </li>
</ul>
<p>Other studies have found varying results as to whether there was an increased risk of overall, cardiovascular, or specific congenital malformations. A meta-analysis of epidemiological data over a 16-year period (1992 to 2008) on first trimester paroxetine use in pregnancy and congenital malformations included the above-noted studies in addition to others (n = 17 studies  that included overall malformations and n = 14 studies that included cardiovascular  malformations; n = 20 distinct studies). While subject to limitations, this meta-analysis suggested an increased occurrence of cardiovascular malformations (prevalence odds ratio [POR] 1.5; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.9) and overall malformations (POR 1.2; 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 1.4) with paroxetine use during the first trimester. It was not possible in this meta-analysis to determine the extent to which the observed prevalence of cardiovascular malformations might have contributed to that of overall malformations, nor was it possible to determine whether any specific types of cardiovascular malformations might have contributed to the observed prevalence of all cardiovascular malformations.    </p>
<p>If a patient becomes pregnant while taking paroxetine, she should be advised of the potential harm to the fetus. Unless the benefits of paroxetine to the mother justify continuing treatment, consideration should be given to either discontinuing paroxetine therapy or switching to another antidepressant (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_471FA080-2874-DD56-3EDE-FA8ED06FA727">PRECAUTIONS: </a><a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_471FA080-2874-DD56-3EDE-FA8ED06FA727">Discontinuation of Treatment With Paroxetine</a>). For women who intend to become pregnant or are in their first trimester of pregnancy, paroxetine should only be initiated after consideration of the other available treatment options.   </p>
<p>Animal Findings</p>
<p>Reproduction studies were performed at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day in rats and 6 mg/kg/day in rabbits administered during organogenesis. These doses are approximately 8 (rat) and 2 (rabbit) times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on an mg/m2 basis. These studies have revealed no evidence of teratogenic effects. However, in rats, there was an increase in pup <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> during the first 4 days of lactation when dosing occurred during the last trimester of gestation and continued throughout lactation. This effect occurred at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day or approximately one-sixth of the MRHD on an mg/m2 basis. The no-effect dose for rat pup mortality was not determined. The cause of these <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> is not known.</p>
<p>Nonteratogenic Effects</p>
<p>Neonates exposed to paroxetine hydrochloride and other SSRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4158346" conceptname="Respiratory distress">respiratory distress</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438555" conceptname="Cyanosis">cyanosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">hypotonia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208994" conceptname="Increased muscle tone">hypertonia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4313132" conceptname="Hyperreflexia">hyperreflexia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436817" conceptname="Feeling nervous">jitteriness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, and constant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4136768" conceptname="Crying">crying</span>. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span> (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_7DC54B25-4FEC-BD4E-D55E-64872C6346CC">WARNINGS: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">Serotonin Syndrome</span></a>).</p>
<p>Infants exposed to SSRIs in pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322024" conceptname="Pulmonary hypertension">pulmonary hypertension</span> of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. Several recent epidemiologic studies suggest a positive statistical association between SSRI use (including paroxetine tablets, USP) in pregnancy and PPHN. Other studies do not show a significant statistical association.     </p>
<p>Physicians should also note the results of a prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4114950" conceptname="Endogenous depression">major depression</span>, who were either on antidepressants or had received antidepressants less than 12 weeks prior to their last menstrual period, and were in remission.

<p>When treating a pregnant woman with paroxetine tablets, the physician should carefully consider both the potential risks of taking an SSRI, along with the established benefits of treating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> with an antidepressant. This decision can only be made on a case by case basis (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_CB52CA1B-9E5C-4EE9-409E-70225180C0EB">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a> and <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_0A4013DB-7E48-5552-2F7C-B44B4DA4013D">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a>: <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_2240740F-F4CF-D15F-14B6-E503FB5E3128">Postmarketing Reports</a>). </p>

<p>Discontinuation of Treatment With Paroxetine</p>
<p>Recent clinical trials supporting the various approved indications for paroxetine employed a taper-phase regimen, rather than an abrupt discontinuation of treatment. The taper-phase regimen used in GAD clinical trials involved an incremental decrease in the daily dose by 10 mg/day at weekly intervals. When a daily dose of 20 mg/day was reached, patients were continued on this dose for 1 week before treatment was stopped.</p>
<p>With this regimen in those studies, the following adverse events were reported at an incidence of 2% or greater for paroxetine and were at least twice that reported for placebo: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4304251" conceptname="Bizarre dreams">Abnormal dreams</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4193492" conceptname="Acroparesthesia">paresthesia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>.

<p>During marketing of paroxetine and other SSRIs and SNRIs, there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon the discontinuation of these drugs (particularly when abrupt), including the following: Dysphoric mood, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4311114" conceptname="Sensory disorder">sensory disturbances</span> (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4193492" conceptname="Acroparesthesia">paresthesias</span> such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4193492" conceptname="Acroparesthesia">electric shock sensations</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377575" conceptname="Tinnitus">tinnitus</span>), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4061577" conceptname="Lethargy">lethargy</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4078201" conceptname="Mood swings">emotional lability</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333678" conceptname="Hypomania">hypomania</span>. While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms.</p>
<p>Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with paroxetine. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_CB52CA1B-9E5C-4EE9-409E-70225180C0EB">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>

<p>Tamoxifen</p>
<p>Some studies have shown that the efficacy of tamoxifen, as measured by the risk  of breast cancer relapse/mortality, may be reduced when co-prescribed with paroxetine as a  result of paroxetine’s irreversible inhibition of CYP2D6 (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_ABAA2F32-1552-4C00-CA79-B42E5E3A2AD2">Drug Interactions</a>).  However, other studies have failed to demonstrate such a risk. It is uncertain whether the coadministration of paroxetine and tamoxifen has a significant adverse effect on the efficacy of tamoxifen. One study suggests that the risk may increase with longer duration of coadministration. When tamoxifen is used for the treatment or prevention of breast cancer, prescribers should consider using an alternative antidepressant with little or no CYP2D6 inhibition.</p>

<p>Use in Patients With Concomitant Illness</p>
<p>Clinical experience with paroxetine in patients with certain concomitant systemic illness is limited. Caution is advisable in using paroxetine in patients with diseases or conditions that could affect metabolism or hemodynamic responses.</p>
<p>As with other SSRIs, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4290615" conceptname="Dilated pupil">mydriasis</span> has been infrequently reported in premarketing studies with paroxetine. A few cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432312" conceptname="Chronic angle-closure glaucoma">acute angle closure glaucoma</span> associated with paroxetine therapy have been reported in the literature.

<p>Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (e.g., NSAIDs, Aspirin, and Warfarin)</p>
<p>Patients should be cautioned about the concomitant use of paroxetine and NSAIDs, aspirin, warfarin, or other drugs that affect coagulation since combined use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and these agents has been associated with an increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>.</p>
<p>Interference With Cognitive and Motor Performance</p>
<p>Any psychoactive drug may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills. Although in controlled studies paroxetine has not been shown to impair psychomotor performance, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that therapy with paroxetine does not affect their ability to engage in such activities.</p>
<p>Completing Course of Therapy</p>
<p>While patients may notice improvement with treatment with paroxetine in 1 to 4 weeks, they should be advised to continue therapy as directed.</p>
<p>Concomitant Medication</p>
<p>Patients should be advised to inform their physician if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, since there is a potential for interactions.</p>
<p>Alcohol</p>
<p>Although paroxetine has not been shown to increase the impairment of mental and motor skills caused by alcohol, patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking paroxetine.</p>
<p>Pregnancy</p>
<p>Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_1E7F55FB-4E9E-CE77-B2B7-B78DB2FDD281">WARNINGS:</a><a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_1E7F55FB-4E9E-CE77-B2B7-B78DB2FDD281"> Usage in Pregnancy:</a><a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_1E7F55FB-4E9E-CE77-B2B7-B78DB2FDD281"> Teratogenic Effects </a> and <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_799918B4-28CC-8318-A9D2-CE2442B3F37A">Nonteratogenic Effects</a>).</p>

<p>Pimozide</p>
<p>In a controlled study of healthy volunteers, after paroxetine was titrated to 60 mg daily, co-administration of a single dose of 2 mg pimozide was associated with mean increases in pimozide AUC of 151% and Cmax of 62%, compared to pimozide administered alone. The increase in pimozide AUC and Cmax is due to the CYP2D6 inhibitory properties of paroxetine.  Due to the narrow therapeutic index of pimozide and its known ability to prolong the QT interval, concomitant use of pimozide and paroxetine is contraindicated (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_49158A19-DB4A-CA1C-9F32-848D196EBDF7">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>).</p>

<p>There have been rare postmarketing reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span> with the use of an SSRI and a triptan. If concomitant use of paroxetine with a triptan is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_7DC54B25-4FEC-BD4E-D55E-64872C6346CC">WARNINGS: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">Serotonin Syndrome</span></a>).</p>
<p>Drugs Affecting Hepatic Metabolism</p>
<p>The metabolism and pharmacokinetics of paroxetine may be affected by the induction or inhibition of drug-metabolizing enzymes.</p>
<p>Cimetidine</p>
<p>Cimetidine inhibits many cytochrome P450 (oxidative) enzymes. In a study where paroxetine (30 mg once daily) was dosed orally for 4 weeks, steady-state plasma concentrations of paroxetine were increased by approximately 50% during coadministration with oral cimetidine (300 mg three times daily) for the final week. Therefore, when these drugs are administered concurrently, dosage adjustment of paroxetine after the 20-mg starting dose should be guided by clinical effect. The effect of paroxetine on cimetidine's pharmacokinetics was not studied.</p>
<p>Phenobarbital</p>
<p>Phenobarbital induces many cytochrome P450 (oxidative) enzymes. When a single oral 30-mg dose of paroxetine was administered at phenobarbital steady state (100 mg once daily for 14 days), paroxetine AUC and T½ were reduced (by an average of 25% and 38%, respectively) compared to paroxetine administered alone. The effect of paroxetine on phenobarbital pharmacokinetics was not studied. Since paroxetine exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics, the results of this study may not address the case where the 2 drugs are both being chronically dosed. No initial dosage adjustment of paroxetine is considered necessary when coadministered with phenobarbital; any subsequent adjustment should be guided by clinical effect.</p>
<p>Phenytoin</p>
<p>When a single oral 30-mg dose of paroxetine was administered at phenytoin steady state (300 mg once daily for 14 days), paroxetine AUC and T½ were reduced (by an average of 50% and 35%, respectively) compared to paroxetine administered alone. In a separate study, when a single oral 300-mg dose of phenytoin was administered at paroxetine steady state (30 mg once daily for 14 days), phenytoin AUC was slightly reduced (12% on average) compared to phenytoin administered alone. Since both drugs exhibit nonlinear pharmacokinetics, the above studies may not address the case where the 2 drugs are both being chronically dosed. No initial dosage adjustments are considered necessary when these drugs are coadministered; any subsequent adjustments should be guided by clinical effect (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_2240740F-F4CF-D15F-14B6-E503FB5E3128">ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Reports</a>).</p>
<p>Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6</p>
<p>Many drugs, including most drugs effective in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (paroxetine, other SSRIs and many tricyclics), are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP2D6. Like other agents that are metabolized by CYP2D6, paroxetine may significantly inhibit the activity of this isozyme. In most patients (&gt;90%), this CYP2D6 isozyme is saturated early during dosing with paroxetine. In 1 study, daily dosing of paroxetine (20 mg once daily) under steady-state conditions increased single dose desipramine (100 mg) Cmax, AUC, and T½ by an average of approximately 2-, 5-, and 3-fold, respectively. Concomitant use of paroxetine with risperidone, a CYP2D6 substrate has also been evaluated. In 1 study, daily dosing of paroxetine 20 mg in patients stabilized on risperidone (4 to 8 mg/day) increased mean plasma concentrations of risperidone approximately 4-fold, decreased 9-hydroxyrisperidone concentrations approximately 10%, and increased concentrations of the active moiety (the sum of risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone) approximately 1.4-fold. The effect of paroxetine on the pharmacokinetics of atomoxetine has been evaluated when both drugs were at steady state. In healthy volunteers who were extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6, paroxetine 20 mg daily was given in combination with 20 mg atomoxetine every 12 hours. This resulted in increases in steady state atomoxetine AUC values that were 6- to 8-fold greater and in atomoxetine Cmax values that were 3- to 4-fold greater than when atomoxetine was given alone. Dosage adjustment of atomoxetine may be necessary and it is recommended that atomoxetine be initiated at a reduced dose when it is given with paroxetine.</p>
<p>Concomitant use of paroxetine with other drugs metabolized by cytochrome CYP2D6 has not been formally studied but may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either paroxetine or the other drug.</p>
<p>Therefore, coadministration of paroxetine with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including certain drugs effective in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (e.g., nortriptyline, amitriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, and fluoxetine), phenothiazines, risperidone, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.</p>
<p>However, due to the risk of serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4132309" conceptname="Sudden death">sudden death</span> potentially associated with elevated plasma levels of thioridazine, paroxetine and thioridazine should not be coadministered (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_49158A19-DB4A-CA1C-9F32-848D196EBDF7">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a> and <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_43D3F4B6-1241-968E-D33D-EEB9737A9D17">WARNINGS</a>).</p>
<p>Tamoxifen is a pro-drug requiring metabolic activation by CYP2D6. Inhibition of CYP2D6 by paroxetine may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of an active metabolite (endoxifen) and hence reduced efficacy of tamoxifen (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_4FF5DBBC-18A8-25DE-4CFE-A55D63D25A84">PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>
<p>At steady state, when the CYP2D6 pathway is essentially saturated, paroxetine clearance is governed by alternative P450 isozymes that, unlike CYP2D6, show no evidence of saturation (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_43B2F5D8-0F35-F4FC-D11A-318885931F63">PRECAUTIONS: </a><a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_43B2F5D8-0F35-F4FC-D11A-318885931F63">Tricyclic Antidepressants </a><a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_43B2F5D8-0F35-F4FC-D11A-318885931F63">[TCAs]</a>).</p>
<p>Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome CYP3A4</p>
<p>An in vivo interaction study involving the coadministration under steady-state conditions of paroxetine and terfenadine, a substrate for cytochrome CYP3A4, revealed no effect of paroxetine on terfenadine pharmacokinetics. In addition, in vitro studies have shown ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity, to be at least 100 times more potent than paroxetine as an inhibitor of the metabolism of several substrates for this enzyme, including terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, triazolam, and cyclosporine. Based on the assumption that the relationship between paroxetine’s in vitro Ki and its lack of effect on terfenadine’s in vivo clearance predicts its effect on other CYP3A4 substrates, paroxetine’s extent of inhibition of CYP3A4 activity is not likely to be of clinical significance.</p>
<p>Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)</p>
<p>Caution is indicated in the coadministration of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) with paroxetine, because paroxetine may inhibit TCA metabolism. Plasma TCA concentrations may need to be monitored, and the dose of TCA may need to be reduced, if a TCA is coadministered with paroxetine (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_EB6A5107-B86F-F470-348B-CF35F9F9A0CA">PRECAUTIONS</a>: <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_EB6A5107-B86F-F470-348B-CF35F9F9A0CA">Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome CYP2D6</a>).</p>
<p>Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein</p>
<p>Because paroxetine is highly bound to plasma protein, administration of paroxetine to a patient taking another drug that is highly protein bound may cause increased free concentrations of the other drug, potentially resulting in adverse events. Conversely, adverse effects could result from displacement of paroxetine by other highly bound drugs.</p>
<p>Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (e.g., NSAIDs, Aspirin, and Warfarin)</p>
<p>Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">gastrointestinal bleeding</span> have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin  may potentiate this risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>.  Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, have been reported when SSRIs or SNRIs are coadministered with warfarin. Patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when paroxetine is initiated or discontinued.</p>
<p>Alcohol</p>
<p>Although paroxetine does not increase the impairment of mental and motor skills caused by alcohol, patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking paroxetine.</p>
<p>Lithium</p>
<p>A multiple-dose study has shown that there is no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interaction</span> between paroxetine and lithium carbonate. However, due to the potential for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span>, caution is advised when paroxetine is coadministered with lithium.</p>
<p>Digoxin</p>
<p>The steady-state pharmacokinetics of paroxetine was not altered when administered with digoxin at steady state. Mean digoxin AUC at steady state decreased by 15% in the presence of paroxetine. Since there is little clinical experience, the concurrent administration of paroxetine and digoxin should be undertaken with caution.</p>
<p>Diazepam</p>
<p>Under steady-state conditions, diazepam does not appear to affect paroxetine kinetics. The effects of paroxetine on diazepam were not evaluated.</p>
<p>Procyclidine</p>
<p>Daily oral dosing of paroxetine (30 mg once daily) increased steady-state AUC0-24, Cmax, and Cmin values of procyclidine (5 mg oral once daily) by 35%, 37% and 67%, respectively, compared to procyclidine alone at steady state. If anticholinergic effects are seen, the dose of procyclidine should be reduced.</p>
<p>Beta-Blockers</p>
<p>In a study where propranolol (80 mg twice daily) was dosed orally for 18 days, the established steady-state plasma concentrations of propranolol were unaltered during coadministration with paroxetine (30 mg once daily) for the final 10 days. The effects of propranolol on paroxetine have not been evaluated (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_2240740F-F4CF-D15F-14B6-E503FB5E3128">ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Reports</a>).</p>
<p>Theophylline</p>
<p>Reports of elevated theophylline levels associated with treatment with paroxetine have been reported. While this interaction has not been formally studied, it is recommended that theophylline levels be monitored when these drugs are concurrently administered.</p>
<p>Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir</p>
<p>Co-administration of fosamprenavir/ritonavir with paroxetine significantly decreased plasma levels of paroxetine. Any dose adjustment should be guided by clinical effect (tolerability and efficacy).</p>
<p>Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)</p>
<p>There are no clinical studies of the combined use of ECT and paroxetine.</p>
<p>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of FertilityCarcinogenesis</p>
<p>Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted in rodents given paroxetine in the diet at 1, 5, and 25 mg/kg/day (mice) and 1, 5, and 20 mg/kg/day (rats). These doses are up to 2.4 (mouse) and 3.9 (rat) times the MRHD for major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span>, and GAD on a mg/m2 basis. Because the MRHD for major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> is slightly less than that for OCD (50 mg versus 60 mg), the doses used in these carcinogenicity studies were only 2.0 (mouse) and 3.2 (rat) times the MRHD for OCD. There was a significantly greater number of male rats in the high-dose group with reticulum cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084784" conceptname="Sarcoma">sarcomas</span> (1/100, 0/50, 0/50, and 4/50 for control, low-, middle-, and high-dose groups, respectively) and a significantly increased linear trend across dose groups for the occurrence of lymphoreticular tumors in male rats. Female rats were not affected. Although there was a dose-related increase in the number of tumors in mice, there was no drug-related increase in the number of mice with tumors. The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown.</p>
<p>Mutagenesis</p>
<p>Paroxetine produced no genotoxic effects in a battery of 5 in vitro and 2 in vivo assays that included the following: Bacterial mutation assay, mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> mutation assay, unscheduled DNA synthesis assay, and tests for cytogenetic aberrations in vivo in mouse bone marrow and in vitro in human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span> and in a dominant lethal test in rats.</p>
<p>Impairment of Fertility</p>
<p>Some clinical studies have shown that SSRIs (including paroxetine) may affect sperm quality during SSRI treatment, which may affect fertility in some men.</p>
<p>A reduced pregnancy rate was found in reproduction studies in rats at a dose of paroxetine of 15 mg/kg/day, which is 2.9 times the MRHD for major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span>, and GAD or 2.4 times the MRHD for OCD on a mg/m2 basis. Irreversible lesions occurred in the reproductive tract of male rats after dosing in toxicity studies for 2 to 52 weeks. These lesions consisted of vacuolation of epididymal tubular epithelium at 50 mg/kg/day and atrophic changes in the seminiferous tubules of the testes with arrested spermatogenesis at 25 mg/kg/day (9.8 and 4.9 times the MRHD for major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span>, and GAD; 8.2 and 4.1 times the MRHD for OCD and PD on a mg/m2 basis).</p>

<p>Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials</p>
<p>The prescriber should be aware that the figures in the tables following cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side effect incidence rate in the populations studied.</p>

<p>Table 2 enumerates adverse events that occurred at an incidence of 1% or more among paroxetine-treated patients who participated in short-term (6-week) placebo-controlled trials in which patients were dosed in a range of 20 mg to 50 mg/day. Reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based Dictionary terminology.</p>

<p>Adaptation to Certain Adverse Events</p>
<p>Over a 4- to 6-week period, there was evidence of adaptation to some adverse events with continued therapy (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>), but less to other effects (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226991" conceptname="Aptyalism">dry mouth</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">asthenia</span>).</p>
<p>Male and Female <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4237140" conceptname="Abnormal sexual function">Sexual Dysfunction</span> With SSRIs</p>
<p>Although changes in sexual desire, sexual performance, and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder, they may also be a consequence of pharmacologic treatment. In particular, some evidence suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can cause such untoward sexual experiences.</p>
<p>Reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance, and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, however, in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in product labeling, are likely to underestimate their actual incidence.</p>
<p>In placebo-controlled clinical trials involving more than 3,200 patients, the ranges for the reported incidence of sexual side effects in males and females with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, OCD, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span>, and GAD are displayed in Table 6.</p>

<p>Significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> may be an undesirable result of treatment with paroxetine for some patients but, on average, patients in controlled trials had minimal (about 1 pound) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> versus smaller changes on placebo and active control.

Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories.</p>
<p>In the tabulations that follow, reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based Dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 9,089 patients exposed to multiple doses of paroxetine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least 1 occasion while receiving paroxetine. All reported events are included except those already listed in Tables 2 to 5, those reported in terms so general as to be uninformative and those events where a drug cause was remote. It is important to emphasize that although the events reported occurred during treatment with paroxetine, they were not necessarily caused by it.</p>
<p>Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: Frequent adverse events are those occurring on 1 or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled trials appear in this listing); infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Events of major clinical importance are also described in the <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_4FF5DBBC-18A8-25DE-4CFE-A55D63D25A84">PRECAUTIONS</a> section.</p>

<p>Paroxetine has not been systematically studied in animals or humans for its potential for abuse, tolerance or physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>. While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency for any drug-seeking behavior, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed. Consequently, patients should be evaluated carefully for history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed closely for signs of misuse or abuse of paroxetine (e.g., development of tolerance, incrementations of dose, drug-seeking behavior).</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE SECTION<span class="Bold"></span>
</h1>
<p class="First">Human Experience</p>
<p>Since the introduction of paroxetine in the United States, 342 spontaneous cases of deliberate or accidental overdosage during paroxetine treatment have been reported worldwide (circa 1999). These include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> with paroxetine alone and in combination with other substances. Of these, 48 cases were fatal and of the fatalities, 17 appeared to involve paroxetine alone. Eight fatal cases that documented the amount of paroxetine ingested were generally confounded by the ingestion of other drugs or alcohol or the presence of significant comorbid conditions. Of 145 non-fatal cases with known outcome, most recovered without sequelae. The largest known ingestion involved 2,000 mg of paroxetine (33 times the maximum recommended daily dose) in a patient who recovered.</p>

<p>Overdosage Management</p>
<p>No specific antidotes for paroxetine are known.Treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any drugs effective in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>.</p>
<p>Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. General supportive and symptomatic measures are also recommended. Induction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> is not recommended. Due to the large volume of distribution of this drug, forced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span>, dialysis, hemoperfusion, or exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit.</p>
<p>A specific caution involves patients who are taking or have recently taken paroxetine who might ingest excessive quantities of a tricyclic antidepressant. In such a case, accumulation of the parent tricyclic and/or an active metabolite may increase the possibility of clinically significant sequelae and extend the time needed for close medical observation (see PRECAUTIONS: Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome CYP2D6).</p>
<p>In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement. The physician should consider contacting a poison control center for additional information on the treatment of any <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. Telephone numbers for certified poison control centers are listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR).</p>

<h1>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION SECTION</h1>
<p class="First">Major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depressive Disorder</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Usual Initial Dosage</p>
<p>Paroxetine should be administered as a single daily dose with or without food, usually in the morning. The recommended initial dose is 20 mg/day. Patients were dosed in a range of 20 to 50 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>. As with all drugs effective in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, the full effect may be delayed. Some patients not responding to a 20-mg dose may benefit from dose increases, in 10-mg/day increments, up to a maximum of 50 mg/day. Dose changes should occur at intervals of at least 1 week.</p>
<p>Maintenance Therapy</p>
<p>There is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with paroxetine should remain on it. It is generally agreed that acute episodes of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> require several months or longer of sustained pharmacologic therapy. Whether the dose needed to induce remission is identical to the dose needed to maintain and/or sustain euthymia is unknown.</p>
<p>Systematic evaluation of the efficacy of paroxetine has shown that efficacy is maintained for periods of up to 1 year with doses that averaged about 30 mg.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440374" conceptname="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">Obsessive Compulsive Disorder</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Usual Initial Dosage</p>
<p>Paroxetine should be administered as a single daily dose with or without food, usually in the morning. The recommended dose of paroxetine in the treatment of OCD is 40 mg daily. Patients should be started on 20 mg/day and the dose can be increased in 10-mg/day increments. Dose changes should occur at intervals of at least 1 week. Patients were dosed in a range of 20 to 60 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of OCD. The maximum dosage should not exceed 60 mg/day.</p>
<p>Maintenance Therapy</p>
<p>Long-term maintenance of efficacy was demonstrated in a 6-month relapse prevention trial. In this trial, patients with OCD assigned to paroxetine demonstrated a lower relapse rate compared to patients on placebo (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_B643AA0D-BCAD-CB26-AC86-6BE333846CA0">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Trials</a>). OCD is a chronic condition, and it is reasonable to consider continuation for a responding patient. Dosage adjustments should be made to maintain the patient on the lowest effective dosage, and patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for continued treatment.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Usual Initial Dosage</p>
<p>Paroxetine should be administered as a single daily dose with or without food, usually in the morning. The target dose of paroxetine in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> is 40 mg/day. Patients should be started on 10 mg/day. Dose changes should occur in 10-mg/day increments and at intervals of at least 1 week. Patients were dosed in a range of 10 to 60 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of paroxetine. The maximum dosage should not exceed 60 mg/day.</p>
<p>Maintenance Therapy</p>
<p>Long-term maintenance of efficacy was demonstrated in a 3-month relapse prevention trial. In this trial, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> assigned to paroxetine demonstrated a lower relapse rate compared to patients on placebo (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_B643AA0D-BCAD-CB26-AC86-6BE333846CA0">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Trials</a>). <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">Panic disorder</span> is a chronic condition, and it is reasonable to consider continuation for a responding patient.

<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">Social Anxiety Disorder</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Usual Initial Dosage</p>
<p>Paroxetine should be administered as a single daily dose with or without food, usually in the morning. The recommended and initial dosage is 20 mg/day. In clinical trials the effectiveness of paroxetine was demonstrated in patients dosed in a range of 20 to 60 mg/day. While the safety of paroxetine has been evaluated in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span> at doses up to 60 mg/day, available information does not suggest any additional benefit for doses above 20 mg/day (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_B643AA0D-BCAD-CB26-AC86-6BE333846CA0">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Trials</a>).</p>
<p>Maintenance Therapy</p>
<p>There is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with paroxetine should remain on it. Although the efficacy of paroxetine beyond 12 weeks of dosing has not been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span> is recognized as a chronic condition, and it is reasonable to consider continuation of treatment for a responding patient. Dosage adjustments should be made to maintain the patient on the lowest effective dosage, and patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for continued treatment.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434613" conceptname="Generalized anxiety disorder">Generalized Anxiety Disorder</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Usual Initial Dosage</p>
<p>Paroxetine should be administered as a single daily dose with or without food, usually in the morning. In clinical trials the effectiveness of paroxetine was demonstrated in patients dosed in a range of 20 to 50 mg/day. The recommended starting dosage and the established effective dosage is 20 mg/day. There is not sufficient evidence to suggest a greater benefit to doses higher than 20 mg/day. Dose changes should occur in 10 mg/day increments and at intervals of at least 1 week.</p>
<p>Maintenance Therapy</p>
<p>Systematic evaluation of continuing paroxetine for periods of up to 24 weeks in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434613" conceptname="Generalized anxiety disorder">Generalized Anxiety Disorder</span> who had responded while taking paroxetine during an 8-week acute treatment phase has demonstrated a benefit of such maintenance (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_B643AA0D-BCAD-CB26-AC86-6BE333846CA0">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Trials</a>). Nevertheless, patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment.</p>
<p>Special PopulationsTreatment of Pregnant Women During the Third Trimester</p>
<p>Neonates exposed to paroxetine and other SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_43D3F4B6-1241-968E-D33D-EEB9737A9D17">WARNINGS: Usage in Pregnancy</a>). When treating pregnant women with paroxetine during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment.</p>
<p>Dosage for Elderly or Debilitated Patients, and Patients With Severe Renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic Impairment</span></p>
<p>The recommended initial dose is 10 mg/day for elderly patients, debilitated patients, and/or patients with severe renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>. Increases may be made if indicated. Dosage should not exceed 40 mg/day.</p>
<p>Switching a Patient to or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Intended to Treat Psychiatric Disorders:</p>
<p>At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with paroxetine Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping paroxetine before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_49158A19-DB4A-CA1C-9F32-848D196EBDF7">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>).</p>
<p>Use of Paroxetine With Other MAOIs, Such as Linezolid or Methylene Blue</p>
<p>Do not start paroxetine tablets in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue because there is increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span>. In a patient who requires more urgent treatment of a psychiatric condition, other interventions, including hospitalization, should be considered (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_49158A19-DB4A-CA1C-9F32-848D196EBDF7">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>).</p>
<p> In some cases, a patient already receiving therapy with paroxetine tablets may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span> in a particular patient, paroxetine tablets should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered. The patient should be monitored for symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span> for 2 weeks or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, whichever comes first. Therapy with paroxetine tablets may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_43D3F4B6-1241-968E-D33D-EEB9737A9D17">WARNINGS</a>).</p>
<p>The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg/kg with paroxetine is unclear. The clinician should, nevertheless, be aware of the possibility of emergent symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span> with such use (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_43D3F4B6-1241-968E-D33D-EEB9737A9D17">WARNINGS</a>).</p>
<p>Discontinuation of Treatment With Paroxetine</p>
<p>Symptoms associated with discontinuation of paroxetine have been reported (see <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_4FF5DBBC-18A8-25DE-4CFE-A55D63D25A84">PRECAUTIONS: </a><a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?ndc=60505-0097-1&amp;start=1&amp;labeltype=all#_4FF5DBBC-18A8-25DE-4CFE-A55D63D25A84">Discontinuation of Treatment With Paroxetine</a>). Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment, regardless of the indication for which paroxetine is being prescribed. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate.</p>

<h1>PATIENT MEDICATION INFORMATION SECTION</h1>
<p class="First">Paroxetine Tablets, USP</p>
<p>(pa rox’ e teen)</p>
<p>Read the Medication Guide that comes with paroxetine before you start taking it and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This Medication Guide does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment.
