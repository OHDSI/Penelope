<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">The active ingredient of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution, USP is cromolyn sodium, USP. It is an inhaled anti-inflammatory agent for the preventive management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>. Cromolyn sodium is chemically designated as disodium 5,5'- [(2-hydroxytrimethylene)dioxy] bis [4-oxo-4<span class="Italics">H</span>-1-benzopyran-2-carboxylate]. The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">23</span>H<span class="Sub">1</span><span class="Sub">4</span>Na<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">11</span>; the molecular weight is 512.34. Cromolyn sodium is a water-soluble, odorless, white, hydrated crystalline powder. It is tasteless at first, but leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste. Cromolyn sodium is clear, colorless to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260836" conceptname="Blanching of skin">pale</span> yellow, sterile and has a target pH of 5.5.</p>
<p>The structural formula is:</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> animal studies have shown that cromolyn sodium inhibits sensitized mast cell degranulation which occurs after exposure to specific antigens. Cromolyn sodium acts by inhibiting the release of mediators from mast cells. Studies show that cromolyn sodium indirectly blocks calcium ions from entering the mast cell, thereby preventing mediator release.</p>
<p>Cromolyn sodium inhibits both the immediate and non-immediate bronchoconstrictive reactions to inhaled antigen. Cromolyn sodium also attenuates <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256717" conceptname="Bronchospasm">bronchospasm</span> caused by exercise, toluene diisocyanate, aspirin, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">cold</span> air, sulfur dioxide and environmental pollutants.</p>
<p>Cromolyn sodium has no intrinsic bronchodilator or antihistaminic activity.</p>
<p>After administration by inhalation, approximately 8% of the total cromolyn sodium dose administered is absorbed and rapidly excreted unchanged, approximately equally divided between urine and bile. The remainder of the dose is either exhaled or deposited in the oropharynx, swallowed and excreted via the alimentary tract.</p>

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Cromolyn sodium is to be taken as directed by the physician. Because it is preventive medication, it may take up to four weeks before the patient experiences maximum benefit.</p>
<p>Cromolyn sodium should be used in a power-driven nebulizer with an adequate airflow rate equipped with a suitable face mask or mouthpiece.</p>
<p>Drug stability and safety of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Long-term studies of cromolyn sodium in mice (12 months intraperitoneal administration at doses up to 150 mg/kg three days per week), hamsters (intraperitoneal administration at doses up to 53 mg/kg three days per week for 15 weeks followed by 17.5 mg/kg three days per week for 37 weeks), and rats (18 months subcutaneous treatment at doses up to 75 mg/kg six days per week) showed no neoplastic effects. These doses correspond to approximately 1.0, 0.3, and 2 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p>
<p>Cromolyn sodium showed no mutagenic potential in Ames <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span>/microsome plate assays, mitotic gene conversion in <span class="Italics">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> and an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> cytogenetic study in human peripheral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span>.</p>
<p>No evidence of impaired fertility was shown in laboratory reproduction studies conducted subcutaneously in rats at the highest doses tested, 175 mg/kg/day in males and 100 mg/kg/day in females. These doses are approximately 18 and 10 times, respectively, the maximum recommended adult human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p>

<h4>Pregnancy Category B</h4>
<p class="First">Reproduction studies with cromolyn sodium administered subcutaneously to pregnant mice and rats at maximum daily doses of 540 mg/kg and 164 mg/kg, respectively, and intravenously to rabbits at a maximum daily dose of 485 mg/kg produced no evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079975" conceptname="Congenital malformation">fetal malformations</span>. These doses represent approximately 27, 17, and 98 times, respectively, the maximum recommended adult human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. Adverse fetal effects (increased resorption and decreased fetal weight) were noted only at the very high parenteral doses that produced maternal toxicity. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.</p>
<p>Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p>

<h2>Drug Interaction During Pregnancy</h2>
<p class="First">Cromolyn sodium and isoproterenol were studied following subcutaneous injections in pregnant mice. Cromolyn sodium alone in doses up to 540 mg/kg (approximately 27 times the maximum recommended adult human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) did not cause significant increases in resorptions or major malformations. Isoproterenol alone at a dose of 2.7 mg/kg (approximately 7 times the maximum recommended adult human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) increased both resorptions and malformations. The addition of cromolyn sodium (approximately 27 times the maximum recommended adult human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) to isoproterenol (approximately 7 times the maximum recommended adult human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) appears to have increased the incidence of both resorptions and malformations.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Clinical experience with the use of cromolyn sodium suggests that adverse reactions are rare events. The following adverse reactions have been associated with cromolyn sodium : <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4195085" conceptname="Nasal congestion">nasal congestion</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4328356" conceptname="Sneezing">sneezing</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314754" conceptname="Wheezing">wheezing</span>.</p>
<p>Other reactions have been reported in clinical trials; however, a causal relationship could not be established: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, nasal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302654" conceptname="Itching">itching</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318556" conceptname="Epistaxis">nose bleed</span>, nose burning, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432522" conceptname="Transfusion reaction due to serum protein reaction">serum sickness</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194175" conceptname="Left upper quadrant pain">stomachache</span>.</p>
<p>In addition, adverse reactions have been reported with cromolyn sodium for inhalation, USP capsules. The most common side effects are associated with inhalation of the powder and include transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> (1 in 5 patients) and mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314754" conceptname="Wheezing">wheezing</span> (1 in 25 patients). These effects rarely require treatment or discontinuation of the drug.</p>
<p>Information on the incidence of adverse reactions to cromolyn sodium for inhalation, USP capsules has been derived from U.S. postmarketing surveillance experience. The following adverse reactions attributed to cromolyn sodium, based upon recurrence following readministration, have been reported in less than 1 in 10,000 patients: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="22350" conceptname="Edema of larynx">laryngeal edema</span>, swollen parotid gland, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432791" conceptname="Angioedema">angioedema</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256717" conceptname="Bronchospasm">bronchospasm</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154927" conceptname="Joint swelling">joint swelling</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197684" conceptname="Dysuria">dysuria</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012368" conceptname="Increased frequency of urination">urinary frequency</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314754" conceptname="Wheezing">wheezing</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4195085" conceptname="Nasal congestion">nasal congestion</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="139900" conceptname="Urticaria">urticaria</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435553" conceptname="Epiphora">lacrimation</span>.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">There is no clinical syndrome associated with an overdosage of cromolyn sodium. Acute toxicity testing in a wide variety of species has demonstrated that toxicity with cromolyn sodium occurs only with very high exposure levels, regardless of whether administration was parenteral, oral or by inhalation. Parenteral administration in mice, rats, guinea pigs, hamsters and rabbits demonstrated a median lethal dose of approximately 4000 mg/kg. Intravenous administration in monkeys also indicated a similar pattern of toxicity. The highest dose administered by the oral route in rats and mice was 8000 mg/kg, (approximately 261 and 130 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) and at this dose level no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> occurred. By inhalation, even in long term studies, it proved impossible to achieve toxic dose levels of cromolyn sodium in a range of mammalian species.</p>

<p class="First">For management of bronchial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> in adults and pediatric patients (two years of age and over), the usual starting dosage is the contents of one vial administered by nebulization four times a day at regular intervals.</p>
<p>Drug stability and safety of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established.</p>
<p>Patients with chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> should be advised that the effect of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution, USP therapy is dependent upon its administration at regular intervals, as directed. Cromolyn sodium inhalation solution, USP should be introduced into the patient's therapeutic regimen when the acute episode has been controlled, the airway has been cleared and the patient is able to inhale adequately.</p>

<h3>Non-steroidal agents</h3>
<p class="First">Cromolyn sodium inhalation solution, USP should be <span class="Italics">added</span> to the patient's existing treatment regimen (e.g., bronchodilators). When a clinical response to cromolyn sodium inhalation solution, USP is evident, usually within two to four weeks, and if the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> is under good control, an attempt may be made to decrease concomitant medication usage gradually.</p>
<p>If concomitant medications are eliminated or required on no more than a prn basis, the frequency of administration of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution, USP may be titrated downward to the lowest level consistent with the desired effect. The usual decrease is from four to three vials per day. It is important that the dosage be reduced gradually to avoid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="257581" conceptname="Exacerbation of asthma">exacerbation of asthma</span>. It is emphasized that in patients whose dosage has been titrated to fewer than four vials per day, an increase in the dose of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution, USP and the introduction of, or increase in, symptomatic medications may be needed if the patient's clinical condition deteriorates.</p>

<h3>Corticosteroids</h3>
<p class="First">In patients chronically receiving corticosteroids for the management of bronchial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>, the dosage should be maintained following the introduction of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution, USP. If the patient improves, an attempt to decrease corticosteroids should be made. Even if the corticosteroid-dependent patient fails to show symptomatic improvement following cromolyn sodium inhalation solution, USP administration, the potential to reduce corticosteroids may nonetheless be present. Thus, gradual tapering of corticosteroid dosage may be attempted. It is important that the dose be reduced slowly, maintaining close supervision of the patient to avoid an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="257581" conceptname="Exacerbation of asthma">exacerbation of asthma</span>.</p>
<p>It should be borne in mind that prolonged corticosteroid therapy frequently causes an impairment in the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and a reduction in the size of the adrenal cortex. A potentially critical degree of impairment or insufficiency may persist asymptomatically for some time even after gradual discontinuation of adrenocortical steroids. Therefore, if a patient is subjected to significant stress, such as a severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatic attack</span>, surgery, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433633" conceptname="Late effect of superficial injury">trauma</span> or severe illness while being treated or within one year (occasionally up to two years) after corticosteroid treatment has been terminated, consideration should be given to reinstituting corticosteroid therapy. When respiratory function is impaired, as may occur in severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="257581" conceptname="Exacerbation of asthma">exacerbation of asthma</span>, a temporary increase in the amount of corticosteroids may be required to regain control of the patient's <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>.</p>
<p>It is particularly important that great care be exercised if, for any reason, cromolyn sodium inhalation solution, USP is withdrawn in cases where its use has permitted a reduction in the maintenance dose of corticosteroids. In such cases, continued close supervision of the patient is essential since there may be sudden reappearance of severe manifestations of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> which will require immediate therapy and possible reintroduction of corticosteroids.</p>

<p>You or your child may be among the millions of Americans who have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>. For most patients, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> need not limit your lifestyle, if you closely follow the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> management plan your doctor provides you.

<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">Asthma</span> is a disease that causes patients to have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">difficulty breathing</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">Asthma</span> â€œattacksâ€?</p>
<p>occur when the air passages (airways) to the lungs close up, blocking air from</p>
<p>passing through. The closing up is caused by two things:</p>
<p>1. The muscles around the airways tighten (constrict) making the airway narrower, and</p>
<p>2. The passage lining swells and produces larger amounts of mucus (a sticky liquid normally found in airways). This <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span> is caused by a certain type of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> that can build up in the airways of patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">Inflammation</span> and the airway sensitivity that results from it cause further attacks to occur.</p>

<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">Asthma</span> experts know that patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> have attacks because their airways are inflamed and over reactive. Their lungs become super-sensitive to certain irritants or â€œtriggersâ€?, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">cold</span> dry air, pollen, smoke, or cat dander. In the presence of such triggers, someone with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> may have an attack, and attacks may occur more often.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">HOW TO PREVENT <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">ASTHMA</span> ATTACKS</span></p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="image-4" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=8fe37a7a-edd6-4733-bb7e-e01c1906aeba&amp;name=1d16436b-c7df-4832-9e8f-552a7ef031e2-05.jpg"></div>
<p>No medicine or procedure will â€œcureâ€? <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>. The key to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> relief, therefore, is to <span class="Italics">prevent </span>attacks and to relieve attack symptoms if they do occur.</p>
<p>A successful prevention plan* will do the following:</p>
<p>1. Keep your activities, including exercise, at normal levels.</p>
<p>2. Keep your lungs functioning normally or at a near-normal level.</p>
<p>3. Prevent symptoms such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">coughing</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">breathlessness</span> that can keep you up at night, or occur in the early morning hours, or after exertion.</p>
<p>4. Prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> attacks from happening.</p>
<p>5. Avoid unpleasant or harmful side effects that may result from using <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> medicine.</p>
<p>The best way to prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> attacks is to avoid the triggers that bother you or your child. Try to identify the specific things that cause problems for you - things such as certain foods, house dust, or animal dander. Avoiding these triggers may be difficult or unpleasant. You may need to find a new home for a family pet or remove a carpet or a favorite stuffed toy. Even though these steps are difficult, they may be necessary in order to help prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> attacks.</p>
<p>If house dust is a trigger, remove dust-collectors such as feather pillows, mattresses, quilts, and carpets from the bedroom. Mattresses and pillows can be covered with allergen-free covers. If a certain food triggers attacks, keep it out of your diet. Irritants in the air can be reduced by air conditioning, electrostatic air filters, or small-pore (HEPA) filters. Be careful of certain medicines. Aspirin and aspirin-like <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relievers, for example, can trigger attacks in some people and should be avoided if they do.</p>

<p>2. Avoid fresh paint.</p>
<p>3. Avoid sudden changes of temperature. Donâ€™t go in and out of extremely cool air-conditioned buildings during hot weather.</p>
<p>4. Stay home in extremely <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">cold</span> weather, if possible.</p>
<p>5. Stay away from people with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">cold</span> or flu.</p>
<p>6. Try to avoid emotionally upsetting situations.</p>
<p>7. Drink lots of liquids.</p>
<p>8. Donâ€™t overdo, but follow a regular exercise plan, including activities that help develop lung capacity.</p>
<p>9. Donâ€™t take any medicine on your own without asking your doctor first.</p>
<p>10. Take all medicines your doctor prescribes, as much and as often as you are told.</p>
<p>11. Avoid taking sleeping pills or sedatives, even if <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> keeps you awake. Prop yourself up with extra pillows until your <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> medicine takes effect.</p>
<p>12. Avoid breathing in insecticides, deodorants, cleaning fluids, chlorine, or other irritating gases.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">Preventive Medicine</span></p>
<p>Your doctor knows that, besides relieving an attack when it happens, it is also important to prevent attacks from occurring in the first place. Therefore, he or she has prescribed for you cromolyn sodium, a medicine that prevents <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> attacks by making airways less sensitive to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> triggers. It works by stabilizing cells in the airway lining called mast cells. During an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> attack, these cells become unstable and give off chemicals called mediators that cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> attacks.</p>
<p>By preventing mediator release, cromolyn sodium works to prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> attacks.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Bronchodilators</span></p>
<p>When someone is having an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> attack, he or she needs a medicine called a bronchodilator to open up (dilate) the blocked airways in order to relieve <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> attacks. Your doctor may have already prescribed this medicine for you to use at that time.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">HOW WILL CROMOLYN SODIUM WORK FOR YOU?</span></p>
<p>To get the best possible results, follow your doctorâ€™s instructions carefully when you first take cromolyn sodium.</p>
<p>Your doctor may tell you to take cromolyn sodium 10 to 15 minutes before you exercise or come into contact with a specific trigger, such as a cat. Usually, however, you will be told to take cromolyn sodium on a regular basis, probably starting at four times a day. <span class="Bold">It is crucial that you take cromolyn sodium,</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">regularly</span>, as often as your doctor recommends, even though you have no</span><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> symptoms at the time. </span>Cromolyn sodium starts working right away but when you first begin taking it, you may have a lot of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> in your airways. Therefore, it may take up to two weeks (or perhaps one month) of regular treatment to bring your <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> under control. Do not stop taking cromolyn sodium or skip any doses without first talking with your doctor.</p>
<p>When you start using cromolyn sodium for the first time, your doctor may ask you to keep a diary showing when you have any symptoms, if and when you have trouble sleeping, how often you <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314754" conceptname="Wheezing">wheeze</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span>, and other notes to help determine how effective cromolyn sodium will be to help you <span class="Italics">prevent </span><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> attacks. Your doctor may also recommend the use of a peak flow meter daily to help you better assess your progress.</p>
<p>While taking cromolyn sodium on a regular basis, you may need to take a bronchodilator-type medicine to treat occasional symptoms or attacks. While taking cromolyn sodium, you should continue taking your other medications until your doctor advises you otherwise.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">For best results, follow these instructions exactly and observe Care and Storage directions.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION</span></p>
<p>Cromolyn sodium inhalation solution is recommended for use in a power driven nebulizer operated at an airflow rate of 6-8 liters per minute and equipped with a suitable face mask. Hand operated nebulizers are not suitable for the administration of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution. Your doctor will advise on the choice of a suitable nebulizer and how it should be used. Do not use any appliance without consulting your doctor.</p>
<p>Drug stability and safety of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">DOSAGE</span></p>
<p>Nebulization should be carried out four times a day at regular intervals, or as directed by your doctor. Use the contents of a fresh vial each time.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">INHALATION</span></p>
<p>Once the nebulizer has been assembled and contains cromolyn sodium inhalation solution, hold the mask close to the patientâ€™s face and switch on the device. The patient should breathe in through the mouth and out through the nose in a normal, relaxed manner. Nebulization should take approximately five to ten minutes.</p>
