STUDIES IN PATIENTS OF CHINESE ANCESTRY HAVE FOUND A STRONG ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE RISK OF DEVELOPING SJS/TEN AND THE PRESENCE OF HLA-B*1502, AN INHERITED ALLELIC VARIANT OF THE HLA-B GENE. HLA-B*1502 IS FOUND ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN PATIENTS WITH ANCESTRY ACROSS BROAD AREAS OF ASIA. PATIENTS WITH ANCESTRY IN GENETICALLY AT-RISK POPULATIONS SHOULD BE SCREENED FOR THE PRESENCE OF HLA-B*1502 PRIOR TO INITIATING TREATMENT WITH TEGRETOL.

<h2><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></h2>
<p class="First">Tegretol has demonstrated anticonvulsant properties in rats and mice with electrically and chemically induced <span class='product-label-link' type='condition' conceptid='377091' conceptname='Seizure'>seizure</span>s. It appears to act by reducing polysynaptic responses and blocking the post-tetanic potentiation. Tegretol greatly reduces or abolishes <span class='product-label-link' type='condition' conceptid='4329041' conceptname='Pain'>pain</span> induced by stimulation of the infraorbital nerve in cats and rats. It depresses thalamic potential and bulbar and polysynaptic reflexes, including the linguomandibular reflex in cats. Tegretol is chemically unrelated to other anticonvulsants or other drugs used to control the <span class='product-label-link' type='condition' conceptid='4329041' conceptname='Pain'>pain</span> of <span class='product-label-link' type='condition' conceptid='379801' conceptname='Trigeminal neuralgia'>trigeminal <span class='product-label-link' type='condition' conceptid='373852' conceptname='Neuralgia'>neuralgia</span></span>. The mechanism of action remains unknown.</p>
<p>The principal metabolite of Tegretol, <span class='product-label-link' type='medication' conceptid='740275' conceptname='Carbamazepine'>carbamazepine</span>-10,11-epoxide, has anticonvulsant activity as demonstrated in several in vivo animal models of seizures. Though clinical activity for the epoxide has been postulated, the significance of its activity with respect to the safety and efficacy of Tegretol has not been established.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span></h2>
<p class="First">In clinical studies, Tegretol suspension, conventional tablets, and XR tablets delivered equivalent amounts of drug to the systemic circulation. However, the suspension was absorbed somewhat faster, and the XR tablet slightly slower, than the conventional tablet. The bioavailability of the XR tablet was 89% compared to suspension. Following a b.i.d. dosage regimen, the suspension provides higher peak levels and lower trough levels than those obtained from the conventional tablet for the same dosage regimen. On the other hand, following a t.i.d. dosage regimen, Tegretol suspension affords steady-state plasma levels comparable to Tegretol tablets given b.i.d. when administered at the same total mg daily dose. Following a b.i.d. dosage regimen, Tegretol-XR tablets afford steady-state plasma levels comparable to conventional Tegretol tablets given q.i.d., when administered at the same total mg daily dose. Tegretol in blood is 76% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma levels of Tegretol are variable and may range from 0.5 to 25 mcg/mL, with no apparent relationship to the daily intake of the drug. Usual adult therapeutic levels are between 4 and 12 mcg/mL. In polytherapy, the concentration of Tegretol and concomitant drugs may be increased or decreased during therapy, and drug effects may be altered (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Following chronic oral administration of suspension, plasma levels peak at approximately 1.5 hours compared to 4 to 5 hours after administration of conventional Tegretol tablets, and 3 to 12 hours after administration of Tegretol-XR tablets. The CSF/serum ratio is 0.22, similar to the 24% unbound Tegretol in serum. Because Tegretol induces its own metabolism, the half-life is also variable. Autoinduction is completed after 3 to 5 weeks of a fixed dosing regimen. Initial half-life values range from 25 to 65 hours, decreasing to 12 to 17 hours on repeated doses. Tegretol is metabolized in the liver. Cytochrome P450 3A4 was identified as the major isoform responsible for the formation of <span class='product-label-link' type='medication' conceptid='740275' conceptname='Carbamazepine'>carbamazepine</span>-10,11-epoxide from Tegretol. Human microsomal epoxide hydrolase has been identified as the enzyme responsible for the formation of the 10,11-transdiol derivative from <span class='product-label-link' type='medication' conceptid='740275' conceptname='Carbamazepine'>carbamazepine</span>-10,11 epoxide. After oral administration of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-<span class='product-label-link' type='medication' conceptid='740275' conceptname='Carbamazepine'>carbamazepine</span>, 72% of the administered radioactivity was found in the urine and 28% in the feces. This urinary radioactivity was composed largely of hydroxylated and conjugated metabolites, with only 3% of unchanged Tegretol.</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetic parameters of Tegretol disposition are similar in children and in adults. However, there is a poor correlation between plasma concentrations of <span class='product-label-link' type='medication' conceptid='740275' conceptname='Carbamazepine'>carbamazepine</span> and Tegretol dose in children. <span class='product-label-link' type='medication' conceptid='740275' conceptname='Carbamazepine'>carbamazepine</span> is more rapidly metabolized to <span class='product-label-link' type='medication' conceptid='740275' conceptname='Carbamazepine'>carbamazepine</span>-10,11-epoxide (a metabolite shown to be equipotent to <span class='product-label-link' type='medication' conceptid='740275' conceptname='Carbamazepine'>carbamazepine</span> as an anticonvulsant in animal screens) in the younger age groups than in adults. In children below the age of 15, there is an inverse relationship between CBZ-E/CBZ ratio and increasing age (in one report from 0.44 in children below the age of 1 year to 0.18 in children between 10 to 15 years of age).</p>
<p>The effects of race and gender on <span class='product-label-link' type='medication' conceptid='740275' conceptname='Carbamazepine'>carbamazepine</span> pharmacokinetics have not been systematically evaluated.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Serious Dermatologic Reactions</span></h2>
<p class="First">Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and <span class='product-label-link' type='condition' conceptid='141651' conceptname='Stevens-Johnson syndrome'>Stevens-Johnson syndrome</span> (SJS), have been reported with Tegretol treatment. The risk of these events is estimated to be about 1 to 6 per 10,000 new users in countries with mainly Caucasian populations. However, the risk in some Asian countries is estimated to be about 10 times higher. Tegretol should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered.</p>

<h2>
<span class="Bold">SJS/TEN and HLA</span><span class="Bold">-B*1502 Allele</span>
</h2>
<p class="First">Retrospective case-control studies have found that in patients of Chinese ancestry there is a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN with <span class='product-label-link' type='medication' conceptid='740275' conceptname='Carbamazepine'>carbamazepine</span> treatment and the presence of an inherited variant of the HLA-B gene, HLA-B*1502. The occurrence of higher rates of these reactions in countries with higher frequencies of this allele suggests that the risk may be increased in allele-positive individuals of any ethnicity.</p>
<p>Across Asian populations, notable variation exists in the prevalence of HLA-B*1502. Greater than 15% of the population is reported positive in Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, and parts of the Philippines, compared to about 10% in Taiwan and 4% in North China. South Asians, including Indians, appear to have intermediate prevalence of HLA-B*1502, averaging 2% to 4%, but higher in some groups. HLA-B*1502 is present in less than 1% of the population in Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>HLA-B*1502 is largely absent in individuals not of Asian origin (e.g., Caucasians, African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Prior to initiating Tegretol therapy, testing for HLA</span><span class="Bold">-B*1502 should be performed in patients with ancestry in populations in which HLA</span><span class="Bold">-B*1502 may be present. </span>In deciding which patients to screen, the rates provided above for the prevalence of HLA-B*1502 may offer a rough guide, keeping in mind the limitations of these figures due to wide variability in rates even within ethnic groups, the difficulty in ascertaining ethnic ancestry, and the likelihood of mixed ancestry. Tegretol should not be used in patients positive for HLA-B*1502 unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Tested patients who are found to be negative for the allele are thought to have a low risk of SJS/TEN (see BOXED WARNING and PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests).</p>
<p>Over 90% of Tegretol treated patients who will experience SJS/TEN have this reaction within the first few months of treatment. This information may be taken into consideration in determining the need for screening of genetically at-risk patients currently on Tegretol.</p>
<p>The HLA-B*1502 allele has not been found to predict risk of less severe adverse cutaneous reactions from Tegretol such as maculopapular <span class='product-label-link' type='condition' conceptid='140214' conceptname='Eruption'>eruption</span> (MPE) or to predict Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS).</p>
<p>Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Chinese ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including <span class='product-label-link' type='medication' conceptid='740910' conceptname='Phenytoin'>phenytoin</span>. Consideration should be given to avoiding use of other drugs associated with SJS/TEN in HLA-B*1502 positive patients, when alternative therapies are otherwise equally acceptable.</p>

<p>HLA-A*3101 is expected to be carried by more than 15% of patients of Japanese, Native American, Southern Indian (for example, Tamil Nadu) and some Arabic ancestry; up to about 10% in patients of Han Chinese, Korean, European, Latin American, and other Indian ancestry; and up to about 5% in African-Americans and patients of Thai, Taiwanese, and Chinese (Hong Kong) ancestry.</p>
<p>The risks and benefits of Tegretol therapy should be weighed before considering Tegretol in patients known to be positive for HLA-A*3101.</p>
<p>Application of HLA genotyping as a screening tool has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. Many HLA-B*1502-positive and HLA-A*3101-positive patients treated with Tegretol will not develop SJS/TEN or other hypersensitivity reactions, and these reactions can still occur infrequently in HLA-B*1502-negative and HLA-A*3101-negative patients of any ethnicity. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN and other hypersensitivity reactions, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring, have not been studied.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity</span></h2>
<p class="First">Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as multiorgan hypersensitivity, has occurred with Tegretol. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and/or lymphadenopathy, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, <span class='product-label-link' type='condition' conceptid='193253' conceptname='Nephritis'>nephritis</span>, hematologic abnormalities, <span class='product-label-link' type='condition' conceptid='314383' conceptname='Myocarditis'>myocarditis</span>, or <span class='product-label-link' type='condition' conceptid='73001' conceptname='Myositis'>myositis</span> sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. This disorder is variable in its expression, and other organ systems not noted here may be involved.  It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Tegretol should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. </p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Suicidal Behavior and Ideation</span></h2>
<p class="First">Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including Tegretol, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</p>
<p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. </p>
<p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. </p>
<p>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</p>

</table>
<p>The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.</p>
<p>Anyone considering prescribing Tegretol or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. </p>
<p>Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">General</span></h2>
<p class="First">Before initiating therapy, a detailed history and physical examination should be made.</p>
<p>Tegretol should be used with caution in patients with a mixed <span class='product-label-link' type='condition' conceptid='4029498' conceptname='<span class='product-label-link' type='condition' conceptid='377091' conceptname='Seizure'>seizure</span> disorder'><span class='product-label-link' type='condition' conceptid='377091' conceptname='Seizure'>seizure</span> disorder</span> that includes atypical absence <span class='product-label-link' type='condition' conceptid='377091' conceptname='Seizure'>seizure</span>s, since in these patients Tegretol has been associated with increased frequency of generalized convulsions (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE).</p>
<p>Therapy should be prescribed only after critical benefit-to-risk appraisal in patients with a history of cardiac conduction disturbance, including second- and third-degree AV <span class='product-label-link' type='condition' conceptid='320425' conceptname='Heart block'>heart block</span>; cardiac, hepatic, or renal damage; adverse hematologic or hypersensitivity reaction to other drugs, including reactions to other anticonvulsants; or interrupted courses of therapy with Tegretol.</p>
<p>AV <span class='product-label-link' type='condition' conceptid='320425' conceptname='Heart block'>heart block</span>, including second- and third-degree block, have been reported following Tegretol treatment. This occurred generally, but not solely, in patients with underlying EKG abnormalities or risk factors for conduction disturbances.</p>
<p>Hepatic effects, ranging from slight elevations in liver enzymes to rare cases of <span class='product-label-link' type='condition' conceptid='4245975' conceptname='Hepatic failure'>hepatic failure</span> have been reported (see ADVERSE REACTIONS and PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests). In some cases, hepatic effects may progress despite discontinuation of the drug. In addition rare instances of vanishing bile duct syndrome have been reported. This syndrome consists of a cholestatic process with a variable clinical course ranging from fulminant to indolent, involving the destruction and disappearance of the intrahepatic bile ducts. Some, but not all, cases are associated with features that overlap with other immunoallergenic syndromes such as multiorgan hypersensitivity (DRESS syndrome) and serious dermatologic reactions. As an example there has been a report of vanishing bile duct syndrome associated with <span class='product-label-link' type='condition' conceptid='141651' conceptname='Stevens-Johnson syndrome'>Stevens-Johnson syndrome</span> and in another case an association with fever and eosinophilia.</p>
<p>Since a given dose of Tegretol suspension will produce higher peak levels than the same dose given as the tablet, it is recommended that patients given the suspension be started on lower doses and increased slowly to avoid unwanted side effects (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</p>
<p>Tegretol suspension contains <span class='product-label-link' type='medication' conceptid='970011' conceptname='Sorbitol'>sorbitol</span> and, therefore, should not be administered to patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance. </p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Information for Patients</span></h2>
<p class="First">Patients should be informed of the availability of a Medication Guide and they should be instructed to read the Medication Guide before taking Tegretol. </p>
<p>Patients should be made aware of the early toxic signs and symptoms of a potential hematologic problem, as well as dermatologic, hypersensitivity or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, <span class='product-label-link' type='condition' conceptid='4177703' conceptname='Ulcer'>ulcer</span>s in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, <span class='product-label-link' type='condition' conceptid='31967' conceptname='Nausea'>nausea</span>/<span class='product-label-link' type='condition' conceptid='441408' conceptname='Vomiting'>vomiting</span>, or <span class='product-label-link' type='condition' conceptid='137977' conceptname='Jaundice'>jaundice</span>. The patient should be advised that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, the patient should be advised that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised that serious skin reactions have been reported in association with Tegretol. In the event a skin reaction should occur while taking Tegretol, patients should consult with their physician immediately (see WARNINGS). </p>
<p>Patients, their caregivers, and families should be counseled that AEDs, including Tegretol, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.</p>
<p>Tegretol may interact with some drugs. Therefore, patients should be advised to report to their doctors the use of any other prescription or nonprescription medications or herbal products.</p>
<p>Caution should be exercised if alcohol is taken in combination with Tegretol therapy, due to a possible additive sedative effect.</p>
<p>Since dizziness and drowsiness may occur, patients should be cautioned about the hazards of operating machinery or automobiles or engaging in other potentially dangerous tasks.</p>
<p>Patients should be encouraged to enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. To enroll, patients can call the toll free number 1-888-233-2334 (see WARNINGS, Usage in Pregnancy subsection).</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Laboratory Tests</span></h2>
<p class="First">For genetically at-risk patients (see WARNINGS), high-resolution ‘<span class="Italics">HLA</span><span class="Italics">-B*1502 typing</span>’ is recommended. The test is positive if either one or two HLA-B*1502 alleles are detected and negative if no HLA-B*1502 alleles are detected.</p>
<p>Complete pretreatment blood counts, including platelets and possibly reticulocytes and serum iron, should be obtained as a baseline. If a patient in the course of treatment exhibits low or decreased white blood cell or platelet counts, the patient should be monitored closely. Discontinuation of the drug should be considered if any evidence of significant bone marrow depression develops.</p>
<p>Baseline and periodic evaluations of liver function, particularly in patients with a history of liver disease, must be performed during treatment with this drug since liver damage may occur (see PRECAUTIONS, General and ADVERSE REACTIONS). <span class='product-label-link' type='medication' conceptid='740275' conceptname='Carbamazepine'>Carbamazepine</span> should be discontinued, based on clinical judgment, if indicated by newly occurring or worsening clinical or laboratory evidence of liver dysfunction or hepatic damage, or in the case of active liver disease.</p>
<p>Baseline and periodic eye examinations, including slit-lamp, funduscopy, and tonometry, are recommended since many phenothiazines and related drugs have been shown to cause eye changes.</p>
<p>Baseline and periodic complete urinalysis and BUN determinations are recommended for patients treated with this agent because of observed renal dysfunction.</p>
<p>Monitoring of blood levels (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY) has increased the efficacy and safety of anticonvulsants. This monitoring may be particularly useful in cases of dramatic increase in <span class='product-label-link' type='condition' conceptid='377091' conceptname='Seizure'>seizure</span> frequency and for verification of compliance. In addition, measurement of drug serum levels may aid in determining the cause of toxicity when more than one medication is being used.</p>
<p>Thyroid function tests have been reported to show decreased values with Tegretol administered alone.</p>
<p><span class='product-label-link' type='condition' conceptid='4232311' conceptname='Hyponatremia'>Hyponatremia</span> has been reported in association with Tegretol use, either alone or in combination with other drugs.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Effect of Tegretol on Plasma Levels of Concomitant Agents</span></h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Decreased Levels of Concomitant Medications</span></p>
<p>Tegretol is a potent inducer of hepatic 3A4 and is also known to be an inducer of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9/19 and may therefore reduce plasma concentrations of co-medications mainly metabolized by CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C9/19 and 3A4, through induction of their metabolism. When used concomitantly with Tegretol, monitoring of concentrations or dosage adjustment of these agents may be necessary:</p>
<ul>
<li>When <span class='product-label-link' type='medication' conceptid='740275' conceptname='Carbamazepine'>carbamazepine</span> is added to <span class='product-label-link' type='medication' conceptid='757688' conceptname='aripiprazole'>aripiprazole</span>, the <span class='product-label-link' type='medication' conceptid='757688' conceptname='aripiprazole'>aripiprazole</span> dose should be doubled. Additional dose increases should be based on clinical evaluation. If <span class='product-label-link' type='medication' conceptid='740275' conceptname='Carbamazepine'>carbamazepine</span> is later withdrawn, the <span class='product-label-link' type='medication' conceptid='757688' conceptname='aripiprazole'>aripiprazole</span> dose should be reduced.</li>
<li>When <span class='product-label-link' type='medication' conceptid='740275' conceptname='Carbamazepine'>carbamazepine</span> is used with tacrolimus, monitoring of tacrolimus blood concentrations and appropriate dosage adjustments are recommended.</li>
<li>The use of concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers such as <span class='product-label-link' type='medication' conceptid='740275' conceptname='Carbamazepine'>carbamazepine</span> should be avoided with temsirolimus. If patients must be coadministered <span class='product-label-link' type='medication' conceptid='740275' conceptname='Carbamazepine'>carbamazepine</span> with temsirolimus, an adjustment of temsirolimus dosage should be considered.</li>
<li>The use of <span class='product-label-link' type='medication' conceptid='740275' conceptname='Carbamazepine'>carbamazepine</span> with lapatinib should generally be avoided. If <span class='product-label-link' type='medication' conceptid='740275' conceptname='Carbamazepine'>carbamazepine</span> is started in a patient already taking lapatinib, the dose of lapatinib should be gradually titrated up.  If <span class='product-label-link' type='medication' conceptid='740275' conceptname='Carbamazepine'>carbamazepine</span> is discontinued, the lapatinib dose should be reduced.</li>
<li>Concomitant use of <span class='product-label-link' type='medication' conceptid='740275' conceptname='Carbamazepine'>carbamazepine</span> with <span class='product-label-link' type='medication' conceptid='714684' conceptname='nefazodone'>nefazodone</span> results in plasma concentrations of <span class='product-label-link' type='medication' conceptid='714684' conceptname='nefazodone'>nefazodone</span> and its active metabolite insufficient to achieve a therapeutic effect. Coadministration of <span class='product-label-link' type='medication' conceptid='740275' conceptname='Carbamazepine'>carbamazepine</span> with <span class='product-label-link' type='medication' conceptid='714684' conceptname='nefazodone'>nefazodone</span> is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).</li>
<li>Monitor concentrations of <span class='product-label-link' type='medication' conceptid='745466' conceptname='Valproate'>valproate</span> when Tegretol is introduced or withdrawn in patients using valproic acid. </li>

Because the extent to which this occurs with other liquid medications is not known, Tegretol suspension should not be administered simultaneously with other liquid medications or diluents.</p>
<p>Monitoring of blood levels has increased the efficacy and safety of anticonvulsants (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests). Dosage should be adjusted to the needs of the individual patient. A low initial daily dosage with a gradual increase is advised. As soon as adequate control is achieved, the dosage may be reduced very gradually to the minimum effective level. Medication should be taken with meals.</p>
<p>Since a given dose of Tegretol suspension will produce higher peak levels than the same dose given as the tablet, it is recommended to start with low doses (children 6 to 12 years: ½ teaspoon q.i.d.) and to increase slowly to avoid unwanted side effects.</p>
<p>Conversion of patients from oral Tegretol tablets to Tegretol suspension: Patients should be converted by administering the same number of mg per day in smaller, more frequent doses (i.e., b.i.d. tablets to t.i.d. suspension).</p>
<p>Tegretol-XR is an extended-release formulation for twice-a-day administration. When converting patients from Tegretol conventional tablets to Tegretol-XR, the same total daily mg dose of Tegretol-XR should be administered. <span class="Bold">Tegretol</span><span class="Bold">-XR tablets must be swallowed whole and never crushed or chewed. </span>Tegretol-XR tablets should be inspected for chips or cracks. Damaged tablets, or tablets without a release portal, should not be consumed. Tegretol-XR tablet coating is not absorbed and is excreted in the feces; these coatings may be noticeable in the stool.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Epilepsy </span>(SEE INDICATIONS AND USAGE)</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Adults and children over 12 years of age-Initial: </span>Either 200 mg b.i.d. for tablets and XR tablets, or 1 teaspoon q.i.d. for suspension (400 mg/day). Increase at weekly intervals by adding up to 200 mg/day using a b.i.d. regimen of Tegretol-XR or a t.i.d. or q.i.d. regimen of the other formulations until the optimal response is obtained. Dosage generally should not exceed 1000 mg daily in children 12 to 15 years of age, and 1200 mg daily in patients above 15 years of age.
