<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
            Warfarin sodium and other coumarin anticoagulants act by inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, which include Factors II, VII, IX and X, and the anticoagulant proteins C and S. Half-lives of these clotting factors are as follows: Factor II60 hours, VII4 to 6 hours, IX - 24 hours, and X48 to 72 hours. The half-lives of proteins C and S are approximately 8 hours and 30 hours, respectively. The resultant in vivo effect is a sequential <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> of Factor VII, Protein C, Factor IX, Protein S, and Factor X and II activities. Vitamin K is an essential cofactor for the post ribosomal synthesis of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. The vitamin promotes the biosynthesis of g-carboxyglutamic acid residues in the proteins which are essential for biological activity.<br><br><span class="Bold">
              Mechanism of Action<br></span>Warfarin is thought to interfere with clotting factor synthesis by inhibition of the C1 subunit of the vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1) enzyme complex, thereby reducing the regeneration of vitamin K1 epoxide. The degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> is dependent upon the dosage administered and, in part, by the patient's VKORC1 genotype. Therapeutic doses of warfarin decrease the total amount of the active form of each vitamin K-dependent clotting factor made by the liver by approximately 30% to 50%. An anticoagulation effect generally occurs within 24 hours after drug administration. However, peak anticoagulant effect may be delayed 72 to 96 hours. The duration of action of a single dose of racemic warfarin is 2 to 5 days. The effects of warfarin sodium may become more pronounced as effects of daily maintenance doses overlap. Anticoagulants have no direct effect on an established thrombus, nor do they reverse ischemic tissue damage. However, once a thrombus has occurred, the goal of anticoagulant treatment is to prevent further extension of the formed clot and prevent secondary thromboembolic complications which may result in serious and possibly fatal sequelae.<br><br><span class="Bold">
              Pharmacokinetics<br></span>Warfarin sodium is a racemic mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers. The S-enantiomer exhibits 2 to 5 times more anticoagulant activity than the R-enantiomer in humans, but generally has a more rapid clearance.<br>Absorption<br>Warfarin is essentially completely absorbed after oral administration with peak concentration generally attained within the first 4 hours.<br>Distribution<br>There are no differences in the apparent volumes of distribution after intravenous and oral administration of single doses of warfarin solution. Warfarin distributes into a relatively small apparent volume of distribution of about 0.14 liter/kg. A distribution phase lasting 6 to 12 hours is distinguishable after rapid intravenous or oral administration of an aqueous solution. Using a one compartment model, and assuming complete bioavailability, estimates of the volumes of distribution of R- and S-warfarin are similar to each other and to that of the racemate. Concentrations in fetal plasma approach the maternal values, but warfarin has not been found in human milk (see<span class="Underline">WARNINGS</span>:<span class="Underline">Lactation</span>). Approximately 99% of the drug is bound to plasma proteins.<br>Metabolism<br>The elimination of warfarin is almost entirely by metabolism. Warfarin sodium is stereoselectively metabolized by hepatic microsomal enzymes (cytochrome P-450) to inactive hydroxylated metabolites (predominant route) and by reductases to reduced metabolites (warfarin alcohols). The warfarin alcohols have minimal anticoagulant activity. The metabolites are principally excreted into the urine; and to a lesser extent into the bile. The metabolites of warfarin that have been identified include dehydrowarfarin, two diastereoisomer alcohols, 4'-, 6-, 7-, 8- and 10-hydroxywarfarin. The cytochrome P-450 isozymes involved in the metabolism of warfarin include 2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2C18, 1A2, and 3A4. 2C9 is likely to be the principal form of human liver P-450 which modulates the in vivo anticoagulant activity of warfarin.<br>The S-enantiomer of warfarin is mainly metabolized to 7-hydroxywarfarin by CYP2C9, a polymorphic enzyme. The variant alleles CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 result in decreased in vitro CYP2C9 enzymatic 7-hydroxylation of S-warfarin. The frequencies of these alleles in Caucasians are approximately 11% and 7% for CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3, respectively.1 Patients with one or more of these variant CYP2C9 alleles have decreased S-warfarin clearance (<span class="Underline">Table 1</span>).2<br><br>Table 1: Relationship Between S-Warfarin Clearance andCYP2C9 Genotype in Caucasian Patients<br>*SD = Standard deviation.Pairwise comparisons indicated significant differences among all 3 genotypes.CYP2C9NS-Warfarin Clearance/Lean Body Weight (mL/min/kg) Mean (SD)**1/*11180.065(1.025)*1/*2 or *1/*3590.041 (0.021)*1/*2, *2/*3, or *3/*3110.020 (0.011)Total188Other CYP2C9 alleles associated with reduced enzymatic activity occur at lower frequencies, including *5, *6 and *11 alleles in populations of African ancestry and *5, *9 and *11 alleles in Caucasians.<br>Excretion<br>The terminal half-life of warfarin after a single dose is approximately one week; however, the effective half-life ranges from 20 to 60 hours, with a mean of about 40 hours. The clearance of R-warfarin is generally half that of S-warfarin, thus as the volumes of distribution are similar, the half-life of R-warfarin is longer than that of S-warfarin. The half-life of R-warfarin ranges from 37 to 89 hours, while that of S-warfarin ranges from 21 to 43 hours. Studies with radiolabeled drug have demonstrated that up to 92% of the orally administered dose is recovered in urine. Very little warfarin is excreted unchanged in urine. Urinary excretion is in the form of metabolites.<br><br><span class="Bold">
              Pharmacogenomics<br></span>A meta-analysis of nine qualified studies including 2,775 patients (99% Caucasian) was performed to examine the clinical outcomes associated with CYP2C9 gene variants in warfarin-treated patients.3 In this meta-analysis, three studies assessed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> risks and eight studies assessed daily dose requirements. The analysis suggested an increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> risk for patients carrying either the CYP2C9*2 or CYP2C9*3 alleles. Patients carrying at least one copy of the CYP2C9*2 allele required a mean daily warfarin dose that was 17% less than the mean daily dose for patients homozygous for the CYP2C9*1 allele. For patients carrying at least one copy of the CYP2C9*3 allele, the mean daily warfarin dose was 37% less than the mean daily dose for patients homozygous for the CYP2C9*1 allele.<br>In an observational study, the risk of achieving INR &gt; 3 during the first 3 weeks of warfarin therapy was determined in 219 Swedish patients retrospectively grouped by CYP2C9 genotype. The relative risk of over anticoagulation as measured by INR &gt; 3 during the first 2 weeks of therapy was approximately doubled for those patients classified as *2 or *3 compared to patients who were homozygous for the *1 allele.4<br>Warfarin reduces the regeneration of vitamin K from vitamin K epoxide in the vitamin K cycle, through inhibition of vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR), a multiprotein enzyme complex. Certain single nucleotide polymorphisms in the VKORC1 gene (especially the -1639G &gt; A allele) have been associated with lower dose requirements for warfarin. In 201 Caucasian patients treated with stable warfarin doses, genetic variations in the VKORC1 gene were associated with lower warfarin doses. In this study, about 30% of the variance in warfarin dose could be attributed to variations in the VKORC1 gene alone; about 40% of the variance in warfarin dose could be attributed to variations in VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genes combined.5 About 55% of the variability in warfarin dose could be explained by the combination of VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genotypes, age, height, body weight, interacting drugs, and indication for warfarin therapy in Caucasian patients.5 Similar observations have been reported in Asian patients.6,7<br><span class="Bold">Elderly</span><br>Patients 60 years or older appear to exhibit greater than expected PT/INR response to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin. The cause of the increased sensitivity to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin in this age group is unknown. This increased anticoagulant effect from warfarin may be due to a combination of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors. Racemic warfarin clearance may be unchanged or reduced with increasing age. Limited information suggests there is no difference in the clearance of S-warfarin in the elderly vs. young subjects. However, there may be a slight decrease in the clearance of R-warfarin in the elderly as compared to the young. Therefore, as patient age increases, a lower dose of warfarin is usually required to produce a therapeutic level of anticoagulation.<br><span class="Bold">Asians</span><br>Asian patients may require lower initiation and maintenance doses of warfarin. One non-controlled study conducted in 151 Chinese outpatients reported a mean daily warfarin requirement of 3.31.4 mg to achieve an INR of 2 to 2.5. These patients were stabilized on warfarin for various indications. Patient age was the most important determinant of warfarin requirement in Chinese patients with a progressively lower warfarin requirement with increasing age.<br><span class="Bold">Renal Dysfunction</span><br>Renal clearance is considered to be a minor determinant of anticoagulant response to warfarin. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span>.<br><span class="Bold">Hepatic Dysfunction</span><br>Hepatic dysfunction can potentiate the response to warfarin through impaired synthesis of clotting factors and decreased metabolism of warfarin.<br>The administration of warfarin sodium via the intravenous (IV) route should provide the patient with the same concentration of an equal oral dose, but maximum plasma concentration will be reached earlier. However, the full anticoagulant effect of a dose of warfarin may not be achieved until 72 to 96 hours after dosing, indicating that the administration of IV warfarin sodium should not provide any increased biological effect or earlier onset of action.<br><span class="Bold">

In severe cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280654" conceptname="Necrosis">necrosis</span>, treatment through debridement or amputation of the affected tissue, limb, breast or penis has been reported. Careful diagnosis is required to determine whether <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280654" conceptname="Necrosis">necrosis</span> is caused by an underlying disease. Warfarin therapy should be discontinued when warfarin is suspected to be the cause of developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280654" conceptname="Necrosis">necrosis</span> and heparin therapy may be considered for anticoagulation. Although various treatments have been attempted, no treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280654" conceptname="Necrosis">necrosis</span> has been considered uniformly effective. See below for information on predisposing conditions.

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<span class="Bold">Periodic determination of PT/INR is essential</span>(see<span class="Underline">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>:<span class="Underline">Laboratory Control</span>). Numerous factors, alone or in combination including changes in diet, medications, botanicals, and genetic variations in the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 enzymes (see<span class="Underline">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:Pharmacogenomics</span>) may influence the response of the patient to warfarin.<br><span class="Bold">
              Drug-Drug and Drug-Disease Interactions<br>It is generally good practice to monitor the patient<br>Drugs may interact with warfarin sodium through pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic mechanisms. Pharmacodynamic mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are synergism (impaired hemostasis, reduced clotting factor synthesis), competitive antagonism (vitamin K), and altered physiologic control loop for vitamin K metabolism (hereditary resistance). Pharmacokinetic mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are mainly enzyme induction, enzyme inhibition, and reduced plasma protein binding. It is important to note that some drugs may interact by more than one mechanism. The following factors, alone or in combination, may be responsible for INCREASED PT/INR response:

<h1>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</h1>
            The objective of anticoagulant therapy is to decrease the clotting ability of the blood so that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4130722" conceptname="Thrombosis">thrombosis</span> is prevented, while avoiding spontaneous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>. Effective therapeutic levels with minimal complications are in part dependent upon cooperative and well-instructed patients who communicate effectively with their physician. Patients should be advised: Strict adherence to prescribed dosage schedule is necessary. Do not take or discontinue any other medication, including salicylates (e.g., aspirin and topical analgesics), other over-the-counter medications, and botanical (herbal) products except on advice of the physician. Avoid alcohol consumption. Do not take warfarin sodium during pregnancy and do not become pregnant while taking it (see<span class="Underline">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>). Avoid any activity or sport that may result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433633" conceptname="Late effect of superficial injury">traumatic injury</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">Prothrombin</span> time tests and regular visits to physician or clinic are needed to monitor therapy. Carry identification stating that warfarin sodium is being taken. If the prescribed dose of warfarin sodium is forgotten, notify the physician immediately. Take the dose as soon as possible on the same day but do not take a double dose of warfarin sodium the next day to make up for missed doses. The amount of vitamin K in food may affect therapy with warfarin sodium. Eat a normal, balanced diet maintaining a consistent amount of vitamin K. Avoid drastic changes in dietary habits, such as eating large amounts of green leafy vegetables. You should also avoid intake of cranberry juice or any other cranberry products. Notify your healthcare provider if any of these products are part of your normal diet.

For patients with a St. Jude Medical (St. Paul, MN) bileaflet valve in the aortic position, a target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0) is recommended. For patients with tilting disk valves and bileaflet mechanical valves in the mitral position, the 7th ACCP recommends a target INR of 3.0 (range, 2.5 to 3.5). For patients with caged ball or caged disk valves, a target INR of 3.0 (range, 2.5 to 3.5) in combination with aspirin, 75 to 100 mg/day is recommended. For patients with bioprosthetic valves, warfarin therapy with a target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0) is recommended for valves in the mitral position and is suggested for valves in the aortic position for the first 3 months after valve insertion.15<br><span class="Bold">Recurrent Systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185607" conceptname="Embolism">Embolism</span> and Other Indications</span><br>Oral anticoagulation therapy has not been evaluated by properly designed clinical trials in patients with valvular disease associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">atrial fibrillation</span>, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315273" conceptname="Mitral valve stenosis">mitral stenosis</span>, and patients with recurrent systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185607" conceptname="Embolism">embolism</span> of unknown etiology.

              </dd>
</dl>Select the starting dose based on the expected maintenance dose, taking into account the above factors. Routine use of loading doses is not recommended as this may increase hemorrhagic and other complications and does not offer more rapid protection against clot formation. If the patient's CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes are not known, the initial dose of warfarin sodium tablets is usually 2 mg to 5 mg per day. Modify this dose based on consideration of patient-specific clinical factors. Consider lower initiation doses for<br>elderly and/or debilitated patients (see<span class="Underline">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>and<span class="Underline">PRECAUTIONS</span>).<br>The patient's CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotype information, when available, can assist in selection of the starting dose. Table 5 describes the range of stable maintenance doses observed in multiple patients having different combinations of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 gene variants. Consider these ranges in choosing the initial dose. In all patients, subsequent dosage adjustments must be made based on the results of PT/INR determinations.17, 18<br>Table 5: Range of Expected Therapeutic Warfarin Doses Based on CYP2C9 and VKORC1 Genotypes*<br>*Ranges are derived from multiple published clinical studies. Other clinical factors (e.g., age, race, body weight, sex, concomitant medications and comorbidities) are generally accounted for along with genotype in the ranges expressed in the Table. VKORC11639 G#A (rs9923231) variant is used in this table. Other coinherited VKORC1 variants may also be important determinants of warfarin dose. Patients with CYP2C9 * 1/*3, *2/*2, *2/*3 and *3/*3 may require more prolonged time (&gt; 2 to 4 weeks) to achieve maximum INR effect for a given dosage regimen.VKORC1CYP2C9*1/*1*1/*2*1/*3*2/*2*2/*3*3/*3GG5 mg to 7 mg5 mg to 7 mg3 mg to 4 mg3 mg to 4 mg3 mg to 4 mg0.5 mg to 2 mgAG5 mg to 7 mg3 mg to 4 mg3 mg to 4 mg3 mg to 4 mg0.5 mg to 2 mg0.5 mg to 2 mgAA3 mg to 4 mg3 mg to 4 mg0.5 mg to 2 mg0.5 mg to 2 mg0.5 mg to 2 mg0.5 mg to 2 mg<span class="Bold">Maintenance</span><br>Most patients are satisfactorily maintained at a dose of 2 mg to 10 mg daily. Flexibility of dosage is provided by breaking scored tablets in half. The individual dose and interval should be gauged by the patient's <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> response. Acquired or inherited warfarin resistance is rare, but should be suspected if large daily doses of warfarin sodium tablets are required to maintain a patient's PT/INR within a normal therapeutic range. Lower maintenance doses are recommended for elderly and/or debilitated patients and patients with a potential to exhibit greater than expected PT/INR response to warfarin sodium tablets (see<span class="Underline">PRECAUTIONS</span>).<br><span class="Bold">Duration of Therapy</span><br>The duration of therapy in each patient should be individualized.

If the patient forgets to take the prescribed dose of warfarin sodium tablets at the scheduled time, the dose should be taken as soon as possible on the same day. The patient should not take the missed dose by doubling the daily dose to make up for missed doses, but should refer back to his or her physician.<br><span class="Bold">Intravenous Route of Administration</span><br>Warfarin sodium for Injection provides an alternate administration route for patients who cannot receive oral drugs. The IV dosages would be the same as those that would be used orally if the patient could take the drug by the oral route. Warfarin sodium for Injection should be administered as a slow bolus injection over 1 to 2 minutes into a peripheral vein. It is not recommended for intramuscular administration. The vial should be reconstituted with 2.7 mL of sterile water for injection and inspected for particulate matter and discoloration immediately prior to use. Do not use if either particulate matter and/or discoloration is noted. After reconstitution, warfarin sodium for injection is chemically and physically stable for 4 hours at room temperature. It does not contain any antimicrobial preservative and, thus, care must be taken to assure the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4035976" conceptname="Sterility">sterility</span> of the prepared solution. The vial is not recommended for multiple use and unused solution should be discarded.<br><br><span class="Bold">
              Laboratory Control<br></span>The PT reflects the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> of vitamin K-dependent Factors VII, X and II. A system of standardizing the PT in oral anticoagulant control was introduced by the World Health Organization in 1983. It is based upon the determination of an International Normalized Ratio (INR) which provides a common basis for communication of PT results and interpretations of therapeutic ranges.24The PT should be determined daily after the administration of the initial dose until PT/INR results stabilize in the therapeutic range. Intervals between subsequent PT/INR determinations should be based upon the physician's judgment of the patient's reliability and response to warfarin sodium in order to maintain the individual within the therapeutic range. Acceptable intervals for PT/INR determinations are normally within the range of 1 to 4 weeks after a stable dosage has been determined. To ensure adequate control, it is recommended that additional PT tests be done when other warfarin products are interchanged with warfarin sodium tablets, as well as whenever other medications are initiated, discontinued, or taken irregularly (see<span class="Underline">PRECAUTIONS</span>). Safety and efficacy of warfarin therapy can be improved by increasing the quality of laboratory control. Reports suggest that in usual care monitoring, patients are in therapeutic range only 33% to 64% of the time. Time in therapeutic range is significantly greater (56% to 93%) in patients managed by anticoagulation clinics, among self-testing and self-monitoring patients, and in patients managed with the help of computer programs.25 Self-testing patients had fewer <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> events than patients in usual care.25<br><span class="Bold">Treatment during Dentistry and Surgery</span><br>The management of patients who undergo dental and surgical procedures requires close liaison between attending physicians, surgeons and dentists.15,19 PT/INR determination is recommended just prior to any dental or surgical procedure. In patients undergoing minimal invasive procedures who must be anticoagulated prior to, during, or immediately following these procedures, adjusting the dosage of warfarin sodium tablets to maintain the PT/INR at the low end of the therapeutic range may safely allow for continued anticoagulation. The operative site should be sufficiently limited and accessible to permit the effective use of local procedures for hemostasis. Under these conditions, dental and minor surgical procedures may be performed without undue risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">hemorrhage</span>. Some dental or surgical procedures may necessitate the interruption of warfarin sodium tablet therapy. When discontinuing warfarin sodium tablets even for a short period of time, the benefits and risks should be strongly considered.<br><span class="Bold">Conversion from Heparin Therapy</span><br>Since the anticoagulant effect of warfarin sodium tablets is delayed, heparin is preferred initially for rapid anticoagulation. Conversion to warfarin sodium tablets may begin concomitantly with heparin therapy or may be delayed 3 to 6 days. To ensure continuous anticoagulation, it is advisable to continue full dose heparin therapy and that warfarin sodium tablet therapy be overlapped with heparin for 4 to 5 days, until warfarin sodium tablets have produced the desired therapeutic response as determined by PT/INR. When warfarin sodium tablets have produced the desired PT/INR or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> activity, heparin may be discontinued. Warfarin sodium tablets may increase the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44809202" conceptname="Activated partial thromboplastin time">activated partial thromboplastin time</span> (aPTT) test, even in the absence of heparin.
