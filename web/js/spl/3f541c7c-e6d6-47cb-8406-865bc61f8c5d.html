<p class="First">This topical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relief patch was recently reformulated by pharmacists who specialize in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> management. Natural ingredients have been added to these patches for a better, more refreshing scent. Scientific studies have shown that both ingredients used in this product significantly reduce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span>.<span class="Sup">i</span>  A combination of ingredients with analgesics and anesthetic properties are used in a unique way to maximize its <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relieving effects and to aid in addition to other therapies. This offers long lasting relief for a variety of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> conditions. Limencin Patch is manufactured in accordance with FDA regulations by an FDA approved manufacturer.</p>

<h2>Mechanism of Action:</h2>
<p class="First">Menthol has some local anesthetic and counterirritant qualities and also acts as a weak kappa opioid receptor agonist making it an analgesic as well. Its ability to chemically trigger the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">cold</span>-sensitive TRPM8 receptors in the skin is responsible for its cooling sensation when applied to the skin. Lastly, it enhances the efficacy of other topical applications by increasing penetration via vasodilation. </p>
<p>Lidocaine is a common local anesthetic that relieves <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302654" conceptname="Itching">itching</span>, burning, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>. Topically, it blocks both initiation and conduction of nerve impulses by decreasing ionic flux through the neuronal membrane. Since it penetrates the skin, it creates an anesthetic effect by not just preventing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> signals from propagating to the brain, but by stopping them before they begin.</p>

<h2>Benefits:</h2>
<p class="First">The use of this topical medication, Limencin Patch, over other oral options for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relief can benefit patients in many different ways. Conventional therapies using opioids (hydrocodone, hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone) can cause systemic adverse effects such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">constipation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">lightheadedness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, sedation, and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>. NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen) can increase cardiovascular risk, decrease platelet aggregation, and cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">gastrointestinal bleeding</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcers</span>. Other classes of medications such as antidepressants (nortriptyline, duloxetine) or anticonvulsants (gabapentin) also come with its costs and side effects. Limencin Patch acts only locally since it penetrates the skin and not into the bloodstream. In addition, patients can have one or multiple disease states including renal or hepatic dysfunction which can prevent them from taking ibuprofen (Advil) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) respectively. More importantly, this patch gives physicians an option to provide effective <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relief treatment while avoiding the addictive properties of conventional oral medications. It can also be supplemented with other topical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> lotions. In addition, it avoids messy application and reduces risk of getting ingredients in eyes or other mucous membranes.</p>

<h2>Product Information and Data:</h2>
<p class="First">Pharmacists that have been in the field of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> management for many years used research from all parts of the world to carefully formulate this patch in order to maximize its <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relieving properties.<span class="Sup">iii</span>   Skin penetrating mixtures have also been added to enhance rapid absorption of the active ingredients through the skin to allow deeper penetration into the muscles, joints, and nerves. Lidocaine patches for therapy of neuropathic and non-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373852" conceptname="Neuralgia">neuropathic pain</span> was concluded â€œto be an effective and safe option for add-on therapyâ€? (Nervenarzt, 2010) in a clinical case series using 87 patients.<span class="Sup">iv</span>  Another study in 2010 concluded that a single 8 hour application of a combination patch of menthol provided signigicant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relief associated with mild to moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> when compared to a placebo patch.<span class="Sup">v</span>  The use of these pharmaceutical and natural components provides more <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relief and makes the patch a new way to address <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>. These ingredients comply with The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436096" conceptname="Chronic pain">Chronic Pain</span> Medical Treatment Guidelines and the ACOEM guidelines for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> management.<span class="Sup">vi</span>   Page 111 of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436096" conceptname="Chronic pain">Chronic Pain</span> Medical Treatment Guidelines concludes that topical analgesics are â€œprimarily recommended for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373852" conceptname="Neuralgia">neuropathic pain</span> when trials of antidepressants and anticonvulsants have failed (Namaka, 2004).â€? In addition to this, â€œthese agents are applied locally to painful areas with advantages that include lack of systemic side effects, absence of drug interactions, and no need to titrate (Colombo, 2006).â€? This product is â€œrecognized as safe and effectiveâ€? because it meets all conditions of the CFR.<span class="Sup">vii</span>  Limencin Patch complies with The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436096" conceptname="Chronic pain">Chronic Pain</span> Medical Treatment Guidelines and the ACOEM guidelines for a variety of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pains</span> mentioned above.<span class="Sup">viii</span></p>
