<h1><span class="Emphasis">WARNINGS: CARDIOVASCULAR RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SMOKING</span></h1>
<p class="First">Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptive use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, combination oral contraceptives, including ORTHO-CEPT<span class="Sup">®</span>, should not be used by women who are over 35 years of age and smoke.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="43681-6">
<a name="section-3.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">Combined oral contraceptives act by suppression of gonadotropins. Although the primary mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other alterations include changes in the cervical mucus, which increase the difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus, and changes in the endometrium which reduce the likelihood of implantation.</p>
<p>Receptor binding studies, as well as studies in animals, have shown that 3-keto-desogestrel, the biologically active metabolite of desogestrel, combines high progestational activity with minimal intrinsic androgenicity.<span class="Sup">91,92</span> The relevance of this latter finding in humans is unknown.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="43682-4">
<a name="section-3.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Desogestrel is rapidly and almost completely absorbed and converted into 3-keto-desogestrel, its biologically active metabolite. Following oral administration, the relative bioavailability of desogestrel, as measured by serum levels of 3-keto-desogestrel, is approximately 84%.</p>
<p>In the third cycle of use after a single dose of ORTHO-CEPT<span class="Sup">®</span>, maximum concentrations of 3-keto-desogestrel of 2,805 ± 1,203 pg/mL (mean ± SD) are reached at 1.4 ± 0.8 hours. The area under the curve (AUC<span class="Sub">0–∞</span>) is 33,858 ± 11,043 pg/mL∙hr after a single dose. At steady state, attained from at least day 19 onwards, maximum concentrations of 5,840 ± 1,667 pg/mL are reached at 1.4 ± 0.9 hours. The minimum plasma levels of 3-keto-desogestrel at steady state are 1,400 ± 560 pg/mL. The AUC<span class="Sub">0–24</span> at steady state is 52,299 ± 17,878 pg/mL∙hr. The mean AUC<span class="Sub">0–∞</span> for 3-keto-desogestrel at single dose is significantly lower than the mean AUC<span class="Sub">0–24</span> at steady state. This indicates that the kinetics of 3-keto-desogestrel are non-linear due to an increase in binding of 3-keto-desogestrel to sex hormone-binding globulin in the cycle, attributed to increased sex hormone-binding globulin levels which are induced by the daily administration of ethinyl estradiol. Sex hormone-binding globulin levels increased significantly in the third treatment cycle from day 1 (150 ± 64 nmol/L) to day 21 (230 ± 59 nmol/L).</p>
<p>The elimination half-life for 3-keto-desogestrel is approximately 38 ± 20 hours at steady state. In addition to 3-keto-desogestrel, other phase I metabolites are 3α-OH-desogestrel, 3β-OH-desogestrel, and 3α-OH-5α-H-desogestrel. These other metabolites are not known to have any pharmacologic effects, and are further converted in part by conjugation (phase II metabolism) into polar metabolites, mainly sulfates and glucuronides.</p>
<p>Ethinyl estradiol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. In the third cycle of use after a single dose of ORTHO-CEPT<span class="Sup">®</span>, the relative bioavailability is approximately 83%.</p>
<p>In the third cycle of use after a single dose of ORTHO-CEPT<span class="Sup">®</span>, maximum concentrations of ethinyl estradiol of 95 ± 34 pg/mL are reached at 1.5 ± 0.8 hours. The AUC<span class="Sub">0–∞</span> is 1,471 ± 268 pg/mL∙hr after a single dose. At steady state, attained from at least day 19 onwards, maximum ethinyl estradiol concentrations of 141 ± 48 pg/mL are reached at about 1.4 ± 0.7 hours. The minimum serum levels of ethinyl estradiol at steady state are 24 ± 8.3 pg/mL. The AUC<span class="Sub">0–24</span> at steady state is 1,117 ± 302 pg/mL∙hr. The mean AUC<span class="Sub">0–∞</span> for ethinyl estradiol following a single dose during treatment cycle 3 does not significantly differ from the mean AUC<span class="Sub">0–24</span> at steady state. This finding indicates linear kinetics for ethinyl estradiol.</p>
<p>The elimination half-life is 26 ± 6.8 hours at steady state. Ethinyl estradiol is subject to a significant degree of presystemic conjugation (phase II metabolism). Ethinyl estradiol escaping gut wall conjugation undergoes phase I metabolism and hepatic conjugation (phase II metabolism). Major phase I metabolites are 2-OH-ethinyl estradiol and 2-methoxy-ethinyl estradiol. Sulfate and glucuronide conjugates of both ethinyl estradiol and phase I metabolites, which are excreted in bile, can undergo enterohepatic circulation.</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">ORTHO-CEPT<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets are indicated for the prevention of pregnancy in women who elect to use oral contraceptives as a method of contraception.</p>
<p>Oral contraceptives are highly effective. Table 1 lists the typical accidental pregnancy rates for users of combined oral contraceptives and other methods of contraception. The efficacy of these contraceptive methods, except sterilization, the IUD, and the Norplant System depends upon the reliability with which they are used. Correct and consistent use of these methods can result in lower failure rates.</p>
<p>In a clinical trial with ORTHO-CEPT<span class="Sup">®</span>, 1,195 subjects completed 11,656 cycles and a total of 10 pregnancies were reported. This represents an overall user-efficacy (typical user-efficacy) pregnancy rate of 1.12 per 100 women-years. This rate includes patients who did not take the drug correctly.</p>

<dd>The treatment schedule is one dose within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse, and a second dose 12 hours after the first dose. The FDA has declared the following brands of oral contraceptives to be safe and effective for emergency contraception: Ovral<span class="Sup">®</span> (1 dose is 2 white pills), Alesse<span class="Sup">®</span> (1 dose is 5 pink pills), Nordette<span class="Sup">®</span> or Levlen<span class="Sup">®</span> (1 dose is 4 yellow pills).</dd>

<p>Practitioners prescribing oral contraceptives should be familiar with the following information relating to these risks.</p>
<p>The information contained in this package insert is principally based on studies carried out in patients who used oral contraceptives with formulations of higher doses of estrogens and progestogens than those in common use today. The effect of long-term use of the oral contraceptives with formulations of lower doses of both estrogens and progestogens remains to be determined.</p>
<p>Throughout this labeling, epidemiological studies reported are of two types: retrospective or case control studies and prospective or cohort studies. Case control studies provide a measure of the relative risk of a disease, namely, <span class="Italics">a ratio</span> of the incidence of a disease among oral contraceptive users to that among nonusers. The relative risk does not provide information on the actual clinical occurrence of a disease. Cohort studies provide a measure of attributable risk, which is the <span class="Italics">difference</span> in the incidence of disease between oral contraceptive users and nonusers. The attributable risk does provide information about the actual occurrence of a disease in the population (Adapted from refs. 2 and 3 with the author's permission). For further information, the reader is referred to a text on epidemiological methods.</p>

<h3>d. Dose-Related Risk of Vascular Disease from Oral Contraceptives</h3>
<p class="First">A positive association has been observed between the amount of estrogen and progestogen in oral contraceptives and the risk of vascular disease.<span class="Sup">31–33</span> A decline in serum high density lipoproteins (HDL) has been reported with many progestational agents.<span class="Sup">14–16</span> A decline in serum high density lipoproteins has been associated with an increased incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4124683" conceptname="Silent myocardial ischemia">ischemic heart disease</span>. Because estrogens increase HDL <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>, the net effect of an oral contraceptive depends on a balance achieved between doses of estrogen and progestogen and the nature and absolute amount of progestogens used in the contraceptives. The amount of both hormones should be considered in the choice of an oral contraceptive.</p>
<p>Minimizing exposure to estrogen and progestogen is in keeping with good principles of therapeutics. For any particular estrogen/progestogen combination, the dosage regimen prescribed should be one which contains the least amount of estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate and the needs of the individual patient. New acceptors of oral contraceptive agents should be started on preparations containing the lowest estrogen content which is judged appropriate for the individual patient.</p>

<h2>2. Estimates of Mortality from Contraceptive Use</h2>
<p class="First">One study gathered data from a variety of sources which have estimated the mortality rate associated with different methods of contraception at different ages (Table 2). These estimates include the combined risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> associated with contraceptive methods plus the risk attributable to pregnancy in the event of method failure. Each method of contraception has its specific benefits and risks. The study concluded that with the exception of oral contraceptive users 35 and older who smoke and 40 and older who do not smoke, mortality associated with all methods of birth control is low and below that associated with childbirth.</p>
<p>The observation of an increase in risk of mortality with age for oral contraceptive users is based on data gathered in the 1970's.<span class="Sup">35</span> Current clinical recommendation involves the use of lower estrogen dose formulations and a careful consideration of risk factors. In 1989, the Fertility and Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee was asked to review the use of oral contraceptives in women 40 years of age and over. The Committee concluded that although cardiovascular disease risk may be increased with oral contraceptive use after age 40 in healthy non-smoking women (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are also greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women and with the alternative surgical and medical procedures which may be necessary if such women do not have access to effective and acceptable means of contraception. The Committee recommended that the benefits of low-dose oral contraceptive use by healthy non-smoking women over 40 may outweigh the possible risks.</p>
<p>Of course, older women, as all women who take oral contraceptives, should take an oral contraceptive which contains the least amount of estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate and individual patient needs.</p>

<h2>3. Carcinoma of the Reproductive Organs and Breasts</h2>
<p class="First">Numerous epidemiological studies have been performed on the incidence of breast, endometrial, ovarian, and cervical cancer in women using oral contraceptives.</p>
<p>The risk of having breast cancer diagnosed may be slightly increased among current and recent users of combined oral contraceptives (COC). However, this excess risk appears to decrease over time after COC discontinuation  and by 10 years after cessation the increased risk disappears. Some studies report an increased risk with duration of use while other studies do not and no consistent relationships have been found with dose or type of steroid. Some studies have found a small increase in risk for women who first use COCs before age 20. Most studies show a similar pattern of risk with COC use regardless of a woman's reproductive history or her family breast cancer history.</p>
<p>Breast cancers diagnosed in current or previous oral contraceptive users tend to be less clinically advanced than in nonusers.</p>
<p>Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use oral contraceptives because breast cancer is usually a hormonally-sensitive tumor.</p>
<p>Some studies suggest that oral contraceptive use has been associated with an increase in the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198572" conceptname="Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia">cervical intraepithelial neoplasia</span> in some populations of women.<span class="Sup">45–48</span> However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.</p>

<h2>2. Physical Examination and Follow-Up</h2>
<p class="First">It is good medical practice for all women to have annual history and physical examinations, including women using oral contraceptives. The physical examination, however, may be deferred until after initiation of oral contraceptives if requested by the woman and judged appropriate by the clinician. The physical examination should include special reference to blood pressure, breasts, abdomen and pelvic organs, including cervical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="45771295" conceptname="Cytology">cytology</span>, and relevant laboratory tests. In case of undiagnosed, persistent or recurrent abnormal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129155" conceptname="Vaginal bleeding">vaginal bleeding</span>, appropriate measures should be conducted to rule out malignancy.

<h3>Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Hormonal Contraceptives</h3>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-7.8.1.1"></a><p></p>
<h4>Substances decreasing the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminishing the efficacy of COCs</h4>
<p class="First">Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of CHCs or increase breakthrough <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant, and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between hormonal contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with CHCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-7.8.1.2"></a><p></p>
<h4>Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs</h4>
<p class="First">Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20–25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">

<h4>Human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433740" conceptname="Immunodeficiency disorder">immunodeficiency</span> virus (HIV)/ <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">Hepatitis</span> C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors</h4>
<p class="First">Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and/or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir]) /HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir]) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]).</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-7.8.1.3.1"></a><p></p>
<h5>Colesevelam</h5>
<p class="First">Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, given together with a combination oral hormonal contraceptive, has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of EE. A drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-7.8.2"></a><p></p>
<h3>Effects of Combined Hormonal Contraceptives on Other Drugs</h3>
<p class="First">COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid, temazepam and lamotrigine. Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary.</p>
<p>Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs.</p>

<h2>9. Interactions with Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">Certain endocrine and liver function tests and blood components may be affected by oral contraceptives:</p>
<ol class="LittleAlpha">
<li>Increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> and factors VII, VIII, IX, and X; decreased antithrombin 3; increased norepinephrine-induced platelet aggregability.</li>
<li>Increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4188578" conceptname="Thyroxine binding globulin">thyroid binding globulin</span> (TBG) leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone, as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 by column or by radioimmunoassay. Free T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG; free T4 concentration is unaltered.</li>
<li>Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum.</li>
<li><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4206320" conceptname="Sex steroid binding globulin">Sex hormone binding globulins</span> are increased and result in elevated levels of total circulating sex steroids however, free or biologically active levels either decrease or remain unchanged.</li>
<li>Triglycerides may be increased and levels of various other lipids and lipoproteins may be affected.</li>
<li>Glucose tolerance may be decreased.</li>
<li>Serum folate levels may be depressed by oral contraceptive therapy. This may be of clinical significance if a woman becomes pregnant shortly after discontinuing oral contraceptives.</li>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, ORTHO-CEPT<span class="Sup">®</span> must be taken exactly as directed and at intervals not exceeding 24 hours. ORTHO-CEPT<span class="Sup">®</span> is available in a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443720" conceptname="Blister">blister</span> card with a tablet dispenser which is preset for a Sunday Start. Day 1 Start is also provided.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-11.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Day 1 Start</h2>
<p class="First">The dosage of ORTHO-CEPT<span class="Sup">®</span> for the initial cycle of therapy is one light orange "active" tablet administered daily from the 1st day through the 21st day of the menstrual cycle, counting the first day of menstrual flow as "Day 1". Tablets are taken without interruption as follows: One light orange "active" tablet daily for 21 days, then one green "reminder" tablet daily for 7 days. After 28 tablets have been taken, a new course is started and a light orange "active" tablet is taken the next day.</p>
<p>The use of ORTHO-CEPT<span class="Sup">®</span> for contraception may be initiated 4 weeks postpartum in women who elect not to breastfeed. When the tablets are administered during the postpartum period, the increased risk of thromboembolic disease associated with the postpartum period must be considered. (See <a href="#contra">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a> and <a href="#warnings">WARNINGS</a> concerning thromboembolic disease. See also <a href="#nursing">PRECAUTIONS: Nursing Mothers</a>.) If the patient starts on ORTHO-CEPT<span class="Sup">®</span> postpartum, and has not yet had a period, she should be instructed to use another method of contraception until a light orange "active" tablet has been taken daily for 7 days. The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered. If the patient misses one (1) light orange "active" tablet in Weeks 1, 2, or 3, the light orange "active" tablet should be taken as soon as she remembers. If the patient misses two (2) light orange "active" tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take two (2) light orange "active" tablets the day she remembers and two (2) light orange "active" tablets the next day; and then continue taking one (1) light orange "active" tablet a day until she finishes the pack. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control such as a condom or spermicide if she has sex in the seven (7) days after missing pills. If the patient misses two (2) light orange "active" tablets in the third week or misses three (3) or more light orange "active" tablets in a row, the patient should throw out the rest of the pack and start a new pack that same day. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control if she has sex in the seven (7) days after missing pills.</p>

<h2>Sunday Start</h2>
<p class="First">When taking ORTHO-CEPT<span class="Sup">®</span>, the first light orange "active" tablet should be taken on the first Sunday after menstruation begins. If the period begins on Sunday, the first light orange "active" tablet is taken on that day. If switching directly from another oral contraceptive, the first light orange "active" tablet should be taken on the first Sunday after the last ACTIVE tablet of the previous product. Tablets are taken without interruption as follows: One light orange "active" tablet daily for 21 days, then one green "reminder" tablet daily for 7 days. After 28 tablets have been taken, a new course is started and a light orange "active" tablet is taken the next day (Sunday). When initiating a Sunday start regimen, another method of contraception should be used until after the first 7 consecutive days of administration.</p>
<p>The use of ORTHO-CEPT<span class="Sup">®</span> for contraception may be initiated 4 weeks postpartum. When the tablets are administered during the postpartum period, the increased risk of thromboembolic disease associated with the postpartum period must be considered. (See <a href="#contra">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a> and <a href="#warnings">WARNINGS</a> concerning thromboembolic disease. See also <a href="#nursing">PRECAUTIONS: Nursing Mothers</a>.) If the patient starts on ORTHO-CEPT<span class="Sup">®</span> postpartum, and has not yet had a period, she should be instructed to use another method of contraception until a light orange "active" tablet has been taken daily for 7 days. The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered. If the patient misses one (1) light orange active tablet in Weeks 1, 2, or 3, the light orange "active" tablet should be taken as soon as she remembers. If the patient misses two (2) light orange "active" tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take two (2) light orange "active" tablets the day she remembers and two (2) light orange "active" tablets the next day; and then continue taking one (1) light orange "active" tablet a day until she finishes the pack. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control such as a condom or spermicide if she has sex in the seven (7) days after missing pills. If the patient misses two (2) light orange "active" tablets in the third week or misses three (3) or more light orange "active" tablets in a row, the patient should continue taking one light orange "active" tablet every day until Sunday. On Sunday the patient should throw out the rest of the pack and start a new pack that same day. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control if she has sex in the seven (7) days after missing pills.</p>

<h2>ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL DOSING REGIMENS</h2>
<p class="First">Breakthrough <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, spotting, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443800" conceptname="Amenorrhea">amenorrhea</span> are frequent reasons for patients discontinuing oral contraceptives. In breakthrough <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, as in all cases of irregular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> from the vagina, nonfunctional causes should be borne in mind. In undiagnosed persistent or recurrent abnormal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> from the vagina, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated to rule out pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. Changing to an oral contraceptive with a higher estrogen content, while potentially useful in minimizing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196168" conceptname="Irregular periods">menstrual irregularity</span>, should be done only if necessary since this may increase the risk of thromboembolic disease.</p>
<p>Use of oral contraceptives in the event of a missed menstrual period:</p>
<ol class="Arabic">
<li>If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.</li>
<li>If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out.</li>

<p>Oral contraceptives, also known as "birth control pills" or "the pill," are taken to prevent pregnancy, and when taken correctly without missing any pills, have a failure rate of approximately 1% per year. The typical failure rate is approximately 5% per year when women who miss pills are included. For most women, oral contraceptives are also free of serious or unpleasant side effects. However, forgetting to take pills considerably increases the chances of pregnancy.</p>
<p>For the majority of women, oral contraceptives can be taken safely. But there are some women who are at high risk of developing certain serious diseases that can be life-threatening or may cause temporary or permanent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052648" conceptname="Disability">disability</span>. The risks associated with taking oral contraceptives increase significantly if you:</p>

</ul>
<p>Although cardiovascular disease risks may be increased with oral contraceptive use after age 40 in healthy, non-smoking women (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are also greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women.</p>

<p>The serious side effects of the pill occur very infrequently, especially if you are in good health and are young. However, you should know that the following medical conditions have been associated with or made worse by the pill:</p>
<ol class="Arabic">
<li>Blood clots in the legs (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320741" conceptname="Thrombophlebitis">thrombophlebitis</span>) or lungs (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440417" conceptname="Pulmonary embolism">pulmonary embolism</span>), stoppage or rupture of a blood vessel in the brain (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>), blockage of blood vessels in the heart (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321318" conceptname="Angina pectoris">angina pectoris</span>) or other organs of the body. As mentioned above, smoking increases the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">heart attacks</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">strokes</span>, and subsequent serious medical consequences.</li>
<li>In rare cases, oral contraceptives can cause benign but dangerous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322895" conceptname="Nodule of liver">liver tumors</span>. These benign <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322895" conceptname="Nodule of liver">liver tumors</span> can rupture and cause fatal internal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>. In addition, some studies report an increased risk of developing liver cancer. However, liver cancers are rare.</li>
<li>High blood pressure, although blood pressure usually returns to normal when the pill is stopped.</li>
</ol>
<p>The symptoms associated with these serious side effects are discussed in the detailed patient labeling given to you with your supply of pills. Notify your healthcare professional if you notice any unusual physical disturbances while taking the pill. In addition, drugs such as rifampin, bosentan, as well as some <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> medicines and herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (<span class="Italics">Hypericum perforatum</span>) may decrease oral contraceptive effectiveness.</p>
<p>Oral contraceptives may interact with lamotrigine (LAMICTAL<span class="Sup">®</span>), a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> medicine used for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>. This may increase the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> so your healthcare professional may need to adjust the dose of lamotrigine.</p>
<p>Various studies give conflicting reports on the relationship between breast cancer and oral contraceptive use. Oral contraceptive use may slightly increase your chance of having breast cancer diagnosed, particularly after using hormonal contraceptives at a younger age. After you stop using hormonal contraceptives, the chances of having breast cancer diagnosed begin to go back down. You should have regular breast examinations by a healthcare professional and examine your own breasts monthly. Tell your healthcare professional if you have a family history of breast cancer or if you have had breast <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4101098" conceptname="Nodule">nodules</span> or an abnormal mammogram. Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use oral contraceptives because breast cancer is usually a hormone-sensitive tumor.</p>
<p>Some studies have found an increase in the incidence of cancer of the cervix in women who use oral contraceptives. However, this finding may be related to factors other than the use of oral contraceptives. There is insufficient evidence to rule out the possibility that the pill may cause such cancers.</p>
<p>Taking the pill provides some important non-contraceptive benefits. These include less painful menstruation, less menstrual blood loss and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span>, fewer <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4003306" conceptname="Infection of pelvis">pelvic infections</span>, and fewer cancers of the ovary and the lining of the uterus.</p>
<p>Be sure to discuss any medical condition you may have with your healthcare professional. Your healthcare professional will take a medical and family history before prescribing oral contraceptives and will examine you. The physical examination may be delayed to another time if you request it and the healthcare professional believes that it is a good medical practice to postpone it. You should be reexamined at least once a year while taking oral contraceptives. The detailed patient information labeling gives you further information which you should read and discuss with your healthcare professional.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<p>Any woman who considers using oral contraceptives (the birth control pill or the pill) should understand the benefits and risks of using this form of birth control. This patient labeling will give you much of the information you will need to make this decision and will also help you determine if you are at risk of developing any of the serious side effects of the pill. It will tell you how to use the pill properly so that it will be as effective as possible. However, this labeling is not a replacement for a careful discussion between you and your healthcare professional. You should discuss the information provided in this labeling with him or her, both when you first start taking the pill and during your revisits. You should also follow your healthcare professional's advice with regard to regular check-ups while you are on the pill.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">EFFECTIVENESS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES</span></p>
<p>Oral contraceptives or "birth control pills" or "the pill" are used to prevent pregnancy and are more effective than most other non-surgical methods of birth control. When they are taken correctly without missing any pills, the chance of becoming pregnant is approximately 1% (1 pregnancy per 100 women per year of use). Typical failure rates, including women who do not always take the pills exactly as directed, are approximately 5% per year. The chance of becoming pregnant increases with each missed pill during a menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>In comparison, typical failure rates for other non-surgical methods of birth control during the first year of use are as follows:</p>

<p><span class="Bold">RISKS OF TAKING ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">1. Risk of Developing Blood Clots</span></p>
<p>Blood clots and blockage of blood vessels are one of the most serious side effects of taking oral contraceptives and can cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> or serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052648" conceptname="Disability">disability</span>. In particular, a clot in the legs can cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320741" conceptname="Thrombophlebitis">thrombophlebitis</span> and a clot that travels to the lungs can cause a sudden blocking of the vessel carrying blood to the lungs. The risks of these side effects may be greater with desogestrel-containing oral contraceptives, such as ORTHO-CEPT<span class="Sup">®</span>, than with certain other low-dose pills. Rarely, clots occur in the blood vessels of the eye and may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377551" conceptname="Blind hypertensive eye">blindness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373474" conceptname="Diplopia">double vision</span>, or impaired vision.</p>
<p>If you take oral contraceptives and need elective surgery, need to stay in bed for a prolonged illness or injury or have recently delivered a baby, you may be at risk of developing blood clots. You should consult your healthcare professional about stopping oral contraceptives three to four weeks before surgery and not taking oral contraceptives for two weeks after surgery or during bed rest. You should also not take oral contraceptives soon after delivery of a baby. It is advisable to wait for at least four weeks after delivery if you are not breastfeeding. If you are breastfeeding, you should wait until you have weaned your child before using the pill. (See also the section on <a href="#breastfeed">Breastfeeding in General Precautions</a>.)</p>
<p>The risk of circulatory disease in oral contraceptive users may be higher in users of high-dose pills. The risk of venous thromboembolic disease associated with oral contraceptives does not increase with length of use and disappears after pill use is stopped. The risk of abnormal blood clotting increases with age in both users and nonusers of oral contraceptives, but the increased risk from the oral contraceptive appears to be present at all ages. For women aged 20 to 44 it is estimated that about 1 in 2,000 using oral contraceptives will be hospitalized each year because of abnormal clotting. Among nonusers in the same age group, about 1 in 20,000 would be hospitalized each year. For oral contraceptive users in general, it has been estimated that in women between the ages of 15 and 34 the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> due to a circulatory disorder is about 1 in 12,000 per year, whereas for nonusers the rate is about 1 in 50,000 per year. In the age group 35 to 44, the risk is estimated to be about 1 in 2,500 per year for oral contraceptive users and about 1 in 10,000 per year for nonusers.</p>

<p>Oral contraceptives may increase the tendency to develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">strokes</span> (stoppage or rupture of blood vessels in the brain) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321318" conceptname="Angina pectoris">angina pectoris</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">heart attacks</span> (blockage of blood vessels in the heart). Any of these conditions can cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> or serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052648" conceptname="Disability">disability</span>.</p>
<p>Smoking greatly increases the possibility of suffering <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">heart attacks</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">strokes</span>. Furthermore, smoking and the use of oral contraceptives greatly increase the chances of developing and dying of heart disease.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">3. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192353" conceptname="Disorder of gallbladder">Gallbladder Disease</span></span></p>
<p>Oral contraceptive users probably have a greater risk than nonusers of having <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192353" conceptname="Disorder of gallbladder">gallbladder disease</span>, although this risk may be related to pills containing high doses of estrogens.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">4. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322895" conceptname="Nodule of liver">Liver Tumors</span></span></p>
<p>In rare cases, oral contraceptives can cause benign but dangerous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322895" conceptname="Nodule of liver">liver tumors</span>. These benign <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322895" conceptname="Nodule of liver">liver tumors</span> can rupture and cause fatal internal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>. In addition, some studies report an increased risk of developing liver cancer. However, liver cancers are rare.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">5. Cancer of the Reproductive Organs and Breasts</span></p>
<p>Various studies give conflicting reports on the relationship between breast cancer and oral contraceptive use. Oral contraceptive use may slightly increase your chance of having breast cancer diagnosed, particularly after using hormonal contraceptives at a younger age. After you stop using hormonal contraceptives, the chances of having breast cancer diagnosed begin to go back down. You should have regular breast examinations by a healthcare professional and examine your own breasts monthly. Tell your healthcare professional if you have a family history of breast cancer or if you have had breast <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4101098" conceptname="Nodule">nodules</span> or an abnormal mammogram. Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use oral contraceptives because breast cancer is usually a hormone-sensitive tumor.</p>
<p>Some studies have found an increase in the incidence of cancer of the cervix in women who use oral contraceptives. However, this finding may be related to factors other than the use of oral contraceptives. There is insufficient evidence to rule out the possibility that pills may cause such cancers.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">ESTIMATED RISK OF <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">DEATH</span> FROM A BIRTH CONTROL METHOD OR PREGNANCY</span></p>
<p>All methods of birth control and pregnancy are associated with a risk of developing certain diseases which may lead to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052648" conceptname="Disability">disability</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.

</table>
<p>In the above table, the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> from any birth control method is less than the risk of childbirth, except for oral contraceptive users over the age of 35 who smoke and pill users over the age of 40 even if they do not smoke. It can be seen in the table that for women aged 15 to 39, the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> was highest with pregnancy (7–26 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> per 100,000 women, depending on age). Among pill users who do not smoke, the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> is always lower than that associated with pregnancy for any age group, although over the age of 40, the risk increases to 32 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> per 100,000 women, compared to 28 associated with pregnancy at that age. However, for pill users who smoke and are over the age of 35, the estimated number of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> exceeds those for other methods of birth control. If a woman is over the age of 40 and smokes, her estimated risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> is four times higher (117/100,000 women) than the estimated risk associated with pregnancy (28/100,000 women) in that age group.</p>
<p>The suggestion that women over 40 who do not smoke should not take oral contraceptives is based on information from older, higher-dose pills. An Advisory Committee of the FDA discussed this issue in 1989 and recommended that the benefits of low-dose oral contraceptive use by healthy, non-smoking women over 40 years of age may outweigh the possible risks. Older women, as all women, who take oral contraceptives, should take an oral contraceptive which contains the least amount of estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with the individual patient needs.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">1. Missed Periods and Use of Oral Contraceptives Before or During Early Pregnancy</span></p>
<p>There may be times when you may not menstruate regularly after you have completed taking a cycle of pills. If you have taken your pills regularly and miss one menstrual period, continue taking your pills for the next cycle but be sure to inform your healthcare professional before doing so. If you have not taken the pills daily as instructed and missed a menstrual period, you may be pregnant. If you missed two consecutive menstrual periods, you may be pregnant. Check with your healthcare professional immediately to determine whether you are pregnant. Stop taking oral contraceptives if pregnancy is confirmed.</p>
<p>There is no conclusive evidence that oral contraceptive use is associated with an increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span>, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Previously, a few studies had reported that oral contraceptives might be associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span>, but these findings have not been seen in more recent studies. Nevertheless, oral contraceptives should not be used during pregnancy. You should check with your healthcare professional about risks to your unborn child of any medication taken during pregnancy.</p>
<p><a name="breastfeed"></a><span class="Bold">2. While Breastfeeding</span></p>
<p>If you are breastfeeding, consult your healthcare professional before starting oral contraceptives. Some of the drug will be passed on to the child in the milk. A few adverse effects on the child have been reported, including yellowing of the skin (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span>) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="78474" conceptname="Hypertrophy of breast">breast enlargement</span>. In addition, oral contraceptives may decrease the amount and quality of your milk. If possible, do not use oral contraceptives while breastfeeding. You should use another method of contraception since breastfeeding provides only partial protection from becoming pregnant and this partial protection decreases significantly as you breastfeed for longer periods of time. You should consider starting oral contraceptives only after you have weaned your child completely.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">3. Laboratory Tests</span></p>
<p>If you are scheduled for any laboratory tests, tell your healthcare professional you are taking birth control pills. Certain blood tests may be affected by birth control pills.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">4. Drug Interactions</span></p>
<p>Tell your healthcare provider about all medicines and herbal products that you take.</p>
<p>Some medicines and herbal products may make hormonal birth control less effective, including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul class="DIsc">
<li>certain <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> medicines (carbamazepine, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, rufinamide, and topiramate)</li>
<li>aprepitant</li>
<li>barbiturates</li>
<li>bosentan</li>
<li>colesevelam</li>
<li>griseofulvin</li>
<li>certain combinations of HIV medicines (nelfinavir, ritonavir, ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors)</li>
<li>certain non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nevirapine)</li>
<li>rifampin and rifabutin</li>
<li>St. John's wort</li>
</ul>
<p>Use another birth control method (such as a condom and spermicide or diaphragm and spermicide) when you take medicines that may make ORTHO-CEPT<span class="Sup">®</span> less effective.</p>
<p>Some medicines and grapefruit juice may increase your level of the hormone ethinyl estradiol if used together, including:</p>
<ul class="Disc">
<li>acetaminophen</li>
<li>ascorbic acid</li>
<li>medicines that affect how your liver breaks down other medicines (itraconazole, ketoconazole, voriconazole, and fluconazole)</li>
<li>certain HIV medicines (atazanavir, indinavir)</li>
<li>atorvastatin</li>
<li>rosuvastatin</li>
<li>etravirine</li>
</ul>
<p>Hormonal birth control methods may interact with lamotrigine, a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> medicine used for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>. This may increase the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>, so your healthcare provider may need to adjust the dose of lamotrigine.</p>
<p>Women on thyroid replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone.</p>
<p>Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show your doctor and pharmacist when you get a new medicine.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">PREGNANCY DUE TO PILL FAILURE</span></p>
<p>When taken correctly without missing any pills, oral contraceptives are highly effective; however the typical failure rate of large numbers of pill users is 5% per year when women who miss pills are included. If failure does occur, the risk to the fetus is minimal.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">PREGNANCY AFTER STOPPING THE PILL</span></p>
<p>There may be some delay in becoming pregnant after you stop using oral contraceptives, especially if you had <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196168" conceptname="Irregular periods">irregular menstrual cycles</span> before you used oral contraceptives. It may be advisable to postpone conception until you begin menstruating regularly once you have stopped taking the pill and desire pregnancy.</p>
<p>There does not appear to be any increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span> in newborn babies when pregnancy occurs soon after stopping the pill.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span></p>
<p>Serious ill effects have not been reported following ingestion of large doses of oral contraceptives by young children. Overdosage may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4161407" conceptname="Withdrawal bleeding">withdrawal bleeding</span> in females. In case of overdosage, contact your healthcare professional.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">OTHER INFORMATION</span></p>
<p>Your healthcare professional will take a medical and family history before prescribing oral contraceptives and will examine you. The physical examination may be delayed to another time if you request it and the healthcare professional believes that it is a good medical practice to postpone it. You should be reexamined at least once a year. Be sure to inform your healthcare professional if there is a family history of any of the conditions listed previously in this leaflet. Be sure to keep all appointments with your healthcare professional because this is a time to determine if there are early signs of side effects of oral contraceptive use.</p>
<p>Do not use the drug for any condition other than the one for which it was prescribed. This drug has been prescribed specifically for you; do not give it to others who may want birth control pills.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">HEALTH BENEFITS FROM ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES</span></p>
<p>In addition to preventing pregnancy, use of combined oral contraceptives may provide certain benefits. They are:</p>
<ul class="Disc">
<li>menstrual cycles may become more regular</li>
<li>blood flow during menstruation may be lighter and less iron may be lost. Therefore, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span> due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4146209" conceptname="Iron deficiency">iron deficiency</span> is less likely to occur.</li>
<li><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> or other symptoms during menstruation may be encountered less frequently</li>
<li>ectopic (tubal) pregnancy may occur less frequently</li>
<li>noncancerous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4209224" conceptname="Cyst">cysts</span> or lumps in the breast may occur less frequently</li>
<li>acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="199067" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of female pelvic organs AND/OR tissues">pelvic inflammatory disease</span> may occur less frequently</li>
<li>oral contraceptive use may provide some protection against developing two forms of cancer: cancer of the ovaries and cancer of the lining of the uterus.</li>
</ul>
