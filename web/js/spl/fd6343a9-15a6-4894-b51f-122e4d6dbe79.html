<h2>MECHANISM OF ACTION:</h2>
<p class="First">Product releases lidocaine to stabilize the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action. Hydrocortisone acetate provides relief of inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid responsive dermatoses. Lidocaine is chemically designated as acetamide,
2-(diethylamino)- N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl), and has the following structure:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="structure" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=fd6343a9-15a6-4894-b51f-122e4d6dbe79&amp;name=structure.jpg"></div>
<p>Hydrocortisone acetate has a chemical name pregn-4-ene-3, 20-dione, 21-(acetyloxy)- 11,17- dihydroxy-(11ÃŸ)-. It has the following structural formula:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="structure2" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=fd6343a9-15a6-4894-b51f-122e4d6dbe79&amp;name=structure2.jpg"></div>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="43682-4">
<a name="section-4.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>PHARMACOKINETICS:</h2>
<p class="First">Lidocaine may be absorbed following topical administration to mucous membranes, its rate and extent of absorption depending upon the specific site of application, duration of exposure, concentration, and total dosage. In general, the rate of absorption of local anesthetic agents following topical application occurs most rapidly after
intratracheal administration. Lidocaine is also well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but little intact drug appears in the circulation because of biotransformation in the liver.</p>
<p>Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The
pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are, similar to but less potent than, those of lidocaine. Approximately 90% of lidocaine administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2, 6-dimethylaniline. The plasma binding of lidocaine is
dependent on drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 g of free base per mL, 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion.</p>
<p>Studies of lidocaine metabolism following intravenous bolus injections have shown that the elimination half-life of this agent is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver
dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidosis</span> and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous
plasma levels above 6 g free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18-21 g/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity.</p>
<p>The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings.</p>
<p>Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">Inflammation</span> and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant
dermatoses.</p>
<p>Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma protein in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and
their metabolites are also excreted into the bile.</p>

<h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h1>
<p class="First">Product should not be used in patients with a history of sensitivity to any of its ingredients or adverse reactions to lidocaine or amide anesthetics, which usually do not cross-react with â€œcaineâ€? ester type anesthetics. If excessive irritation and significant worsening occur, discontinue use and seek the advice of your physician.
Product and topical lidocaine should be used cautiously in those with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4326594" conceptname="Abnormal liver function">impaired liver function</span>, as well as the very ill or very elderly and those with significant liver disease. Product should be used with caution on patients receiving antiarrhythmic drugs of Class I since the adverse effects are additive and generally synergistic. These products are
contraindicated for tuberculous or fungal lesions or skin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140633" conceptname="Vaccinia">vaccinia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434272" conceptname="Varicella">varicella</span> and acute herpes simplex. Topical corticosteroids are contraindicated in those patients with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> to any of the components of the preparation.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS:</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">For external use only. Not for ophthalmic use.</span></p>
<p>   Product, applicators and moist wipes could harm small children if chewed or swallowed.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Keep product, moist wipes and applicators out of the reach of children.</span></p>
<p>Topical formulations of lidocaine may be absorbed to a greater extent through mucous membranes and abraded, fissured or irritated skin than through intact skin. Product should not be ingested or applied into the mouth, inside of the nose or in the eyes. Product should not be used in the ears. Any situation where lidocaine penetrates beyond the tympanic
membrane into the middle ear is contraindicated because of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4236623" conceptname="Ototoxicity">ototoxicity</span> associated with lidocaine observed in animals when instilled in the middle ear. Product should not come into contact with the eye or be applied into the eye because of the risk of severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4049206" conceptname="Burning sensation in eye">eye irritation</span> and the loss of eye surface sensation which reduces protective reflexes and can
lead to corneal irritation and possibly <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4269361" conceptname="Friction burn">abrasion</span>. If eye contact occurs, rinse out the eye immediately with saline or water and protect the eye surface until sensation is restored.</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS:</h1>
<p class="First">If irritation or sensitivity occurs or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> appears, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. If extensive areas are treated, the possibility of systemic absorption exists. Systemic absorption of topical steroids has produced reversible hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushingâ€™s syndrome, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434164" conceptname="Glycosuria">glycosuria</span> in some patients. Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings. Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of potent topical steroids applied to a large surface area, or under an occlusive dressing, should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. If noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid.</p>
<p>Recovery of the HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Children may absorb proportionately larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity. If irritation develops, topical steroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. In the presence of dermatological <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span>, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, the corticosteroid should be discontinued until the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> has been adequately controlled.</p>

<h1>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, AND IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY:</h1>
<p class="First">Long-term
animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential or the effect on fertility of topical corticosteroids. Studies to determine mutagenicity with prednisolone and hydrocortisone have revealed negative results. Studies of lidocaine in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic and mutagenic potential of the
effect on fertility have not been conducted.</p>

<h1>USE IN PREGNANCY:</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34077-8">
<a name="section-10.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Teratogenic Effects:</h2>
<p class="First">Pregnancy Category C. Reproduction studies have been performed for lidocaine in rats at doses up to 6.6 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus caused by lidocaine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal
reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. General consideration should be given to this fact before administering lidocaine to women of childbearing potential, especially during early pregnancy when maximum organogenesis takes place. Corticosteroids are generally teratogenic in laboratory
animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. The more potent corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from topically applied corticosteroids. Therefore, topical
corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Drugs of this class should not be used extensively on pregnant patients, in large amounts, or for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4088438" conceptname="Prolonged periods">prolonged periods</span> of time.</p>
