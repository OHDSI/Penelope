<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">CARNITOR<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (levocarnitine) is a naturally occurring substance required in mammalian energy metabolism. It has been shown to facilitate long-chain fatty acid entry into cellular mitochondria, thereby delivering substrate for oxidation and subsequent energy production. Fatty acids are utilized as an energy substrate in all tissues except the brain. In skeletal and cardiac muscle, fatty acids are the main substrate for energy production.</p>
<p>Primary systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228429" conceptname="Carnitine deficiency">carnitine deficiency</span> is characterized by low concentrations of levocarnitine in plasma, RBC, and/or tissues. It has not been possible to determine which symptoms are due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228429" conceptname="Carnitine deficiency">carnitine deficiency</span> and which are due to an underlying organic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidemia</span>, as symptoms of both abnormalities may be expected to improve with CARNITOR<span class="Sup">Â®</span>. The literature reports that carnitine can promote the excretion of excess organic or fatty acids in patients with defects in fatty acid metabolism and/or specific organic acidopathies that bioaccumulate acylCoA esters.<span class="Sup">1-6</span></p>
<p>Secondary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228429" conceptname="Carnitine deficiency">carnitine deficiency</span> can be a consequence of inborn errors of metabolism. CARNITOR<span class="Sup">Â®</span> may alleviate the metabolic abnormalities of patients with inborn errors that result in accumulation of toxic organic acids. Conditions for which this effect has been demonstrated are: glutaric aciduria II, methyl malonic aciduria, propionic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidemia</span>, and medium chain fatty acylCoA dehydrogenase deficiency.<span class="Sup">7,8</span> Autointoxication occurs in these patients due to the accumulation of acylCoA compounds that disrupt intermediary metabolism. The subsequent hydrolysis of the acylCoA compound to its free acid results in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidosis</span> which can be life-threatening. Levocarnitine clears the acylCoA compound by formation of acylcarnitine, which is quickly excreted. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228429" conceptname="Carnitine deficiency">Carnitine deficiency</span> is defined biochemically as abnormally low plasma concentrations of free carnitine, less than 20 Âµmol/L at one week post term and may be associated with low tissue and/or urine concentrations. Further, this condition may be associated with a plasma concentration ratio of acylcarnitine/levocarnitine greater than 0.4 or abnormally elevated concentrations of acylcarnitine in the urine. In premature infants and newborns, secondary deficiency is defined as plasma levocarnitine concentrations below age-related normal concentrations.</p>

<h1>PHARMACOKINETICS</h1>
<p class="First">In a relative bioavailability study in 15 healthy adult male volunteers, CARNITOR<span class="Sup">Â®</span> Tablets were found to be bio-equivalent to CARNITOR<span class="Sup">Â®</span> Oral Solution. Following 4 days of dosing with 6 tablets of CARNITOR<span class="Sup">Â®</span> 330 mg b.i.d. or 2 g of CARNITOR<span class="Sup">Â®</span> oral solution b.i.d., the maximum plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) was about 80 Âµmol/L and the time to maximum plasma concentration (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) occurred at 3.3 hours.</p>
<p>The plasma concentration profiles of levocarnitine after a slow 3 minute intravenous bolus dose of 20 mg/kg of CARNITOR<span class="Sup">Â®</span> were described by a two-compartment model. Following a single i.v. administration, approximately 76% of the levocarnitine dose was excreted in the urine during the 0-24h interval. Using plasma concentrations uncorrected for endogenous levocarnitine, the mean distribution half life was 0.585 hours and the mean apparent terminal elimination half life was 17.4 hours.</p>
<p>The absolute bioavailability of levocarnitine from the two oral formulations of CARNITOR<span class="Sup">Â®</span>, calculated after correction for circulating endogenous plasma concentrations of levocarnitine, was 15.1 Â± 5.3% for CARNITOR<span class="Sup">Â®</span> Tablets and 15.9 Â± 4.9% for CARNITOR<span class="Sup">Â®</span> Oral Solution.</p>
<p>Total body clearance of levocarnitine (Dose/AUC including endogenous baseline concentrations) was a mean of 4.00 L/h.</p>
<p>Levocarnitine was not bound to plasma protein or albumin when tested at any concentration or with any species including the human.<span class="Sup">9</span></p>

<h1>METABOLISM AND EXCRETION</h1>
<p class="First">In a pharmacokinetic study where five normal adult male volunteers received an oral dose of [<span class="Sup">3</span>H-methyl]-L-carnitine following 15 days of a high carnitine diet and additional carnitine supplement, 58 to 65% of the administered radioactive dose was recovered in the urine and feces in 5 to 11 days. Maximum concentration of [<span class="Sup">3</span>H-methyl]-L-carnitine in serum occurred from 2.0 to 4.5 hr after drug administration. Major metabolites found were trimethylamine N-oxide, primarily in urine (8% to 49% of the administered dose) and [<span class="Sup">3</span>H]-Î³-butyrobetaine, primarily in feces (0.44% to 45% of the administered dose). Urinary excretion of levocarnitine was about 4 to 8% of the dose. Fecal excretion of total carnitine was less than 1% of the administered dose.<span class="Sup">10</span></p>
<p>After attainment of steady state following 4 days of oral administration of CARNITOR<span class="Sup">Â®</span> Tablets (1980 mg q12h) or Oral Solution (2000 mg q12h) to 15 healthy male volunteers, the mean urinary excretion of levocarnitine during a single dosing interval (12h) was about 9% of the orally administered dose (uncorrected for endogenous urinary excretion).</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">CARNITOR<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (levocarnitine) is indicated in the treatment of primary systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228429" conceptname="Carnitine deficiency">carnitine deficiency</span>. In the reported cases, the clinical presentation consisted of recurrent episodes of Reye-like <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372887" conceptname="Disorder of brain">encephalopathy</span>, hypoketotic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>, and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321319" conceptname="Cardiomyopathy">cardiomyopathy</span>. Associated symptoms included <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">hypotonia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79908" conceptname="Muscle weakness">muscle weakness</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437986" conceptname="Failure to thrive">failure to thrive</span>. A diagnosis of primary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228429" conceptname="Carnitine deficiency">carnitine deficiency</span> requires that serum, red cell and/or tissue carnitine levels be low and that the patient does not have a primary defect in fatty acid or organic acid oxidation (see Clinical Pharmacology). In some patients, particularly those presenting with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321319" conceptname="Cardiomyopathy">cardiomyopathy</span>, carnitine supplementation rapidly alleviated signs and symptoms. Treatment should include, in addition to carnitine, supportive and other therapy as indicated by the condition of the patient.</p>
<p>CARNITOR<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (levocarnitine) is also indicated for acute and chronic treatment of patients with an inborn error of metabolism which results in a secondary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228429" conceptname="Carnitine deficiency">carnitine deficiency</span>.</p>
