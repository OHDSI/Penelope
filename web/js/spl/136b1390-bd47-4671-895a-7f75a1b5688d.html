<h2>COMBINED ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES</h2>
<p class="First">Combined oral contraceptives act by suppression of gonadotropins. Although the primary mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other alterations include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus) and the endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation).</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">NECON 7/7/7<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets </span>are indicated for the prevention of pregnancy in women who elect to use this product as a method of contraception.</p>
<p>Oral contraceptives are highly effective. Table I lists the typical accidental pregnancy rates for users of combined oral contraceptives and other methods of contraception. The efficacy of these contraceptive methods, except sterilization, the IUD, and the NORPLANT<span class="Sup">®</span> System depends upon the reliability with which they are used. Correct and consistent use of methods can result in lower failure rates.</p>

<p>Practitioners prescribing oral contraceptives should be familiar with the following information relating to these risks.</p>
<p>The information contained in this package insert is principally based on studies carried out in patients who used oral contraceptives with higher formulations of estrogens and progestogens than those in common use today. The effect of long-term use of the oral contraceptives with lower formulations of both estrogens and progestogens remains to be determined.</p>
<p>Throughout this labeling, epidemiological studies reported are of two types: retrospective or case control studies and prospective or cohort studies. Case control studies provide a measure of the relative risk of a disease, namely, a <span class="Italics">ratio</span> of the incidence of a disease among oral contraceptive users to that among nonusers. The relative risk does not provide information on the actual clinical occurrence of a disease. Cohort studies provide a measure of attributable risk, which is the <span class="Italics">difference</span> in the incidence of disease between oral contraceptive users and nonusers. The attributable risk does provide information about the actual occurrence of a disease in the population (adapted from refs. 2 and 3 with the author's permission). For further information, the reader is referred to a text on epidemiological methods.</p>

<p>In a large study, the relative risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4159140" conceptname="Thrombotic stroke">thrombotic strokes</span> has been shown to range from 3 for normotensive users to 14 for users with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>.<span class="Sup">30</span> The relative risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4046362" conceptname="Hemorrhagic cerebral infarction">hemorrhagic stroke</span> is reported to be 1.2 for non-smokers who used oral contraceptives, 2.6 for smokers who did not use oral contraceptives, 7.6 for smokers who used oral contraceptives, 1.8 for normotensive users and 25.7 for users with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>.<span class="Sup">30</span> The attributable risk is also greater in older women.<span class="Sup">3</span></p>

<h3>d.	Dose-related risk of vascular disease from oral contraceptives</h3>
<p class="First">A positive association has been observed between the amount of estrogen and progestogen in oral contraceptives and the risk of vascular disease.<span class="Sup">31–33</span> A decline in serum high density lipoproteins (HDL) has been reported with many progestational agents.<span class="Sup">14–16</span> A decline in serum high density lipoproteins has been associated with an increased incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4124683" conceptname="Silent myocardial ischemia">ischemic heart disease</span>. Because estrogens increase HDL <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>, the net effect of an oral contraceptive depends on a balance achieved between doses of estrogen and progestogen and the activity of the progestogen used in the contraceptives. The activity and amount of both hormones should be considered in the choice of an oral contraceptive.</p>
<p>Minimizing exposure to estrogen and progestogen is in keeping with good principles of therapeutics. For any particular estrogen/progestogen combination, the dosage regimen prescribed should be one which contains the least amount of estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate and the needs of the individual patient. New acceptors of oral contraceptive agents should be started on preparations containing the lowest estrogen content which is judged appropriate for the individual patient.</p>

<h3>e.	Persistence of risk of vascular disease</h3>
<p class="First">There are two studies which have shown persistence of risk of vascular disease for ever-users of oral contraceptives. In a study in the United States, the risk of developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> after discontinuing oral contraceptives persists for at least 9 years for women 40–49 years who had used oral contraceptives for five or more years, but this increased risk was not demonstrated in other age groups.<span class="Sup">8</span> In another study in Great Britain, the risk of developing cerebrovascular disease persisted for at least 6 years after discontinuation of oral contraceptives, although excess risk was very small.<span class="Sup">34</span> However, both studies were performed with oral contraceptive formulations containing 50 micrograms or higher of estrogens.</p>

<h2>2. ESTIMATES OF MORTALITY FROM CONTRACEPTIVE USE</h2>
<p class="First">One study gathered data from a variety of sources which have estimated the mortality rate associated with different methods of contraception at different ages (Table III). These estimates include the combined risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> associated with contraceptive methods plus the risk attributable to pregnancy in the event of method failure. Each method of contraception has its specific benefits and risks. The study concluded that with the exception of oral contraceptive users 35 and older who smoke, and 40 and older who do not smoke, mortality associated with all methods of birth control is low and below that associated with childbirth. The observation of an increase in risk of mortality with age for oral contraceptive users is based on data gathered in the 1970's.<span class="Sup">35</span> Current clinical recommendation involves the use of lower estrogen dose formulations and a careful consideration of risk factors. In 1989, the Fertility and Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee was asked to review the use of oral contraceptives in women 40 years of age and over. The Committee concluded that although cardiovascular disease risks may be increased with oral contraceptive use after age 40 in healthy non-smoking women (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are also greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women and with the alternative surgical and medical procedures which may be necessary if such women do not have access to effective and acceptable means of contraception. The Committee recommended that the benefits of low-dose oral contraceptive use by healthy non-smoking women over 40 may outweigh the possible risks.</p>
<p>Of course, older women, as all women who take oral contraceptives, should take an oral contraceptive which contains the least amount of estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate and individual patient needs.</p>

<h2>3. CARCINOMA OF THE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS AND BREASTS</h2>
<p class="First">Numerous epidemiological studies have been performed on the incidence of breast, endometrial, ovarian and cervical cancer in women using oral contraceptives. The risk of having breast cancer diagnosed may be slightly increased among current and recent users of COCs. However, this excess risk appears to decrease over time after COC discontinuation and by 10 years after cessation the increased risk disappears. Some studies report an increased risk with duration of use while other studies do not and no consistent relationships have been found with dose or type of steroid. Some studies have found a small increase in risk for women who first use COCs before age 20. Most studies show a similar pattern of risk with COC use regardless of a woman's reproductive history or her family breast cancer history.</p>
<p>Breast cancers diagnosed in current or previous OC users tend to be less clinically advanced than in nonusers.</p>
<p>Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use oral contraceptives because breast cancer is usually a hormonally-sensitive tumor.</p>
<p>Some studies suggest that oral contraceptive use has been associated with an increase in the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198572" conceptname="Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia">cervical intraepithelial neoplasia</span> in some populations of women.<span class="Sup">45–48</span> However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.</p>
<p>In spite of many studies of the relationship between oral contraceptive use and breast and cervical cancers, a cause-and-effect relationship has not been established.</p>

<p class="First">Contraceptive effectiveness may be reduced when hormonal contraceptives are co-administered with antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and other drugs that increase the metabolism of contraceptive steroids. This could result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4307820" conceptname="Unplanned pregnancy">unintended pregnancy</span> or breakthrough <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>. Examples include rifampin, barbiturates, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, griseofulvin and bosentan. Several cases of contraceptive failure and breakthrough <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> have been reported in the literature with concomitant administration of antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracyclines. However, clinical pharmacology studies investigating drug interaction between combined oral contraceptives and these antibiotics have reported inconsistent results.</p>
<p>Several of the anti-HIV protease inhibitors have been studied with co-administration of oral combined hormonal contraceptives; significant changes (increase and decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases. The safety and efficacy of oral contraceptive products may be affected with co-administration of anti-HIV protease inhibitors. Healthcare professionals should refer to the label of the individual anti-HIV protease inhibitors for further drug-drug interaction information.</p>
<p>Herbal products containing St. John's Wort (hypericum perforatum) may induce hepatic enzymes (cytochrome P450) and p-glycoprotein transporter and may reduce the effectiveness of contraceptive steroids. This may also result in breakthrough <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>.</p>
<p>Concurrent use of bosentan and norethisterone/ethinyl estradiol may result in decreased concentrations of these contraceptive hormones, thereby increasing the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4307820" conceptname="Unplanned pregnancy">unintended pregnancy</span> and unscheduled <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>.</p>

<h3>Increase in plasma levels associated with co-administered drugs</h3>
<p class="First">Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol increase AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol levels, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone levels.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-7.8.3"></a><p></p>
<h3>Changes in plasma levels of co-administered drugs</h3>
<p class="First">Combined hormonal contraceptives containing some synthetic estrogens (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. Increased plasma concentrations of cyclosporin, prednisolone, and theophylline have been reported with concomitant administration of oral contraceptives. Decreased plasma concentrations of acetaminophen and increased clearance of temazepam, salicylic acid, morphine and clofibric acid, due to induction of conjugation, have been noted when these drugs were administered with oral contraceptives.</p>
<p>Combined hormonal contraceptives have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine when co-administered due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary.<span class="Sup">95 </span></p>
<p>Healthcare professionals are advised to also refer to prescribing information of co-administered drugs for recommendations regarding management of concomitant therapy.</p>

<h2>9.	INTERACTIONS WITH LABORATORY TESTS</h2>
<p class="First">Certain endocrine and liver function tests and blood components may be affected by oral contraceptives:</p>
<ol class="Littlealpha">
<li>Increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> and factors VII, VIII, IX, and X; decreased antithrombin 3; increased norepinephrine-induced platelet aggregability.</li>
<li>Increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4188578" conceptname="Thyroxine binding globulin">thyroid binding globulin</span> (TBG) leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone, as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 by column or by radioimmunoassay. Free T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG, free T4 concentration is unaltered.</li>
<li>Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum.</li>
<li>Sex-binding globulins are increased and result in elevated levels of total circulating sex steroids and corticoids; however, free or biologically active levels remain unchanged.</li>
<li>Triglycerides may be increased and levels of various other lipids and lipoproteins may be affected.</li>
<li>Glucose tolerance may be decreased.</li>
<li>Serum folate levels may be depressed by oral contraceptive therapy. This may be of clinical significance if a woman becomes pregnant shortly after discontinuing oral contraceptives.</li>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, NECON 7/7/7<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets must be taken exactly as directed and at intervals not exceeding 24 hours. NECON 7/7/7<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets are available in a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443720" conceptname="Blister">blister</span> card with a tablet dispenser which is preset for a Sunday Start. Day 1 Start is also available.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-12.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Sunday Start</h2>
<p class="First">When taking NECON 7/7/7<span class="Sup">®</span>, the first white "active" tablet should be taken on the first Sunday after menstruation begins. If the period begins on Sunday, the first white "active" tablet should be taken that day. Take one active tablet daily for 21 days followed by one green "reminder" tablet daily for 7 days. After 28 tablets have been taken, a new course is started the next day (Sunday). For the first cycle of a Sunday Start regimen, another method of contraception, such as a condom or spermicide, should be used until after the first 7 consecutive days of administration.</p>
<p>If the patient misses one (1) active tablet in Weeks 1, 2, or 3, the tablet should be taken as soon as she remembers. If the patient misses two (2) active tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take two (2) tablets the day she remembers and two (2) tablets the next day; and then continue taking one (1) tablet a day until she finishes the pack. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control, such as a condom or spermicide, if she has sex in the seven (7) days after missing pills. If the patient misses two (2) active tablets in the third week or misses three (3) or more active tablets in a row, the patient should continue taking one tablet every day until Sunday. On Sunday the patient should throw out the rest of the pack and start a new pack that same day. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control if she has sex in the seven (7) days after missing pills.</p>
<p>Complete instructions to facilitate patient counseling on proper pill usage may be found in the Detailed Patient Labeling ("How to Take the Pill" section).</p>

In breakthrough <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, as in all cases of irregular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> from the vagina, nonfunctional causes should be borne in mind. In undiagnosed persistent or recurrent abnormal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> from the vagina, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated to rule out pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. Changing to an oral contraceptive with a higher estrogen content, while potentially useful in minimizing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196168" conceptname="Irregular periods">menstrual irregularity</span>, should be done only if necessary since this may increase the risk of thromboembolic disease.</p>
<p>Use of oral contraceptives in the event of a missed menstrual period:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.</li>
<li>If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out.</li>

<h1>BRIEF SUMMARY PATIENT PACKAGE INSERT</h1>
<p class="First">Oral contraceptives, also known as "birth control pills" or "the pill," are taken to prevent pregnancy and when taken correctly without missing any pills, have a failure rate of approximately 1% per year. The typical failure rate is approximately 5% per year when women who miss pills are included. For most women oral contraceptives are also free of serious or unpleasant side effects. However, forgetting to take pills considerably increases the chances of pregnancy.</p>
<p>For the majority of women, oral contraceptives can be taken safely. But there are some women who are at high risk of developing certain serious diseases that can be fatal or may cause temporary or permanent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052648" conceptname="Disability">disability</span>. The risks associated with taking oral contraceptives increase significantly if you:</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular side effects from oral contraceptive use.

<p>The serious side effects of the pill occur very infrequently, especially if you are in good health and are young. However, you should know that the following medical conditions have been associated with or made worse by the pill:</p>
<ol>
<li>Blood clots in the legs (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320741" conceptname="Thrombophlebitis">thrombophlebitis</span>), lungs (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440417" conceptname="Pulmonary embolism">pulmonary embolism</span>), stoppage or rupture of a blood vessel in the brain (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>), blockage of blood vessels in the heart (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321318" conceptname="Angina pectoris">angina pectoris</span>) or other organs of the body. As mentioned above, smoking increases the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">heart attacks</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">strokes</span> and subsequent serious medical consequences.</li>
<li>In rare cases, oral contraceptives can cause benign but dangerous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322895" conceptname="Nodule of liver">liver tumors</span>. These benign <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322895" conceptname="Nodule of liver">liver tumors</span> can rupture and cause fatal internal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>. In addition, some studies report an increased risk of developing liver cancer. However, liver cancers are rare.</li>
<li>High blood pressure, although blood pressure usually returns to normal when the pill is stopped. </li>
</ol>
<p>The symptoms associated with these serious side effects are discussed in the detailed leaflet given to you with your supply of pills. Notify your healthcare professional if you notice any unusual physical disturbances while taking the pill. In addition, drugs such as rifampin, as well as some anticonvulsants and some antibiotics may decrease oral contraceptive effectiveness.</p>
<p>Oral contraceptives may interact with lamotrigine (LAMICTAL<span class="Sup">®</span>), an anticonvulsant used for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>. This may increase the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> so your healthcare professional may need to adjust the dose of lamotrigine.</p>
<p>Various studies give conflicting reports on the relationship between breast cancer and oral contraceptive use. Oral contraceptive use may slightly increase your chance of having breast cancer diagnosed, particularly after using hormonal contraceptives at a younger age. After you stop using hormonal contraceptives, the chances of having breast cancer diagnosed begin to go back down. You should have regular breast examinations by a healthcare professional and examine your own breasts monthly.</p>
<p>Tell your healthcare professional if you have a family history of breast cancer or if you have had breast <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4101098" conceptname="Nodule">nodules</span> or an abnormal mammogram. Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use oral contraceptives because breast cancer is usually a hormone-sensitive tumor.</p>
<p>Some studies have found an increase in the incidence of cancer of the cervix in women who use oral contraceptives. However, this finding may be related to factors other than the use of oral contraceptives.  There is insufficient evidence to rule out the possibility that the pill may cause such cancers.</p>
<p>Taking the combination pill provides some important non-contraceptive benefits. These include less painful menstruation, less menstrual blood loss and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span>, fewer <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4003306" conceptname="Infection of pelvis">pelvic infections</span>, and fewer cancers of the ovary and the lining of the uterus.</p>
<p>Be sure to discuss any medical condition you may have with your healthcare professional. Your healthcare professional will take a medical and family history before prescribing oral contraceptives and will examine you. The physical examination may be delayed to another time if you request it and the healthcare professional believes that it is a good medical practice to postpone it. You should be reexamined at least once a year while taking oral contraceptives. Your pharmacist should have given you the detailed patient information labeling which gives you further information which you should read and discuss with your healthcare professional.</p>

<h1>DETAILED PATIENT LABELING</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Underline">PLEASE NOTE</span>: This labeling is revised from time to time as important new medical information becomes available. Therefore, please review this labeling carefully.</span></p>
<p>The following oral contraceptive product contains a combination of an estrogen and progestogen, the two kinds of female hormones:</p>
<p><span class="Bold">NECON 7/7/7<span class="Sup">®</span></span></p>
<p>Each white tablet contains 0.5 mg norethindrone and 0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol. Each light peach tablet contains 0.75 mg norethindrone and 0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol. Each peach tablet contains 1 mg norethindrone and 0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol. Each green tablet contains inert ingredients.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<p>Any woman who considers using oral contraceptives (the birth control pill or the pill) should understand the benefits and risks of using this form of birth control. This patient labeling will give you much of the information you will need to make this decision and will also help you determine if you are at risk of developing any of the serious side effects of the pill. It will tell you how to use the pill properly so that it will be as effective as possible. However, this labeling is not a replacement for a careful discussion between you and your healthcare professional. You should discuss the information provided in this labeling with him or her, both when you first start taking the pill and during your revisits. You should also follow your healthcare professional's advice with regard to regular check-ups while you are on the pill.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">EFFECTIVENESS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES</span></p>
<p>Oral contraceptives or "birth control pills" or "the pill" are used to prevent pregnancy and are more effective than other non-surgical methods of birth control. When they are taken correctly without missing any pills, the chance of becoming pregnant is approximately 1% (1 pregnancy per 100 women per year of use). Typical failure rates are approximately 5% per year including women who do not always take the pills exactly as directed. The chance of becoming pregnant increases with each missed pill during a menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>In comparison, typical failure rates for other methods of birth control during the first year of use are as follows:</p>

<p>Women with any of these conditions should be checked often by their healthcare professional if they choose to use oral contraceptives.</p>
<p>Also, be sure to inform your healthcare professional if you smoke or are on any medications.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">RISKS OF TAKING ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">1. Risk of developing blood clots</span></p>
<p>Blood clots and blockage of blood vessels are one of the most serious side effects of taking oral contraceptives and can cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> or serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052648" conceptname="Disability">disability</span>. In particular, a clot in the legs can cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320741" conceptname="Thrombophlebitis">thrombophlebitis</span> and a clot that travels to the lungs can cause a sudden blocking of the vessel carrying blood to the lungs. Rarely, clots occur in the blood vessels of the eye and may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377551" conceptname="Blind hypertensive eye">blindness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373474" conceptname="Diplopia">double vision</span>, or impaired vision.</p>
<p>If you take oral contraceptives and need elective surgery, need to stay in bed for a prolonged illness or injury or have recently delivered a baby, you may be at risk of developing blood clots. You should consult your healthcare professional about stopping oral contraceptives three to four weeks before surgery and not taking oral contraceptives for two weeks after surgery or during bed rest. You should also not take oral contraceptives soon after delivery of a baby. It is advisable to wait for at least four weeks after delivery if you are not breastfeeding or four weeks after a second trimester abortion. If you are breastfeeding, you should wait until you have weaned your child before using the pill. (See also the section on <a href="#breastfeeding">Breastfeeding</a> in General Precautions.)</p>
<p>The risk of circulatory disease in oral contraceptive users may be higher in users of high-dose pills and may be greater with longer duration of oral contraceptive use. In addition, some of these increased risks may continue for a number of years after stopping oral contraceptives. The risk of abnormal blood clotting increases with age in both users and nonusers of oral contraceptives, but the increased risk from the oral contraceptive appears to be present at all ages. For women aged 20 to 44, it is estimated that about 1 in 2,000 using oral contraceptives will be hospitalized each year because of abnormal clotting. Among nonusers in the same age group, about 1 in 20,000 would be hospitalized each year. For oral contraceptive users in general, it has been estimated that in women between the ages of 15 and 34 the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> due to a circulatory disorder is about 1 in 12,000 per year, whereas for nonusers the rate is about 1 in 50,000 per year. In the age group 35 to 44, the risk is estimated to be about 1 in 2,500 per year for oral contraceptive users and about 1 in 10,000 per year for nonusers.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">2. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">Heart attacks</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">strokes</span></span></p>
<p>Oral contraceptives may increase the tendency to develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">strokes</span> (stoppage or rupture of blood vessels in the brain) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321318" conceptname="Angina pectoris">angina pectoris</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">heart attacks</span> (blockage of blood vessels in the heart). Any of these conditions can cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> or serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052648" conceptname="Disability">disability</span>.</p>
<p>Smoking greatly increases the possibility of suffering <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">heart attacks</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">strokes</span>. Furthermore, smoking and the use of oral contraceptives greatly increase the chances of developing and dying of heart disease.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">3. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192353" conceptname="Disorder of gallbladder">Gallbladder disease</span></span></p>
<p>Oral contraceptive users probably have a greater risk than nonusers of having <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192353" conceptname="Disorder of gallbladder">gallbladder disease</span>, although this risk may be related to pills containing high doses of estrogens.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">4. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322895" conceptname="Nodule of liver">Liver tumors</span></span></p>
<p>In rare cases, oral contraceptives can cause benign but dangerous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322895" conceptname="Nodule of liver">liver tumors</span>. These benign <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322895" conceptname="Nodule of liver">liver tumors</span> can rupture and cause fatal internal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>. In addition, some studies report an increased risk of developing liver cancer. However, liver cancers are rare.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">5. Cancer of the reproductive organs and breasts</span></p>
<p>Various studies give conflicting reports on the relationship between breast cancer and oral contraceptive use. Oral contraceptive use may slightly increase your chance of having breast cancer diagnosed, particularly after using hormonal contraceptives at a younger age. After you stop using hormonal contraceptives, the chances of having breast cancer diagnosed begin to go back down. You should have regular breast examinations by a healthcare professional and examine your own breasts monthly. Tell your healthcare professional if you have a family history of breast cancer or if you have had breast <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4101098" conceptname="Nodule">nodules</span> or an abnormal mammogram. Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use oral contraceptives because breast cancer is usually a hormone-sensitive tumor.</p>
<p>Some studies have found an increase in the incidence of cancer of the cervix in women who use oral contraceptives. However, this finding may be related to factors other than the use of oral contraceptives. There is insufficient evidence to rule out the possibility that the pill may cause such cancers.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">ESTIMATED RISK OF <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">DEATH</span> FROM A BIRTH CONTROL METHOD OR PREGNANCY</span></p>
<p>All methods of birth control and pregnancy are associated with a risk of developing certain diseases which may lead to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052648" conceptname="Disability">disability</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.

</table>
<p>In the above table, the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> from any birth control method is less than the risk of childbirth, except for oral contraceptive users over the age of 35 who smoke and pill users over the age of 40 even if they do not smoke. It can be seen in the table that for women aged 15 to 39, the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> was highest with pregnancy (7–26 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> per 100,000 women, depending on age). Among pill users who do not smoke, the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> was always lower than that associated with pregnancy for any age group, although over the age of 40, the risk increases to 32 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> per 100,000 women, compared to 28 associated with pregnancy at that age. However, for pill users who smoke and are over the age of 35, the estimated number of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> exceeds those for other methods of birth control. If a woman is over the age of 40 and smokes, her estimated risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> is four times higher (117/100,000 women) than the estimated risk associated with pregnancy (28/100,000 women) in that age group.</p>
<p>The suggestion that women over 40 who do not smoke should not take oral contraceptives is based on information from older, higher-dose pills. An Advisory Committee of the FDA discussed this issue in 1989 and recommended that the benefits of low-dose oral contraceptive use by healthy, non-smoking women over 40 years of age may outweigh the possible risks.</p>

<p>If any of these side effects bother you, call your healthcare professional.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">GENERAL PRECAUTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">1. Missed periods and use of oral contraceptives before or during early pregnancy</span></p>
<p>There may be times when you may not menstruate regularly after you have completed taking a cycle of pills. If you have taken your pills regularly and miss one menstrual period, continue taking your pills for the next cycle but be sure to inform your healthcare professional before doing so. If you have not taken the pills daily as instructed and missed a menstrual period, you may be pregnant. If you missed two consecutive menstrual periods, you may be pregnant. Check with your healthcare professional immediately to determine whether you are pregnant. Do not continue to take oral contraceptives until you are sure you are not pregnant, but continue to use another method of contraception.</p>
<p>There is no conclusive evidence that oral contraceptive use is associated with an increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span>, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Previously, a few studies had reported that oral contraceptives might be associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span>, but these findings have not been seen in more recent studies. Nevertheless, oral contraceptives should not be used during pregnancy. You should check with your healthcare professional about risks to your unborn child of any medication taken during pregnancy.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">2. While breastfeeding</span></p>
<p>If you are breastfeeding, consult your healthcare professional before starting oral contraceptives. Some of the drug will be passed on to the child in the milk. A few adverse effects on the child have been reported, including yellowing of the skin (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span>) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="78474" conceptname="Hypertrophy of breast">breast enlargement</span>. In addition, combined oral contraceptives may decrease the amount and quality of your milk. If possible, do not use combined oral contraceptives while breastfeeding. You should use another method of contraception since breastfeeding provides only partial protection from becoming pregnant and this partial protection decreases significantly as you breastfeed for longer periods of time. You should consider starting combined oral contraceptives only after you have weaned your child completely.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">3. Laboratory tests</span></p>

<p><span class="Bold">PREGNANCY DUE TO PILL FAILURE</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Combined Oral Contraceptives</span></p>
<p>The incidence of pill failure resulting in pregnancy is approximately one percent (i.e., one pregnancy per 100 women per year) if taken every day as directed, but more typical failure rates are 5%. If failure does occur, the risk to the fetus is minimal.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">PREGNANCY AFTER STOPPING THE PILL</span></p>
<p>There may be some delay in becoming pregnant after you stop using oral contraceptives, especially if you had <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196168" conceptname="Irregular periods">irregular menstrual cycles</span> before you used oral contraceptives. It may be advisable to postpone conception until you begin menstruating regularly once you have stopped taking the pill and desire pregnancy. </p>
<p>There does not appear to be any increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span> in newborn babies when pregnancy occurs soon after stopping the pill.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span></p>
<p>Serious ill effects have not been reported following ingestion of large doses of oral contraceptives by young children. Overdosage may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4161407" conceptname="Withdrawal bleeding">withdrawal bleeding</span> in females. In case of overdosage, contact your healthcare professional or pharmacist.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">OTHER INFORMATION</span></p>
<p>Your healthcare professional will take a medical and family history before prescribing oral contraceptives and will examine you. The physical examination may be delayed to another time if you request it and the healthcare professional believes that it is a good medical practice to postpone it. You should be reexamined at least once a year. Be sure to inform your healthcare professional if there is a family history of any of the conditions listed previously in this leaflet. Be sure to keep all appointments with your healthcare professional, because this is a time to determine if there are early signs of side effects of oral contraceptive use.</p>
<p>Do not use the drug for any condition other than the one for which it was prescribed. This drug has been prescribed specifically for you; do not give it to others who may want birth control pills.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">HEALTH BENEFITS FROM ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES</span></p>
<p>In addition to preventing pregnancy, use of combined oral contraceptives may provide certain benefits. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>menstrual cycles may become more regular</li>
<li>blood flow during menstruation may be lighter and less iron may be lost. <br> Therefore, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span> due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4146209" conceptname="Iron deficiency">iron deficiency</span> is less likely to occur.</li>
<li><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> or other symptoms during menstruation may be encountered less frequently</li>
<li>ectopic (tubal) pregnancy may occur less frequently</li>
<li>noncancerous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4209224" conceptname="Cyst">cysts</span> or lumps in the breast may occur less frequently</li>
<li>acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="199067" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of female pelvic organs AND/OR tissues">pelvic inflammatory disease</span> may occur less frequently</li>
<li>oral contraceptive use may provide some protection against developing two forms of cancer: cancer of the ovaries and cancer of the lining of the uterus.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want more information about birth control pills, ask your healthcare professional or pharmacist. They have a more technical leaflet called the Professional Labeling, which you may wish to read. The professional labeling is also published in a book entitled <span class="Italics">Physicians' Desk Reference</span>, available in many book stores and public libraries.</p>
