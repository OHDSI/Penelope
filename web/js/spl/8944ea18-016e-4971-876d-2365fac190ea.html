<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">SUBLIMAZE (fentanyl citrate) is a narcotic analgesic. A dose of 100 mcg (0.1 mg) (2.0 ml) is approximately equivalent in analgesic activity to 10 mg of morphine or 75 mg of meperidine. The principal actions of therapeutic value are <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> and sedation. Alterations in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4313591" conceptname="Respiratory rate">respiratory rate</span> and alveolar ventilation, associated with narcotic analgesics, may last longer than the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span>. As the dose of narcotic is increased, the decrease in pulmonary exchange becomes greater. Large doses may produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span>. SUBLIMAZE appears to have less emetic activity than either morphine or meperidine. Histamine assays and skin wheal testing in man indicate that clinically significant histamine release rarely occurs with SUBLIMAZE. Recent assays in man show no clinically significant histamine release in dosages up to 50 mcg/kg (0.05 mg/kg) (1 ml/kg). SUBLIMAZE preserves cardiac stability, and blunts stress-related hormonal changes at higher doses.</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of SUBLIMAZE can be described as a three-compartment model, with a distribution time of 1.7 minutes, redistribution of 13 minutes and a terminal elimination half-life of 219 minutes. The volume of distribution for SUBLIMAZE is 4 L/kg. </p>
<p>SUBLIMAZE plasma protein binding capacity decreases with increasing ionization of the drug. Alterations in pH may affect its distribution between plasma and the central nervous system. It accumulates in skeletal muscle and fat, and is released slowly into the blood. SUBLIMAZE, which is primarily transformed in the liver, demonstrates a high first pass clearance and releases approximately 75% of an intravenous dose in urine, mostly as metabolites with less than 10% representing the unchanged drug. Approximately 9% of the dose is recovered in the feces, primarily as metabolites.</p>
<p>The onset of action of SUBLIMAZE is almost immediate when the drug is given intravenously; however, the maximal analgesic and respiratory depressant effect may not be noted for several minutes. The usual duration of action of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span> is 30 to 60 minutes after a single intravenous dose of up to 100 mcg (0.1 mg) (2.0 ml). Following intramuscular administration, the onset of action is from seven to eight minutes, and the duration of action is one to two hours. As with longer acting narcotic analgesics, the duration of the respiratory depressant effect of SUBLIMAZE may be longer than the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span>. The following observations have been reported concerning altered respiratory response to CO<span class="Sub">2</span> stimulation following administration of SUBLIMAZE to man.</p>

(Altered sensitivity to CO<span class="Sub">2</span> stimulation has been demonstrated for up to four hours following a single dose of 600 mcg (0.6 mg) (12 ml) SUBLIMAZE to healthy volunteers.) SUBLIMAZE frequently slows the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4313591" conceptname="Respiratory rate">respiratory rate</span>, duration and degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> being dose related.</li>
<li>The peak respiratory depressant effect of a single intravenous dose of SUBLIMAZE is noted 5 to 15 minutes following injection.

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34071-1">
<a name="Warnings"></a><a name="section-7"></a><p></p>
<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First">SUBLIMAZE (fentanyl citrate) SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED ONLY BY PERSONS SPECIFICALLY TRAINED IN THE USE OF INTRAVENOUS ANESTHETICS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE RESPIRATORY EFFECTS OF POTENT OPIOIDS.</p>
<p>AN OPIOID ANTAGONIST, RESUSCITATIVE AND INTUBATION EQUIPMENT AND OXYGEN SHOULD BE READILY AVAILABLE.</p>
<p>See also discussion of narcotic antagonists in <a href="#Precautions">PRECAUTIONS</a> and <a href="#Overdosage">OVERDOSAGE</a>.</p>
<p>If SUBLIMAZE is administered with a tranquilizer, the user should become familiar with the special properties of each drug, particularly the widely differing duration of action. In addition, when such a combination is used, fluids and other countermeasures to manage <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> should be available. </p>
<p>As with other potent narcotics, the respiratory depressant effect of SUBLIMAZE may persist longer than the measured <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span>. The total dose of all narcotic analgesics administered should be considered by the practitioner before ordering narcotic analgesics during recovery from anesthesia. It is recommended that narcotics, when required, should be used in reduced doses initially, as low as ¼ to ⅓ those usually recommended.</p>
<p>SUBLIMAZE may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4050941" conceptname="Muscle rigidity">muscle rigidity</span>, particularly involving the muscles of respiration. This <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4050941" conceptname="Muscle rigidity">rigidity</span> has been reported to occur or recur infrequently in the extended postoperative period usually following high dose administration. In addition, skeletal muscle movements of various groups in the extremities, neck and external eye have been reported during induction of anesthesia with fentanyl; these reported movements have, on rare occasions, been strong enough to pose patient management problems. This effect is related to the dose and speed of injection and its incidence can be reduced by: 1) administration of up to ¼ of the full paralyzing dose of a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent just prior to administration of SUBLIMAZE; 2) administration of a full paralyzing dose of a neuromuscular blocking agent following loss of eyelash reflex when SUBLIMAZE is used in anesthetic doses titrated by slow intravenous infusion; or, 3) simultaneous administration of SUBLIMAZE and a full paralyzing dose of a neuromuscular blocking agent when SUBLIMAZE is used in rapidly administered anesthetic dosages. The neuromuscular blocking agent used should be compatible with the patient's cardiovascular status. </p>
<p>Adequate facilities should be available for postoperative monitoring and ventilation of patients administered anesthetic doses of SUBLIMAZE. Where moderate or high doses are used (above 10 mcg/kg), there must be adequate facilities for postoperative observation, and ventilation if necessary, of patients who have received SUBLIMAZE. It is essential that these facilities be fully equipped to handle all degrees of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>. </p>
<p>SUBLIMAZE may also produce other signs and symptoms characteristic of narcotic analgesics including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142453" conceptname="Feeling high">euphoria</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435279" conceptname="Tonic pupillary reaction">miosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256717" conceptname="Bronchospasm">bronchoconstriction</span>. </p>
<p>Severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported for other narcotic analgesics. Although this has not been reported for fentanyl, there are insufficient data to establish that this does not occur with fentanyl. Therefore, when fentanyl is administered to patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, appropriate monitoring and ready availability of vasodilators and beta-blockers for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> is indicated. </p>

<h2>Head Injuries and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154803" conceptname="Raised intracranial pressure">Increased Intracranial Pressure</span></h2>
<p class="First">SUBLIMAZE should be used with caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">comatose</span> patients who may have a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375415" conceptname="Injury of head">head injury</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4116092" conceptname="Intracranial tumor">brain tumor</span>.

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34072-9">
<a name="section-8.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">The initial dose of SUBLIMAZE (fentanyl citrate) should be appropriately reduced in elderly and debilitated patients. The effect of the initial dose should be considered in determining incremental doses. </p>
<p>Nitrous oxide has been reported to produce cardiovascular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> when given with higher doses of SUBLIMAZE. </p>
<p>Certain forms of conduction anesthesia, such as spinal anesthesia and some peridural anesthetics, can alter respiration by blocking intercostal nerves. Through other mechanisms (see <a href="#CP">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>) SUBLIMAZE can also alter respiration. Therefore, when SUBLIMAZE is used to supplement these forms of anesthesia, the anesthetist should be familiar with the physiological alterations involved, and be prepared to manage them in the patients selected for these forms of anesthesia. </p>
<p>When a tranquilizer is used with SUBLIMAZE, pulmonary arterial pressure may be decreased. This fact should be considered by those who conduct diagnostic and surgical procedures where interpretation of pulmonary arterial pressure measurements might determine final management of the patient. When high dose or anesthetic dosages of SUBLIMAZE are employed, even relatively small dosages of diazepam may cause cardiovascular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>. </p>
<p>When SUBLIMAZE is used with a tranquilizer, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> can occur. If it occurs, the possibility of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436375" conceptname="Hypovolemia">hypovolemia</span> should also be considered and managed with appropriate parenteral fluid therapy. Repositioning the patient to improve venous return to the heart should be considered when operative conditions permit. Care should be exercised in moving and repositioning of patients because of the possibility of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span>. If volume expansion with fluids plus other countermeasures do not correct <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, the administration of pressor agents other than epinephrine should be considered. Epinephrine may paradoxically decrease blood pressure in patients treated with a neuroleptic that blocks alpha adrenergic activity.</p>
<p>Elevated blood pressure, with and without pre-existing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, has been reported following administration of SUBLIMAZE combined with a neuroleptic.  This might be due to unexplained alterations in sympathetic activity following large doses; however, it is also frequently attributed to anesthetic and surgical stimulation during <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4086497" conceptname="Light anesthesia">light anesthesia</span>.</p>
<p>When SUBLIMAZE is used with a neuroleptic and the EEG is used for postoperative monitoring, it may be found that the EEG pattern returns to normal slowly.</p>
<p>Many neuroleptic agents have been associated with QT prolongation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135823" conceptname="Torsades de pointes">torsades de pointes</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span>.

<p>ECG monitoring is indicated when a neuroleptic agent is used in conjunction with SUBLIMAZE as an anesthetic premedication, for the induction of anesthesia, or as an adjunct in the maintenance of general or regional anesthesia.</p>
<p>Vital signs should be monitored routinely. </p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">Respiratory depression</span> caused by opioid analgesics can be reversed by opioid antagonists such as naloxone. Because the duration of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> produced by SUBLIMAZE may last longer than the duration of the opioid antagonist action, appropriate surveillance should be maintained. As with all potent opioids, profound <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> is accompanied by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> and diminished sensitivity to CO<span class="Sub">2</span> stimulation which may persist into or recur in the postoperative period. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">Respiratory depression</span> secondary to chest wall <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4050941" conceptname="Muscle rigidity">rigidity</span> has been reported in the postoperative period. Intraoperative <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316814" conceptname="Hyperventilation">hyperventilation</span> may further alter postoperative response to CO<span class="Sub">2</span>.

<a name="section-11.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Manifestations</h2>
<p class="First">The manifestations of SUBLIMAZE (fentanyl citrate) overdosage are an extension of its pharmacologic actions (see <a href="#CP">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>) as with other opioid analgesics. The intravenous LD<span class="Sub">50</span> of SUBLIMAZE is 3 mg/kg in rats, 1 mg/kg in cats, 14 mg/kg in dogs and 0.03 mg/kg in monkeys. </p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">50 mcg = 0.05 mg = 1 ml</p>
<p>Dosage should be individualized. Some of the factors to be considered in determining the dose are age, body weight, physical status, underlying pathological condition, use of other drugs, type of anesthesia to be used and the surgical procedure involved. Dosage should be reduced in elderly or debilitated patients (see <a href="#Precautions">PRECAUTIONS</a>). </p>
<p>Vital signs should be monitored routinely.</p>
<dl>
<dt>I.</dt>
<dd>Premedication — Premedication (to be appropriately modified in the elderly, debilitated and those who have received other depressant drugs) — 50 to 100 mcg (0.05 to 0.1 mg) (1 to 2 ml) may be administered intramuscularly 30 to 60 minutes prior to surgery.</dd>
<dt>II.</dt>
<dd>Adjunct to General Anesthesia — See <a href="#dosagechart">Dosage Range Chart</a>
</dd>
<dt>III.</dt>
<dd>Adjunct to Regional Anesthesia - 50 to 100 mcg (0.05 to 0.1 mg) (1 to 2 ml) may be administered intramuscularly or slowly intravenously, over one to two minutes, when additional <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> is required.</dd>
<dt>IV.</dt>
<dd>Postoperatively (recovery room) - 50 to 100 mcg (0.05 to 0.1 mg) (1 to 2 ml) may be administered intramuscularly for the control of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317376" conceptname="Tachypnea">tachypnea</span> and emergence <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373995" conceptname="Delirium">delirium</span>.

<span class="Bold">Moderate Dose</span> — 2 to 20 mcg/kg (0.002 to 0.02 mg/kg) (0.04 to 0.4 ml/kg) SUBLIMAZE. Where surgery becomes more major, a larger dose is required. With this dose, in addition to adequate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, one would expect to see some abolition of the stress response. However, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> will be such that artificial ventilation during anesthesia is necessary and careful observation of ventilation postoperatively is essential.</td>

<span class="Bold">High Dose</span> — 20 to 50 mcg/kg (0.02 to 0.05 mg/kg) (0.4 to 1 ml/kg) SUBLIMAZE. During open heart surgery and certain more complicated neurosurgical and orthopedic procedures where surgery is more prolonged, and in the opinion of the anesthesiologist, the stress response to surgery would be detrimental to the well being of the patient, dosages of 20 to 50 mcg/kg (0.02 to 0.05 mg) (0.4 to 1 ml) of SUBLIMAZE with nitrous oxide/oxygen have been shown to attenuate the stress response as defined by increased levels of circulating growth hormone, catecholamine, ADH and prolactin. When dosages in this range have been used during surgery, postoperative ventilation and observation are essential due to extended postoperative <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>.

<h2>As a General Anesthetic </h2>
<p class="First">When attenuation of the responses to surgical stress is especially important, doses of 50 to 100 mcg/kg (0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg) (1 to 2 ml/kg) may be administered with oxygen and a muscle relaxant. This technique has been reported to provide anesthesia without the use of additional anesthetic agents. In certain cases, doses up to 150 mcg/kg (0.15 mg/kg) (3 ml/kg) may be necessary to produce this anesthetic effect. It has been used for open heart surgery and certain other major surgical procedures in patients for whom protection of the myocardium from excess oxygen demand is particularly indicated, and for certain complicated neurological and orthopedic procedures. </p>
<p>As noted above, it is essential that qualified personnel and adequate facilities be available for the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>. </p>
<p>See <a href="#Warnings">WARNINGS</a> and <a href="#Precautions">PRECAUTIONS</a> for use of SUBLIMAZE (fentanyl citrate) with other CNS depressants, and in patients with altered response. </p>
<p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. </p>
