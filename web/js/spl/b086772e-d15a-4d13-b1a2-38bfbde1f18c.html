<h1>DESCRIPTION:
</h1>
<p class="First">Buprenex (buprenorphine hydrochloride) is a narcotic under the Controlled Substances Act due to its chemical derivation from thebaine. Chemically, it is 17-(cyclopropylmethyl)-α-(1, 1-dimethylethyl)-4, 5-epoxy-18, 19-dihydro-3-hydroxy-6-methoxy-α-methyl-6, 14-ethenomorphinan-7-methanol, hydrochloride [5α, 7α(S)]. Buprenorphine hydrochloride is a white powder, weakly acidic and with limited solubility in water. Buprenex is a clear, sterile, injectable agonist-antagonist analgesic intended for intravenous or intramuscular administration. Each ml of Buprenex contains 0.324 mg buprenorphine hydrochloride (equivalent to 0.3 mg buprenorphine), 50 mg anhydrous dextrose, water for injection and HCI to adjust pH. Buprenorphine hydrochloride has the molecular formula, C<span class="Sub">29</span>H<span class="Sub">41</span>NO<span class="Sub">4</span>HCl, and the following structure:

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:
</h1>
<p class="First">Buprenex is a parenteral opioid analgesic with 0.3mg Buprenex being approximately equivalent to 10 mg morphine sulfate in analgesic and respiratory depressant effects in adults. Pharmacological effects occur as soon as 15 minutes after intramuscular injection and persist for 6 hours or longer. Peak pharmacologic effects usually are observed at 1 hour. When used intravenously, the times to onset and peak effect are shortened.
</p>
<p>The limits of sensitivity of available analytical methodology precluded demonstration of bioequivalence between intramuscular and intravenous routes of administration. In postoperative adults, pharmacokinetic studies have shown elimination half-lives ranging from 1.2-7.2 hours (mean 2.2 hours) after intravenous administration of 0.3mg of buprenorphine. A single, ten-patient, pharmacokinetic study of doses of 3μg/kg in children (age 5-7 years) showed a high inter-patient variability, but suggests that the clearance of the drug may be higher in children than in adults. This is supported by at least one repeat-dose study in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439502" conceptname="Postoperative pain">postoperative pain</span> that showed an optimal inter-dose interval of 4-5 hours in pediatric patients as opposed to the recommended 6-8 hours in adults.
</p>
<p>Buprenorphine, in common with morphine and other phenolic opioid analgesics, is metabolized by the liver and its clearance is related to hepatic blood flow. Studies in patients anesthetized with 0.5% halothane have shown that this anesthetic decreases hepatic blood flow by about 30%.

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Analgesic Action:</span> Buprenex exerts its <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span> via high affinity binding to μ subclass opiate receptors in the central nervous system. Although Buprenex may be classified as a partial agonist, under the conditions of recommended use it behaves very much like classical μ agonists such as morphine. One unusual property of Buprenex observed in <span class="Italics">vitro</span> studies is its very slow rate of dissociation from its receptor. This could account for its longer duration of action than morphine, the unpredictability of its reversal by opioid antagonists, and its low level of manifest physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>.

<a name="s17"></a><a name="section-7.1"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">General:</span> Buprenex should be administered with caution in the elderly, debilitated patients, in children and those with severe impairment of hepatic, pulmonary, or renal function; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4182596" conceptname="Myxedema">myxedema</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140673" conceptname="Hypothyroidism">hypothyroidism</span>; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="193984" conceptname="Adrenal hypofunction">adrenal cortical insufficiency</span> (e.g., Addison's disease); <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>; toxic psychoses; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198803" conceptname="Benign prostatic hyperplasia">prostatic hypertrophy</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="195590" conceptname="Urethral stricture">urethral stricture</span>; acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218106" conceptname="Alcoholism">alcoholism</span>; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377830" conceptname="Alcohol withdrawal delirium">delirium tremens</span>; or kyphoscoliosis.
</p>
<p>Because Buprenex is metabolized by the liver, the activity of Buprenex may be increased and/or extended in those individuals with impaired hepatic function or those receiving other agents known to decrease hepatic clearance.
</p>
<p>Buprenex has been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure to a similar degree as other opioid analgesics, and thus should be administered with caution to patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract.
</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34076-0">
<a name="s18"></a><a name="section-7.2"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Information for Patients:</span> The effects of Buprenex, particularly <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, may be potentiated by other centrally acting agents such as alcohol or benzodiazepines. It is particularly important that in these circumstances patients must not drive or operate machinery. Buprenex has some pharmacologic effects similar to morphine which in susceptible patients may lead to self-administration of the drug when <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> no longer exists. Patients must not exceed the dosage of Buprenex prescribed by their physician. Patients should be urged to consult their physician if other prescription medications are currently being used or are prescribed for future use.
</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions:</span> Drug interactions common to other potent opioid analgesics also may occur with Buprenex. Particular care should be taken when Buprenex is used in combination with central nervous system depressant drugs (see <a href="#s10">WARNINGS</a>). Although specific information is not presently available, caution should be exercised when Buprenex is used in combination with MAO inhibitors. There have been reports of respiratory and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443240" conceptname="Collapse">cardiovascular collapse</span> in patients who received therapeutic doses of diazepam and Buprenex. A suspected interaction between Buprenex and phenprocoumon resulting in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047773" conceptname="Purpura">purpura</span> has been reported.
</p>
<p>CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Since the metabolism of buprenorphine is mediated by the CYP3A4 isozyme, coadministration of drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of buprenorphine. Thus patients coadministered with inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritanovir) while receiving Buprenex should be carefully monitored and dosage adjustment made if warranted.
</p>
<p>CYP3A4 Inducers: Cytochrome P450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, induce metabolism and as such may cause increased clearance of buprenorphine. Caution is advised when administering Buprenex to patients receiving these medications and if necessary dose adjustments should be considered

<p>In the United Kingdom, buprenorphine hydrochloride was made available under monitored release regulation during the first year of sale, and yielded data from 1,736 physicians on 9,123 patients (17,120 administrations). Data on 240 children under the age of 18 years were included in this monitored release program. No important new adverse effects attributable to buprenorphine hydrochloride were observed.

<h1>DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span>:
</h1>
<p class="First">Buprenorphine hydrochloride is a partial agonist of the morphine type; i.e., it has certain opioid properties which may lead to psychic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> of the morphine type due to an opiate-like euphoric component of the drug. Direct <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> studies have shown little physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> upon withdrawal of the drug. However, caution should be used in prescribing to individuals who are known to be drug abusers or ex-narcotic addicts. The drug may not substitute in acutely dependent narcotic addicts due to its antagonist component and may induce withdrawal symptoms.

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:
</h1>
<p class="First">Adults: The usual dosage for persons 13 years of age and over is 1 ml Buprenex (0.3 mg buprenorphine) given by deep intramuscular or slow (over at least 2 minutes) intravenous injection at up to 6-hour intervals, as needed. Repeat once (up to 0.3 mg) if required, 30 to 60 minutes after initial dosage, giving consideration to previous dose pharmacokinetics, and thereafter only as needed. In high-risk patients (e.g., elderly, debilitated, presence of respiratory disease, etc.) and/or in patients where other CNS depressants are present, such as in the immediate postoperative period, the dose should be reduced by approximately one-half. Extra caution should be exercised with the intravenous route of administration, particularly with the initial dose. Occasionally, it may be necessary to administer single doses of up to 0.6 mg to adults depending on the severity of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> and the response of the patient. This dose should only be given I.M. and only to adult patients who are not in a high risk category (see <a href="#s10">WARNINGS</a> and <a href="#s16">PRECAUTIONS</a>). At this time, there are insufficient data to recommend single doses greater than 0.6 mg for long-term use.
</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s34"></a><a name="section-11.1"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Children:</span> Buprenex has been used in children 2-12 years of age at doses between 2-6 micrograms/kg of body weight given every 4-6 hours. There is insufficient experience to recommend a dose in infants below the age of two years, single doses greater than 6 micrograms/kg of body weight, or the use of a repeat or second dose at 30-60 minutes (such as is used in adults). Since there is some evidence that not all children clear buprenorphine faster than adults, fixed interval or "round-the-clock" dosing should not be undertaken until the proper inter-dose interval has been established by clinical observation of the child. Physicians should recognize that, as with adults, some pediatric patients may not need to be remedicated for 6-8 hours.

<p>Buprenex is a potent narcotic, and like all drugs of this class has been associated with abuse and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> among health care providers. To control the risk of diversion, it is recommended that measures appropriate to the health care setting be taken to provide rigid accounting, control of wastage, and restriction of access.
