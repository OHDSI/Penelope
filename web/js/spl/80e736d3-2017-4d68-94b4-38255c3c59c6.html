<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Penicillamine is a chelating agent recommended for the removal of excess copper in patients with Wilson's disease. From <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies which indicate that one atom of copper combines with two molecules of penicillamine, it would appear that one gram of penicillamine should be followed by the excretion of about 200 milligrams of copper; however, the actual amount excreted is about one percent of this. </p>
<p>Penicillamine also reduces excess cystine excretion in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4225406" conceptname="Cystinuria">cystinuria</span>. This is done, at least in part, by disulfide interchange between penicillamine and cystine, resulting in formation of penicillamine-cysteine disulfide, a substance that is much more soluble than cystine and is excreted readily. </p>
<p>Penicillamine interferes with the formation of cross-links between tropocollagen molecules and cleaves them when newly formed. </p>
<p>The mechanism of action of penicillamine in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> is unknown although it appears to suppress disease activity. Unlike cytotoxic immunosuppressants, penicillamine markedly lowers IgM rheumatoid factor but produces no significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> in absolute levels of serum immunoglobulins. Also unlike cytotoxic immunosuppressants which act on both, penicillamine <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> depresses T-cell activity but not B-cell activity. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span>, penicillamine dissociates macroglobulins (rheumatoid factor) although the relationship of the activity to its effect in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> is not known. </p>
<p>In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span>, the onset of therapeutic response to CUPRIMINE may not be seen for two or three months. In those patients who respond, however, the first evidence of suppression of symptoms such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4082445" conceptname="Tenderness">tenderness</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span> is generally apparent within three months. The optimum duration of therapy has not been determined. If remissions occur, they may last from months to years, but usually require continued treatment (see <a href="#DA">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>). </p>
<p>In all patients receiving penicillamine, it is important that CUPRIMINE be given on an empty stomach, at least one hour before meals or two hours after meals, and at least one hour apart from any other drug, food, milk, antacid, zinc or iron-containing preparation. This permits maximum absorption and reduces the likelihood of inactivation by metal binding in the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="43682-4">
<a name="section-2.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Penicillamine is absorbed rapidly but incompletely (40-70%) from the gastrointestinal tract, with wide interindividual variations. Food, antacids, and iron reduce absorption of the drug. The peak plasma concentration of penicillamine occurs 1-3 hours after ingestion; it is approximately 1-2 mg/L after an oral dose of 250 mg. The drug appears in the plasma as free penicillamine, penicillamine disulfide, and cysteine-penicillamine disulfide. When prolonged treatment is stopped, there is a slow elimination phase lasting 4-6 days. </p>
<p>More than 80% of plasma penicillamine is bound to proteins, especially albumin and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4294533" conceptname="Ferroxidase">ceruloplasmin</span>. The drug also binds to erythrocytes and macrophages. A small fraction of the dose is metabolized in the liver to S-methyl-D-penicillamine. Excretion is mainly renal, mainly as disulfides. </p>

<h2>Wilson's Disease</h2>
<p class="First">Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) occurs in individuals who have inherited an autosomal recessive defect that leads to an accumulation of copper far in excess of metabolic requirements. The excess copper is deposited in several organs and tissues, and eventually produces pathological effects primarily in the liver, where damage progresses to postnecrotic cirrhosis, and in the brain, where degeneration is widespread. Copper is also deposited as characteristic, asymptomatic, golden-brown Kayser-Fleischer rings in the corneas of all patients with cerebral symptomatology and some patients who are either asymptomatic or manifest only hepatic symptomatology. </p>
<p>Two types of patients require treatment for Wilson's disease: (1) the symptomatic, and (2) the asymptomatic in whom it can be assumed the disease will develop in the future if the patient is not treated. </p>
<p>The diagnosis, if suspected on the basis of family or individual history or physical examination, can be confirmed if the plasma copper-protein <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4294533" conceptname="Ferroxidase">ceruloplasmin</span><a name="footnote-reference-2" href="#footnote-2" class="Sup">2</a> is &lt;20 mg/dL and either a quantitative determination in a liver biopsy specimen shows an abnormally high concentration of copper (&gt;250 mcg/g dry weight) or Kayser-Fleischer rings are present. </p>
<p>Treatment has two objectives: </p>
<dl>
<dt>(1)</dt>
<dd>to minimize dietary intake of copper;</dd>
<dt>(2)</dt>
<dd>to promote excretion and complex formation (i.e., detoxification) of excess tissue copper.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The first objective is attained by a daily diet that contains no more than one or two milligrams of copper. Such a diet should exclude, most importantly, chocolate, nuts, shellfish, mushrooms, liver, molasses, broccoli, and cereals and dietary supplements enriched with copper, and be composed to as great an extent as possible of foods with a low copper content. Distilled or demineralized water should be used if the patient's drinking water contains more than 0.1 mg of copper per liter. </p>
<p>For the second objective, a copper chelating agent is used. </p>
<p>In symptomatic patients this treatment usually produces marked neurologic improvement, fading of Kayser-Fleischer rings, and gradual amelioration of hepatic dysfunction and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432586" conceptname="Mental disorder">psychic disturbances</span>. </p>
<p>Clinical experience to date suggests that life is prolonged with the above regimen. </p>
<p>Noticeable improvement may not occur for one to three months. Occasionally, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4204047" conceptname="Neurological symptom">neurologic symptoms</span> become worse during initiation of therapy with CUPRIMINE. Despite this, the drug should not be withdrawn. Temporary interruption carries an increased risk of developing a sensitivity reaction upon resumption of therapy, although it may result in clinical improvement of neurological symptoms (see <a href="#Warnings">WARNINGS</a>). If the neurological symptoms and signs continue to worsen for a month after the initiation of CUPRIMINE therapy, several short courses of treatment with 2,3 - dimercaprol (BAL) while continuing CUPRIMINE may be considered. </p>
<p>Treatment of asymptomatic patients has been carried out for over thirty years. Symptoms and signs of the disease appear to be prevented indefinitely if daily treatment with CUPRIMINE is continued. </p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4225406" conceptname="Cystinuria">Cystinuria</span></h2>
<p class="First"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4225406" conceptname="Cystinuria">Cystinuria</span> is characterized by excessive urinary excretion of the dibasic amino acids, arginine, lysine, ornithine, and cystine, and the mixed disulfide of cysteine and homocysteine. The metabolic defect that leads to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4225406" conceptname="Cystinuria">cystinuria</span> is inherited as an autosomal, recessive trait. Metabolism of the affected amino acids is influenced by at least two abnormal factors: (1) defective gastrointestinal absorption and (2) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4318544" conceptname="Renal tubular disorder">renal tubular dysfunction</span>. </p>
<p>Arginine, lysine, ornithine, and cysteine are soluble substances, readily excreted. There is no apparent pathology connected with their excretion in excessive quantities. </p>
<p>Cystine, however, is so slightly soluble at the usual range of urinary pH that it is not excreted readily, and so crystallizes and forms stones in the urinary tract. Stone formation is the only known pathology in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4225406" conceptname="Cystinuria">cystinuria</span>. </p>
<p>Normal daily output of cystine is 40 to 80 mg. In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4225406" conceptname="Cystinuria">cystinuria</span>, output is greatly increased and may exceed 1 g/day. At 500 to 600 mg/day, stone formation is almost certain. When it is more than 300 mg/day, treatment is indicated.</p>
<p>Conventional treatment is directed at keeping urinary cystine diluted enough to prevent stone formation, keeping the urine alkaline enough to dissolve as much cystine as possible, and minimizing cystine production by a diet low in methionine (the major dietary precursor of cystine). Patients must drink enough fluid to keep urine specific gravity below 1.010, take enough alkali to keep urinary pH at 7.5 to 8, and maintain a diet low in methionine. This diet is not recommended in growing children and probably is contraindicated in pregnancy because of its low protein content (see <a href="#Precautions">PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>
<p>When these measures are inadequate to control recurrent stone formation, CUPRIMINE may be used as additional therapy, and when patients refuse to adhere to conventional treatment, CUPRIMINE may be a useful substitute. It is capable of keeping cystine excretion to near normal values, thereby hindering stone formation and the serious consequences of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198199" conceptname="Pyelonephritis">pyelonephritis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> that develop in some patients. Bartter and colleagues depict the process by which penicillamine interacts with cystine to form penicillamine-cysteine mixed disulfide as:</p>

<p>Most of the various forms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135338" conceptname="Pemphigus">pemphigus</span> have occurred during treatment with penicillamine. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135338" conceptname="Pemphigus">Pemphigus vulgaris</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135338" conceptname="Pemphigus">pemphigus foliaceus</span> are reported most frequently, usually as a late complication of therapy.

<h2>Pregnancy Category D</h2>
<p class="First">Penicillamine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Penicillamine has been shown to be teratogenic in rats when given in doses 6 times higher than the highest dose recommended for human use. Skeletal defects, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135923" conceptname="Cleft palate">cleft palates</span> and fetal toxicity (resorptions) have been reported. </p>

Penicillamine should be used in women of childbearing potential only when the expected benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Women on therapy with penicillamine who are of childbearing potential should be apprised of this risk, advised to report promptly any missed menstrual periods or other indications of possible pregnancy, and followed closely for early recognition of pregnancy. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. </p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Some patients may experience <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">drug fever</span>, a marked febrile response to penicillamine, usually in the second to third week following initiation of therapy. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">Drug fever</span> may sometimes be accompanied by a macular cutaneous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">eruption</span>. In the case of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">drug fever</span> in patients with Wilson's disease or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4225406" conceptname="Cystinuria">cystinuria</span>, penicillamine should be temporarily discontinued until the reaction subsides. Then penicillamine should be reinstituted with a small dose that is gradually increased until the desired dosage is attained. Systemic steroid therapy may be necessary, and is usually helpful, in such patients in whom <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">drug fever</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> develop several times.</p>
<p>In the case of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">drug fever</span> in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> patients, because other treatments are available, penicillamine should be discontinued and another therapeutic alternative tried since experience indicates that the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">febrile reaction</span> will recur in a very high percentage of patients upon readministration of penicillamine.</p>
<p>The skin and mucous membranes should be observed for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergic reactions</span>. Early and late <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rashes</span> have occurred. Early <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> occurs during the first few months of treatment and is more common. It is usually a generalized pruritic, erythematous, maculopapular or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4083309" conceptname="Morbilliform eruption">morbilliform rash</span> and resembles the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4070025" conceptname="Cutaneous hypersensitivity">allergic rash</span> seen with other drugs. Early <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> usually disappears within days after stopping penicillamine and seldom recurs when the drug is restarted at a lower dosage. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">Pruritus</span> and early <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> may often be controlled by the concomitant administration of antihistamines. Less commonly, a late <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> may be seen, usually after six months or more of treatment, and requires discontinuation of penicillamine. It is usually on the trunk, is accompanied by intense <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span>, and is usually unresponsive to topical corticosteroid therapy. Late <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> may take weeks to disappear after penicillamine is stopped and usually recurs if the drug is restarted. </p>
<p>The appearance of a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4080559" conceptname="Baboon syndrome">drug eruption</span> accompanied by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77074" conceptname="Joint pain">arthralgia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315085" conceptname="Lymphadenopathy">lymphadenopathy</span> or other allergic manifestations usually requires discontinuation of penicillamine.</p>
<p>Certain patients will develop a positive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4163958" conceptname="Antinuclear antibody">antinuclear antibody</span> (ANA) test and some of these may show a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255891" conceptname="Lupus erythematosus">lupus erythematosus</span>-like syndrome similar to drug-induced lupus associated with other drugs. The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255891" conceptname="Lupus erythematosus">lupus erythematosus</span>-like syndrome is not associated with hypocomplementemia and may be present without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">nephropathy</span>. The development of a positive ANA test does not mandate discontinuance of the drug; however, the physician should be alerted to the possibility that a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255891" conceptname="Lupus erythematosus">lupus erythematosus</span>-like syndrome may develop in the future.</p>
<p>Some patients may develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260546" conceptname="Ulcerative stomatitis">oral ulcerations</span> which in some cases have the appearance of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138463" conceptname="Aphthous ulcer of mouth">aphthous stomatitis</span>. The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138455" conceptname="Stomatitis">stomatitis</span> usually recurs on rechallenge but often clears on a lower dosage. Although rare, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4039954" conceptname="Cheilosis">cheilosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436147" conceptname="Glossitis">glossitis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138455" conceptname="Stomatitis">gingivostomatitis</span> have also been reported. These <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="43530620" conceptname="Oral lesion">oral lesions</span> are frequently dose-related and may preclude further increase in penicillamine dosage or require discontinuation of the drug.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44783805" conceptname="Hypogeusia">Hypogeusia</span> (a blunting or diminution in taste perception) has occurred in some patients. This may last two to three months or more and may develop into a total <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4289517" conceptname="Loss of taste">loss of taste</span>; however, it is usually self-limited despite continued penicillamine treatment. Such taste impairment is rare in patients with Wilson's disease.</p>
<p>Penicillamine should not be used in patients who are receiving concurrently gold therapy, antimalarial or cytotoxic drugs, oxyphenbutazone or phenylbutazone because these drugs are also associated with similar serious hematologic and renal adverse reactions.</p>
<p>Patients who have had gold salt therapy discontinued due to a major toxic reaction may be at greater risk of serious adverse reactions with penicillamine but not necessarily of the same type.</p>
<p>Patients who are allergic to penicillin may theoretically have cross-sensitivity to penicillamine. The possibility of reactions from contamination of penicillamine by trace amounts of penicillin has been eliminated now that penicillamine is being produced synthetically rather than as a degradation product of penicillin.</p>
<p>Patients with Wilson's disease or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4225406" conceptname="Cystinuria">cystinuria</span> should be given 25 mg/day of pyridoxine during therapy, since penicillamine increases the requirement for this vitamin. Patients also may receive benefit from a multivitamin preparation, although there is no evidence that deficiency of any vitamin other than pyridoxine is associated with penicillamine. In Wilson's disease, multivitamin preparations must be copper-free.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">Rheumatoid arthritis</span> patients whose nutrition is impaired should also be given a daily supplement of pyridoxine. Mineral supplements should not be given, since they may block the response to penicillamine. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4146209" conceptname="Iron deficiency">Iron deficiency</span> may develop, especially in pediatric patients and in menstruating women. In Wilson's disease, this may be a result of adding the effects of the low copper diet, which is probably also low in iron, and the penicillamine to the effects of blood loss or growth. In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4225406" conceptname="Cystinuria">cystinuria</span>, a low methionine diet may contribute to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4146209" conceptname="Iron deficiency">iron deficiency</span>, since it is necessarily low in protein. If necessary, iron may be given in short courses, but a period of two hours should elapse between administration of penicillamine and iron, since orally administered iron has been shown to reduce the effects of penicillamine.</p>
<p>Penicillamine causes an increase in the amount of soluble collagen. In the rat this results in inhibition of normal healing and also a decrease in tensile strength of intact skin. In man this may be the cause of increased skin friability at sites especially subject to pressure or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433633" conceptname="Late effect of superficial injury">trauma</span>, such as shoulders, elbows, knees, toes, and buttocks. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4295895" conceptname="Extravasation">Extravasations</span> of blood may occur and may appear as purpuric areas, with external <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> if the skin is broken, or as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443720" conceptname="Blister">vesicles</span> containing dark blood. Neither type is progressive. There is no apparent association with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> elsewhere in the body and no associated coagulation defect has been found. Therapy with penicillamine may be continued in the presence of these lesions. They may not recur if dosage is reduced. Other reported effects probably due to the action of penicillamine on collagen are excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkling</span> of the skin and development of small, white <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4105835" conceptname="Papule">papules</span> at venipuncture and surgical sites.</p>
<p>The effects of penicillamine on collagen and elastin make it advisable to consider a reduction in dosage to 250 mg/day, when surgery is contemplated. Reinstitution of full therapy should be delayed until <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029919" conceptname="Wound">wound</span> healing is complete. </p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">In all patients receiving penicillamine, it is important that CUPRIMINE be given on an empty stomach, at least one hour before meals or two hours after meals, and at least one hour apart from any other drug, food, or milk. Because penicillamine increases the requirement for pyridoxine, patients may require a daily supplement of pyridoxine (see <a href="#Precautions">PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-8.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Wilson's Disease</h2>
<p class="First">Optimal dosage can be determined by measurement of urinary copper excretion and the determination of free copper in the serum. The urine must be collected in copper-free glassware, and should be quantitatively analyzed for copper before and soon after initiation of therapy with CUPRIMINE.</p>
<p>Determination of 24-hour urinary copper excretion is of greatest value in the first week of therapy with penicillamine. In the absence of any drug reaction, a dose between 0.75 and 1.5 g that results in an initial 24-hour cupriuresis of over 2 mg should be continued for about three months, by which time the most reliable method of monitoring maintenance treatment is the determination of free copper in the serum. This equals the difference between quantitatively determined total copper and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4294533" conceptname="Ferroxidase">ceruloplasmin</span>-copper. Adequately treated patients will usually have less than 10 mcg free copper/dL of serum. It is seldom necessary to exceed a dosage of 2 g/day. If the patient is intolerant to therapy with CUPRIMINE, alternative treatment is trientine hydrochloride.</p>
<p>In patients who cannot tolerate as much as 1 g/day initially, initiating dosage with 250 mg/day, and increasing gradually to the requisite amount, gives closer control of the effects of the drug and may help to reduce the incidence of adverse reactions.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4225406" conceptname="Cystinuria">Cystinuria</span></h2>
<p class="First">It is recommended that CUPRIMINE be used along with conventional therapy. By reducing urinary cystine, it decreases <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4188213" conceptname="Crystalluria">crystalluria</span> and stone formation. In some instances, it has been reported to decrease the size of, and even to dissolve, stones already formed.</p>
<p>The usual dosage of CUPRIMINE in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4225406" conceptname="Cystinuria">cystinuria</span> is 2 g/day for adults, with a range of 1 to 4 g/day. For pediatric patients, dosage can be based on 30 mg/kg/day. The total daily amount should be divided into four doses. If four equal doses are not feasible, give the larger portion at bedtime. If adverse reactions necessitate a reduction in dosage, it is important to retain the bedtime dose.</p>
<p>Initiating dosage with 250 mg/day, and increasing gradually to the requisite amount, gives closer control of the effects of the drug and may help to reduce the incidence of adverse reactions.</p>
<p>In addition to taking CUPRIMINE, patients should drink copiously. It is especially important to drink about a pint of fluid at bedtime and another pint once during the night when urine is more concentrated and more acid than during the day. The greater the fluid intake, the lower the required dosage of CUPRIMINE.</p>
<p>Dosage must be individualized to an amount that limits cystine excretion to 100-200 mg/day in those with no history of stones, and below 100 mg/day in those who have had stone formation and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>. Thus, in determining dosage, the inherent tubular defect, the patient's size, age, and rate of growth, and his diet and water intake all must be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>The standard nitroprusside cyanide test has been reported useful as a qualitative measure of the effective dose:<a name="footnote-reference-4" href="#footnote-4" class="Sup">4</a> Add 2 mL of freshly prepared 5 percent sodium cyanide to 5 mL of a 24-hour aliquot of protein-free urine and let stand ten minutes. Add 5 drops of freshly prepared 5 percent sodium nitroprusside and mix. Cystine will turn the mixture magenta. If the result is negative, it can be assumed that cystine excretion is less than 100 mg/g creatinine.</p>
<p>Although penicillamine is rarely excreted unchanged, it also will turn the mixture magenta.If there is any question as to which substance is causing the reaction, a ferric chloride test can be done to eliminate doubt: Add 3 percent ferric chloride dropwise to the urine. Penicillamine will turn the urine an immediate and quickly fading blue. Cystine will not produce any change in appearance.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">Rheumatoid Arthritis</span></h2>
<p class="First">The principal rule of treatment with CUPRIMINE in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> is patience. The onset of therapeutic response is typically delayed. Two or three months may be required before the first evidence of a clinical response is noted (see <a href="#CP">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>).</p>
<p>When treatment with CUPRIMINE has been interrupted because of adverse reactions or other reasons, the drug should be reintroduced cautiously by starting with a lower dosage and increasing slowly.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-8.3.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Initial Therapy</h3>
<p class="First">The currently recommended dosage regimen in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> begins with a single daily dose of 125 mg or 250 mg, which is thereafter increased at one to three month intervals, by 125 mg or 250 mg/day, as patient response and tolerance indicate. If a satisfactory remission of symptoms is achieved, the dose associated with the remission should be continued (see <a href="#MT">Maintenance Therapy</a>). If there is no improvement and there are no signs of potentially serious toxicity after two to three months of treatment with doses of 500-750 mg/day, increases of 250 mg/day at two to three month intervals may be continued until a satisfactory remission occurs (see <a href="#MT">Maintenance Therapy</a>) or signs of toxicity develop (see <a href="#Warnings">WARNINGS</a> and <a href="#Precautions">PRECAUTIONS</a>). If there is no discernible improvement after three to four months of treatment with 1000 to 1500 mg of penicillamine/day, it may be assumed the patient will not respond and CUPRIMINE should be discontinued.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="MT"></a><a name="section-8.3.2"></a><p></p>
<h3>Maintenance Therapy</h3>
<p class="First">The maintenance dosage of CUPRIMINE must be individualized, and may require adjustment during the course of treatment. Many patients respond satisfactorily to a dosage within the 500-750 mg/day range. Some need less.</p>
<p>Changes in maintenance dosage levels may not be reflected clinically or in the erythrocyte  sedimentation rate for two to three months after each dosage adjustment.</p>
<p>Some patients will subsequently require an increase in the maintenance dosage to achieve maximal disease suppression. In those patients who do respond, but who evidence incomplete suppression of their disease after the first six to nine months of treatment, the daily dosage of CUPRIMINE may be increased by 125 mg or 250 mg/day at three-month intervals. It is unusual in current practice to employ a dosage in excess of 1 g/day, but up to 1.5 g/day has sometimes been required.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-8.3.3"></a><p></p>
<h3>Management of Exacerbations</h3>
<p class="First">During the course of treatment some patients may experience an exacerbation of disease activity following an initial good response. These may be self-limited and can subside within twelve weeks. They are usually controlled by the addition of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and only if the patient has demonstrated a true "escape" phenomenon (as evidenced by failure of the flare to subside within this time period) should an increase in the maintenance dose ordinarily be considered.</p>
<p>In the rheumatoid patient, migratory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77074" conceptname="Joint pain">polyarthralgia</span> due to penicillamine is extremely difficult to differentiate from an exacerbation of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span>. Discontinuance or a substantial reduction in dosage of CUPRIMINE for up to several weeks will usually determine which of these processes is responsible for the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77074" conceptname="Joint pain">arthralgia</span>.</p>

<h3>Duration of Therapy</h3>
<p class="First">The optimum duration of therapy with CUPRIMINE in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> has not been determined. If the patient has been in remission for six months or more, a gradual, stepwise dosage reduction in decrements of 125 mg or 250 mg/day at approximately three month intervals may be attempted.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-8.3.5"></a><p></p>
<h3>Concomitant Drug Therapy</h3>
<p class="First">CUPRIMINE should not be used in patients who are receiving gold therapy, antimalarial or cytotoxic drugs, oxyphenbutazone, or phenylbutazone (see <a href="#Precautions">PRECAUTIONS</a>). Other measures, such as salicylates, other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or systemic corticosteroids, may be continued when penicillamine is initiated. After improvement commences, analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs may be slowly discontinued as symptoms permit. Steroid withdrawal must be done gradually, and many months of treatment with CUPRIMINE may be required before steroids can be completely eliminated.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-8.3.6"></a><p></p>
<h3>Dosage Frequency</h3>
<p class="First">Based on clinical experience, dosages up to 500 mg/day can be given as a single daily dose. Dosages in excess of 500 mg/day should be administered in divided doses.</p>
