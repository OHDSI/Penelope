<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Amitriptyline hydrochloride is an antidepressant with sedative effects. Its mechanism of action in man is not known. It is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, and it does not act primarily by stimulation of the central nervous system.</p>
<p>Amitriptyline inhibits the membrane pump mechanism responsible for uptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in adrenergic and serotonergic neurons. Pharmacologically this action may potentiate or prolong neuronal activity since reuptake of these biogenic amines is important physiologically in terminating transmitting activity. This interference with the reuptake of norepinephrine and/or serotonin is believed by some to underlie the antidepressant activity of amitriptyline.</p>

<h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Amitriptyline hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients who have shown prior <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> to it.</p>
<p>It should not be given concomitantly with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Hyperpyretic crises, severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> have occurred in patients receiving tricyclic antidepressant and monoamine oxidase inhibiting drugs simultaneously. When it is desired to replace a monoamine oxidase inhibitor with amitriptyline hydrochloride, a minimum of 14 days should be allowed to elapse after the former is discontinued. Amitriptyline hydrochloride should then be initiated cautiously with a gradual increase in dosage until optimum response is achieved.</p>
<p>Amitriptyline hydrochloride should not be given with Cisapride due to the potential for increased QT interval and increased risk for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span>.</p>

<h3>Clinical Worsening and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> Risk:</h3>
<p class="First">Patients with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and/or the emergence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4092095" conceptname="Planning suicide">suicidal ideation</span> and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> is a known risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18–24) with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.</p>
<p>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440374" conceptname="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">obsessive compulsive disorder</span> (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.</p>

<p>No <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>.</p>
<p>It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months.

<h3>Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder:</h3>
<p class="First">A major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive episode</span> may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic episode</span> in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4191716" conceptname="Symptoms of depression">depressive symptoms</span> should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>, bipolar disorder, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>. It should be noted that amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets are not approved for use in treating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436665" conceptname="Bipolar disorder">bipolar depression</span>.</p>
<p>Amitriptyline hydrochloride may block the antihypertensive action of guanethidine or similarly acting compounds.</p>
<p>It should be used with caution in patients with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> and, because of its atropine-like action, in patients with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192450" conceptname="Retention of urine">urinary retention</span>, angle-closure <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437541" conceptname="Glaucoma">glaucoma</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4011560" conceptname="Raised intraocular pressure">increased intraocular pressure</span>. In patients with angle-closure <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437541" conceptname="Glaucoma">glaucoma</span>, even average doses may precipitate an attack.</p>
<p>Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134057" conceptname="Disorder of cardiovascular system">cardiovascular disorders</span> should be watched closely. Tricyclic antidepressant drugs, including amitriptyline hydrochloride, particularly when given in high doses, have been reported to produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4007310" conceptname="Sinus tachycardia">sinus tachycardia</span>, and prolongation of the conduction time. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">Myocardial infarction</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> have been reported with drugs of this class.</p>
<p>Close supervision is required when amitriptyline hydrochloride is given to hyperthyroid patients or those receiving thyroid medication.</p>
<p>Amitriptyline hydrochloride may enhance the response to alcohol and the effects of barbiturates and other CNS depressants. In patients who may use alcohol excessively, it should be borne in mind that the potentiation may increase the danger inherent in any <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4219484" conceptname="Suicide attempt">suicide attempt</span> or overdosage. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373995" conceptname="Delirium">Delirium</span> has been reported with concurrent administration of amitriptyline and disulfiram.</p>

<h4><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category C –</span></h4>
<p class="First">Teratogenic effects were not observed in mice, rats, or rabbits when amitriptyline was given orally at doses of 2 to 40 mg/kg/day (up to 13 times the maximum recommended human dose*). Studies in literature have shown amitriptyline to be teratogenic in mice and hamsters when given by various routes of administration at doses of 28 to 100 mg/kg/day (9 to 33 times the maximum recommended human dose), producing multiple malformations. Another study in the rat reported that an oral dose of 25 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum recommended human dose) produced delays in ossification of fetal vertebral bodies without other signs of embryotoxicity. In rabbits, an oral dose of 60 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum recommended human dose) was reported to cause incomplete ossification of the cranial bones.</p>
<p>Amitriptyline has been shown to cross the placenta. Although a causal relationship has not been established, there have been a few reports of adverse events, including CNS effects, limb deformities, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436077" conceptname="Developmental delay">developmental delay</span>, in infants whose mothers had taken amitriptyline during pregnancy. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Amitriptyline hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<h3>Nursing Mothers:</h3>
<p class="First">Amitriptyline is excreted into breast milk. In one report in which a patient received amitriptyline 100 mg/day while nursing her infant, levels of 83 to 141 ng/mL were detected in the mother's serum. Levels of 135 to 151 ng/mL were found in the breast milk, but no trace of the drug could be detected in the infant's serum.</p>
<p>Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from amitriptyline, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Schizophrenic patients may develop increased symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychosis</span>; patients with paranoid symptomatology may have an exaggeration of such symptoms. Depressed patients, particularly those with known <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span>-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive illness</span>, may experience a shift to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">mania</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333678" conceptname="Hypomania">hypomania</span>. In these circumstances the dose of amitriptyline may be reduced or a major tranquilizer such as perphenazine may be administered concurrently.</p>
<p>The possibility of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span> in depressed patients remains until significant remission occurs. Potentially suicidal patients should not have access to large quantities of this drug. Prescriptions should be written for the smallest amount feasible.</p>
<p>Concurrent administration of amitriptyline hydrochloride and electroshock therapy may increase the hazards associated with such therapy. Such treatment should be limited to patients for whom it is essential.</p>
<p>When possible, the drug should be discontinued several days before elective surgery.</p>
<p>Both elevation and lowering of blood sugar levels have been reported.</p>

<h4><span class="Bold">Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6 –</span></h4>
<p class="First">The biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase) is reduced in a subset of the Caucasian population (about 7 to 10% of Caucasians are so called "poor metabolizers"); reliable estimates of the prevalence of reduced P450 2D6 isozyme activity among Asian, African and other populations are not yet available. Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) when given usual doses. Depending on the fraction of drug metabolized by P450 2D6, the increase in plasma concentration may be small, or quite large (8-fold increase in plasma AUC of the TCA).</p>
<p>In addition, certain drugs inhibit the activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers. An individual who is stable on a given dose of TCA may become abruptly toxic when given one of these inhibiting drugs as concomitant therapy. The drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 include some that are not metabolized by the enzyme (quinidine; cimetidine) and many that are substrates for P450 2D6 (many other antidepressants, phenothiazines, and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide). While all the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine, inhibit P450 2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition. The extent to which SSRI-TCA interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree              of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the coadministration of TCAs with any of SSRIs and also in switching from one class to the other. Of particular importance, sufficient time must elapse before initiating TCA treatment in a patient being withdrawn from fluoxetine, given the long half-life of the parent and active metabolite (at least 5 weeks may be necessary).</p>
<p>Concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the tricyclic antidepressant or the other drug. Furthermore, whenever one of these other drugs is withdrawn from co-therapy, an increased dose of tricyclic antidepressant may be required. It is desirable to monitor TCA plasma levels whenever a TCA is going to be coadministered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6.</p>

<p>Cimetidine is reported to reduce hepatic metabolism of certain tricyclic antidepressants, thereby delaying elimination and increasing steady-state concentrations of these drugs. Clinically significant effects have been reported with the tricyclic antidepressants when used concomitantly with cimetidine. Increases in plasma levels of tricyclic antidepressants, and in the frequency and severity of side effects, particularly anticholinergic, have been reported when cimetidine was added to the drug regimen. Discontinuation of cimetidine in well-controlled patients receiving tricyclic antidepressants and cimetidine may decrease the plasma levels and efficacy of the antidepressants.</p>
<p>Caution is advised if patients receive large doses of ethchlorvynol concurrently. Transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373995" conceptname="Delirium">delirium</span> has been reported in patients who were treated with one gram of ethchlorvynol and 75 to 150 mg of amitriptyline hydrochloride.</p>

<h3>Geriatric Use:</h3>
<p class="First">Clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic function, concomitant disease and other drug therapy in elderly patients.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Dosage should be initiated at a low level and increased gradually, noting carefully the clinical response and any evidence of intolerance.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">

<h3>Initial Dosage for Adults:</h3>
<p class="First">For outpatients 75 mg of amitriptyline HCl a day in divided doses is usually satisfactory. If necessary, this may be increased to a total of 150 mg per day. Increases are made preferably in the late afternoon and/or bedtime doses. A sedative effect may be apparent before the antidepressant effect is noted, but an adequate therapeutic effect may take as long as 30 days to develop.</p>
<p>An alternate method of initiating therapy in outpatients is to begin with 50 to 100 mg amitriptyline HCl at bedtime. This may be increased by 25 or 50 mg as necessary in the bedtime dose to a total of 150 mg per day.</p>
<p>Hospitalized patients may require 100 mg a day initially. This can be increased gradually to 200 mg a day if necessary. A small number of hospitalized patients may need as much as 300 mg a day.</p>

<h3>Adolescent and Elderly Patients:</h3>
<p class="First">In general, lower dosages are recommended for these patients. Ten mg 3 times a day with 20 mg at bedtime may be satisfactory in adolescent and elderly patients who do not tolerate higher dosages.</p>
</div>

<h3>Maintenance:</h3>
<p class="First">The usual maintenance dosage of amitriptyline HCl is 50 to 100 mg per day. In some patients 40 mg per day is sufficient. For maintenance therapy the total daily dosage may be given in a single dose preferably at bedtime. When satisfactory improvement has been reached, dosage should be reduced to the lowest amount that will maintain relief of symptoms. It is appropriate to continue maintenance therapy 3 months or longer to lessen the possibility of relapse.</p>

<h3>Usage in Pediatric Patients</h3>
<p class="First">In view of the lack of experience with the use of this drug in pediatric patients, it is not recommended at the present time for patients under 12 years of age.</p>
</div>

<h3>Plasma Levels</h3>
<p class="First">Because of the wide variation in the absorption and distribution of tricyclic antidepressants in body fluids, it is difficult to directly correlate plasma levels and therapeutic effect. However, determination of plasma levels may be useful in identifying patients who appear to have toxic effects and may have excessively high levels, or those in whom lack of absorption or noncompliance is suspected. Because of increased intestinal transit time and decreased hepatic metabolism in elderly patients, plasma levels are generally higher for a given oral dose of amitriptyline hydrochloride than in younger patients. Elderly patients should be monitored carefully and quantitative serum levels obtained as clinically appropriate. Adjustment in dosage should be made according to the patient's clinical response and not on the basis of plasma levels.**</p>

<h1>METABOLISM</h1>
<p class="First">Studies in man following oral administration of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-labeled drug indicated that amitriptyline is rapidly absorbed and metabolized. Radioactivity of the plasma was practically negligible, although significant amounts of radioactivity appeared in the urine by 4 to 6 hours and one-half to one-third of the drug was excreted within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Amitriptyline is metabolized by N-demethylation and bridge hydroxylation in man, rabbit and rat. Virtually the entire dose is excreted as glucuronide or sulfate conjugate of metabolites, with little unchanged drug appearing in the urine. Other metabolic pathways may be involved.</p>
