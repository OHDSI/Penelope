<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Piroxicam capsules contain piroxicam which is a member of the oxicam group of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Each dark green capsule contains 20 mg piroxicam for oral administration. The chemical name for piroxicam is 4-hydroxy-2-methyl-<span class="Italics">N</span>-2-pyridinyl-2<span class="Italics">H</span>-1,2-benzothiazine-3- carboxamide 1,1-dioxide. Members of the oxicam family are not carboxylic acids, but they are acidic by virtue of the enolic 4-hydroxy substituent. Piroxicam occurs as a white crystalline solid, sparingly soluble in water, dilute acid and most organic solvents. It is slightly soluble in alcohol and in aqueous alkaline solutions. It exhibits a weakly acidic 4-hydroxy proton (pKa 5.1) and a weakly basic pyridyl nitrogen (pKa 1.8). It has the following structural formula:</p>

<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">Piroxicam capsules are a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities in animal models. The mechanism of action of piroxicam, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but may be related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="i4i_section_id_inv-222db4f6-22b6-4c3c-b081-3379c3945a4d"></a><a name="section-2.2.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Absorption</h3>
<p class="First">Piroxicam is well absorbed following oral administration. Drug plasma concentrations are proportional for 10 and 20 mg doses and generally peak within three to five hours after medication. The prolonged half-life (50 hours) results in the maintenance of relatively stable plasma concentrations throughout the day on once daily doses and to significant accumulation upon multiple dosing. A single 20 mg dose generally produces peak piroxicam plasma levels of 1.5 to 2 mcg/mL, while maximum drug plasma concentrations, after repeated daily ingestion of 20 mg piroxicam capsules, usually stabilize at 3 to 8 mcg/mL. Most patients approximate steady- state plasma levels within 7 to 12 days. Higher levels, which approximate steady state at two to three weeks, have been observed in patients in whom longer plasma half-lives of piroxicam occurred.</p>
<p>With food there is a slight delay in the rate but not the extent of absorption following oral administration. The concomitant administration of antacids (aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide with magnesium hydroxide) have been shown to have no effect on the plasma levels of orally administered piroxicam.</p>

<h3>Distribution</h3>
<p class="First">The apparent volume of distribution of piroxicam is approximately 0.14 L/kg. Ninety-nine percent of plasma piroxicam is bound to plasma proteins. Piroxicam is excreted into human milk. The presence in breast milk has been determined during initial and long-term conditions (52 days). Piroxicam appeared in breast milk at about 1% to 3% of the maternal concentration. No accumulation of piroxicam occurred in milk relative to that in plasma during treatment.</p>

<h3>Metabolism</h3>
<p class="First">Metabolism of piroxicam occurs by hydroxylation at the 5 position of the pyridyl side chain and conjugation of this product; by cyclodehydration; and by a sequence of reactions involving hydrolysis of the amide linkage, decarboxylation, ring contraction and <span class="Italics">N</span>-demethylation. The biotransformation products of piroxicam metabolism are reported to not have any anti-inflammatory activity.</p>

<h3>Excretion</h3>
<p class="First">Piroxicam and its biotransformation products are excreted in urine and feces, with about twice as much appearing in the urine as in the feces. Approximately 5% of a piroxicam dose is excreted unchanged. The plasma half-life (T<span class="Sub">Â½</span>) for piroxicam is approximately 50 hours.</p>

<h3>Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</h3>
<p class="First">Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</p>
<p>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI events (see <span class="Bold">GI WARNINGS</span>).</p>
<p>Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> (see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>).</p>

<h3><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">Hypertension</span></h3>
<p class="First">NSAIDs, including piroxicam capsules, can lead to onset of new <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> or worsening of preexisting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events.

<h2>Gastrointestinal Effects - Risk of Ulceration, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">Bleeding</span> and Perforation</h2>
<p class="First">NSAIDs, including piroxicam capsules, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcers</span>, gross <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2 to 4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk.</p>
<p>NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcer</span> disease or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">gastrointestinal bleeding</span>. Patients with a <span class="Italics">prior history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4027663" conceptname="Peptic ulcer">peptic ulcer disease</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">gastrointestinal bleeding</span></span> who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10 fold increased risk for developing a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">GI bleed</span> compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.</p>
<p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulcerations and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high-risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.</p>

Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE-inhibitors, and the elderly.

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Piroxicam capsules cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids.</p>
<p>The pharmacological activity of piroxicam capsules in reducing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.</p>

<h2>Hepatic Effects</h2>
<p class="First">Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including piroxicam capsules. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with continuing therapy. Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately three or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span> and fatal fulminant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4337543" conceptname="Hepatic necrosis">liver necrosis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic failure</span>, some of them with fatal outcomes have been reported.</p>
<p>A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with piroxicam capsules. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302954" conceptname="Disorder characterized by eosinophilia">eosinophilia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>, etc.), piroxicam capsules should be discontinued (see <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>).</p>

<h3>Highly Protein Bound Drugs</h3>
<p class="First">Piroxicam is highly protein bound and, therefore, might be expected to displace other protein bound drugs. Physicians should closely monitor patients for a change in dosage requirements when administering piroxicam capsules to patients on other highly protein bound drugs.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">

<h3>Aspirin</h3>
<p class="First">When piroxicam is administered with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free piroxicam is not altered. Plasma levels of piroxicam are depressed to approximately 80% of their normal values when piroxicam is administered (20 mg/day) in conjunction with aspirin (3900 mg/day). The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of piroxicam capsules and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential for increased adverse effects.</p>

<h3>Methotrexate</h3>
<p class="First">NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.</p>
</div>

<h3>ACE-Inhibitors</h3>
<p class="First">Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors.</p>

<h3>Diuretics</h3>
<p class="First">Clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations, have shown that piroxicam capsules can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>, <span class="Bold">Renal Effects</span>), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.</p>

<h3>Lithium</h3>
<p class="First">NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium toxicity</span>.</p>

<h3>Warfarin</h3>
<p class="First">The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> higher than users of either drug alone.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Subacute, acute and chronic toxicity studies have been carried out in rats, mice, dogs, and monkeys.

<h4>Pregnancy category C</h4>
<p class="First">Reproductive studies conducted in rats and rabbits have not demonstrated evidence of developmental abnormalities. However, animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Piroxicam capsules are not recommended for use in pregnant women since safety has not been established in humans. Piroxicam capsules should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<h3>Nonteratogenic Effects</h3>
<p class="First">Because of the known effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of ductus arteriosus), use during pregnancy (particularly late pregnancy) should be avoided. In animal studies of piroxicam, gastrointestinal tract toxicity was increased in pregnant females in the last trimester of pregnancy compared to nonpregnant females or females in earlier trimesters of pregnancy.</p>

<h2>Labor and Delivery</h2>
<p class="First">In rat studies with NSAIDs, as with other drugs known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, an increased incidence of dystocia, delayed parturition, and decreased pup survival occurred. The effects of piroxicam on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Piroxicam is excreted into human milk. The presence in breast milk has been determined during initial and long-term conditions (52 days). Piroxicam appeared in breast milk at about 1% to 3% of the maternal concentration. No accumulation of piroxicam occurred in milk relative to that in plasma during treatment. Piroxicam capsules are not recommended for use in nursing mothers.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">As with any NSAID, caution should be exercised in treating the elderly (65 years and older). Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events with NSAIDs are in the elderly or debilitated patients and, therefore, care should be taken in treating this population. In addition to a past history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcer</span> disease, older age and poor general health status (among other factors) may increase the risk for GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>. To minimize the potential risk of an adverse GI event, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>, <span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal Effects â€“ Risk of GI Ulceration</span><span class="Bold">,</span><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">Bleeding</span> and Perforation</span>).</p>
<p>As with all other NSAIDs, there is a risk of developing renal toxicity in patients in which renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in maintenance of renal perfusion. Discontinuation of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>, <span class="Bold">Renal Effects</span>).</p>
<p>In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting a greater frequency of impaired drug elimination and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>

<p>Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. There are no specific antidotes. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">Emesis</span> and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in children) and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated. The long plasma half-life of piroxicam should be considered when treating an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> with piroxicam. Experiments in dogs have demonstrated that the use of multiple-dose treatments with activated charcoal could reduce the half-life of piroxicam by more than 50% and systemic bioavailability by as much as 37% when activated charcoal is given as late as 6 hours after ingestion of piroxicam.

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of piroxicam capsules and other treatment options before deciding to use piroxicam capsules. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p>
<p>After observing the response to initial therapy with piroxicam capsules, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.</p>
<p>For the relief of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80180" conceptname="Osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</span>, the recommended dose is 20 mg given orally once per day. If desired, the daily dose may be divided. Because of the long half-life of piroxicam capsules, steady-state blood levels are not reached for 7 to 12 days. Therefore, although the therapeutic effects of piroxicam are evident early in treatment, there is a progressive increase in response over several weeks and the effect of therapy should not be assessed for two weeks.</p>
