<h2>5.2 Effects on Endocrine System</h2>
<p class="First">Taclonex<span class="Sup">®</span> Ointment can cause reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of treatment. Factors that predispose a patient to HPA axis suppression include the use of high-potency corticosteroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, concomitant use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">liver failure</span>, and young age. Evaluation for HPA axis suppression may be done by using the cosyntropin stimulation test. <span class="Italics">[See <a href="#S12.2">Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)</a>]</span></p>
<p>In a trial evaluating the effects of Taclonex<span class="Sup">®</span> Topical Suspension and Taclonex<span class="Sup">®</span> Ointment on the HPA axis, 32 adult subjects were treated with Taclonex<span class="Sup">®</span> Topical Suspension on the scalp and Taclonex<span class="Sup">®</span> Ointment on the body. Adrenal suppression was identified in 5 of 32 subjects (15.6%) after 4 weeks of treatment <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#S12.2">Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)</a>]</span>. The effects of Taclonex<span class="Sup">®</span> Ointment on the HPA axis following treatment durations of longer than 4 weeks have not been adequately studied.</p>
<p>If HPA axis suppression is documented, gradually withdraw the drug, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute with a less potent corticosteroid.</p>
<p>Cushing's syndrome and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span> may also occur due to the systemic effects of topical corticosteroids. These complications are rare and generally occur after prolonged exposure to excessively large doses, especially of high-potency topical corticosteroids.</p>
<p>Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity due to their higher skin surface to body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> ratios<span class="Italics"> [see <a href="#S8.4">Use in Specific Populations (8.4)</a>, <a href="#S12.2">Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic corticosteroid exposure.</p>

<h2>8.1 Pregnancy</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C</span></p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Taclonex<span class="Sup">®</span> Ointment should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the patient justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Taclonex<span class="Sup">®</span> Ointment. Taclonex<span class="Sup">®</span> Ointment contains calcipotriene that has been shown to be fetotoxic and betamethasone dipropionate that has been shown to be teratogenic in animals when given systemically.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">Teratogenicity</span> studies with calcipotriene were performed by the oral route in rats and rabbits. In rabbits, increased maternal and fetal toxicity were noted at a dosage of 12 mcg/kg/day (144 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day); a dosage of 36 mcg/kg/day (432 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day) resulted in a significant increase in the incidence of incomplete ossification of the pubic bones and forelimb phalanges of fetuses. In a rat study, a dosage of 54 mcg/kg/day (324 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day) resulted in a significantly increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities (enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs). The enlarged fontanelles are most likely due to the effect of calcipotriene upon calcium metabolism. The estimated maternal and fetal no-adverse effect levels (NOAEL) in the rat (108 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day) and rabbit (48 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day) derived from oral studies are lower than the estimated maximum topical dose of calcipotriene in man (460 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day).</p>
<p><br>Corticosteroids are generally teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. <br><br>Betamethasone dipropionate has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and rabbits when given by the subcutaneous route at dosages of 156 mcg/kg/day (468 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day) and 2.5 mcg/kg/day (30 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day), respectively. Those dose levels are lower than the estimated maximum topical dose in man (about 5950 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day).

No remarkable effects were observed on any parameter, including survival, behavior, body weight, litter parameters, or the ability to nurse or rear pups.<br><br>Betamethasone dipropionate was evaluated for effects when orally administered to pregnant rats from gestation day 6 through day 20 postpartum at dosages of 0, 100, 300, and 1000 mcg/kg/day. Mean maternal body weight was significantly reduced on gestation day 20 in animals dosed at 300 and 1000 mcg/kg/day. The mean duration of gestation was slightly, but statistically significantly, increased at 100, 300, and 1000 mcg/kg/day. The mean percentage of pups that survived to day 4 was reduced in relation to dosage. On lactation day 5, the percentage of pups with a reflex to right themselves when placed on their back was significantly reduced at 1000 mcg/kg/day. No effects on the ability of pups to learn were observed, and the ability of the offspring of treated rats to reproduce was not affected.</p>

<h2>12.3 Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p>
<p>In Trial C described above, the systemic effect of Taclonex<span class="Sup">®</span> Ointment in extensive plaque <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span> was investigated. In this study, the serum levels of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate and their major metabolites were measured after 4 weeks (maximum recommended duration of treatment) and also after 8 weeks of once daily application of Taclonex<span class="Sup">®</span> Ointment on the body in combination with Taclonex Scalp<span class="Sup">®</span> Topical Suspension on the scalp. Both calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate were below the lower limit of quantification in all serum samples of the 34 subjects evaluated. However, one major metabolite of calcipotriene (MC1080) was quantifiable in 10 of 34 (29.4%) subjects at week 4 and in five of 12 (41.7%) subjects at week 8. The major metabolite of betamethasone dipropionate, betamethasone 17-propionate (B17P) was also quantifiable in 19 of 34 (55.9%) subjects at week 4 and seven of 12 (58.3%) subjects at week 8. The serum concentrations for MC1080 ranged from 20-75 pg/mL. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Calcipotriene:</span><br>Calcipotriene metabolism following systemic uptake is rapid and occurs in the liver. The primary metabolites of calcipotriene are less potent than the parent compound.</p>
<p>Calcipotriene is metabolized to MC1046 (the alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone analogue of calcipotriene), which is metabolized further to MC1080 (a saturated ketone analogue). MC1080 is the major metabolite in plasma. MC1080 is slowly metabolized to calcitroic acid.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Betamethasone dipropionate:</span><br>Betamethasone dipropionate is metabolized to betamethasone 17-propionate and betamethasone, including the 6beta-hydroxy derivatives of those compounds by hydrolysis. Betamethasone 17-propionate (B17P) is the primary metabolite.</p>

<p>In a study in which albino hairless mice were exposed to both ultra-violet radiation (UVR) and topically applied calcipotriene, a reduction in the time required for UVR to induce the formation of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135777" conceptname="Neoplasm of uncertain behavior of skin">skin tumors</span> was observed (statistically significant in males only), suggesting that calcipotriene may enhance the effect of UVR to induce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135777" conceptname="Neoplasm of uncertain behavior of skin">skin tumors</span>.</p>
<p>A 104-week oral carcinogenicity study was conducted with calcipotriene in male and female rats at doses of 1, 5 and 15 mcg/kg/day (corresponding to dosages of approximately 6, 30, and 90 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day). Beginning week 71, the dosage for high-dose animals of both genders was reduced to 10 mcg/kg/day (corresponding to a dosage of approximately 60 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day). A treatment-related increase in benign C-cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> was observed in the thyroid of females that received 15 mcg/kg/day. A treatment-related increase in benign <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118993" conceptname="Pheochromocytoma">pheochromocytomas</span> was observed in the adrenal glands of males that received 15 mcg/kg/day. No other statistically significant differences in tumor incidence were observed when compared to control. The relevance of these findings to patients is unknown.</p>
<p>When betamethasone dipropionate was applied topically to CD-1 mice for up to 24 months at dosages approximating 1.3, 4.2 and 8.5 mcg/kg/day in females, and 1.3, 4.2, and 12.9 mcg/kg/day in males (corresponding to dosages of up to approximately 26 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day and 39 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, in females and males, respectively), no significant changes in tumor incidence were observed when compared to control.</p>
<p>When betamethasone dipropionate was administered via oral gavage to male and female Sprague Dawley rats for up to 24 months at dosages of 20, 60, and 200 mcg/kg/day (corresponding to dosages of approximately 120, 360, and 1200 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day), no significant changes in tumor incidence were observed when compared to control.</p>
<p>Calcipotriene did not elicit any genotoxic effects in the Ames mutagenicity assay, the mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> TK locus assay, the human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, or the mouse micronucleus test. Betamethasone dipropionate did not elicit any genotoxic effects in the Ames mutagenicity assay, the mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> TK locus assay, or in the rat micronucleus test.</p>
<p>Studies in rats with oral doses of up to 54 mcg/kg/day (324 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day) of calcipotriene indicated no impairment of fertility or general reproductive performance. Studies in male rats at oral doses of up to 200 mcg/kg/day (1200 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day), and in female rats at oral doses of up to 1000 mcg/kg/day (6000 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day), of betamethasone dipropionate indicated no impairment of fertility.</p>

<p>In an international, multi-center, double-blind, vehicle- and active-controlled, parallel-group trial, 1603 subjects with mild to very severe plaque psoriasis on trunk and limbs were treated once daily for 4 weeks. Subjects were randomized to one of four treatment arms: Taclonex<span class="Sup">®</span> Ointment, calcipotriene hydrate 50 mcg/g in the same vehicle, betamethasone dipropionate 0.64 mg/g in the same vehicle, and vehicle alone. The mean age of the subjects was 48.4 years and 60.5% were male. Most subjects had disease of moderate severity at baseline.</p>
<p>Efficacy was assessed as the proportion of subjects with absent or very mild disease according to the Investigator's Global Assessment of Disease Severity at end of treatment (4 weeks). "Absent" disease was defined as no evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">redness</span>, thickness, or scaling. "Very mild disease" was defined as controlled disease, but not entirely cleared: lesions with some discoloration with absolutely minimal thickness, i.e. the edges to the lesions(s) could just be felt. Table 3 contains the response rates for this trial.</p>
