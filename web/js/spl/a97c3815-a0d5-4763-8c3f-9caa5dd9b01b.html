<h1>DESCRIPTION:</h1>
<p class="First">Each <span class="Bold">Asacol<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span></span> delayed-release tablet for oral administration contains 400 mg of mesalamine, an anti-inflammatory drug.  The <span class="Bold">Asacol</span> delayed-release tablets are coated with acrylic based resin, Eudragit S (methacrylic acid copolymer B, NF), which dissolves at pH 7 or greater, releasing mesalamine in the terminal ileum and beyond for topical anti-inflammatory action in the colon.  Mesalamine has the chemical name 5-amino-2-hydroxybenzoic acid; its structural formula is:</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</h1>
<p class="First">Mesalamine is thought to be the major therapeutically active part of the sulfasalazine molecule in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="81893" conceptname="Ulcerative colitis">ulcerative colitis</span>.  Sulfasalazine is converted to equimolar amounts of sulfapyridine and mesalamine by bacterial action in the colon.  The usual oral dose of sulfasalazine for active <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="81893" conceptname="Ulcerative colitis">ulcerative colitis</span> is 3 to 4 grams daily in divided doses, which provides 1.2 to 1.6 grams of mesalamine to the colon.</p>
<p>The mechanism of action of mesalamine (and sulfasalazine) is unknown, but appears to be topical rather than systemic.  Mucosal production of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes (LTs) and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), is increased in patients with chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4074815" conceptname="Inflammatory bowel disease">inflammatory bowel disease</span>, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin (PG) production in the colon.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics:</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Asacol</span> tablets are coated with an acrylic-based resin that delays release of mesalamine until it reaches the terminal ileum and beyond.  This has been demonstrated in human studies conducted with radiological and serum markers.  Approximately 28% of the mesalamine in <span class="Bold">Asacol</span> tablets is absorbed after oral ingestion, leaving the remainder available for topical action and excretion in the feces.  Absorption of mesalamine is similar in fasted and fed subjects.  The absorbed mesalamine is rapidly acetylated in the gut mucosal wall and by the liver.  It is excreted mainly by the kidney as N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid.</p>
<p>Mesalamine from orally administered <span class="Bold">Asacol</span> tablets appears to be more extensively absorbed than the mesalamine released from sulfasalazine.  Maximum plasma levels of mesalamine and N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid following multiple <span class="Bold">Asacol</span> doses are about 1.5 to 2 times higher than those following an equivalent dose of mesalamine in the form of sulfasalazine.  Combined mesalamine and N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid AUC’s and urine drug dose recoveries following multiple doses of <span class="Bold">Asacol</span> tablets are about 1.3 to 1.5 times higher than those following an equivalent dose of mesalamine in the form of sulfasalazine.</p>
<p>The t<span class="Sub">max</span> for mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid, is usually delayed, reflecting the delayed release, and ranges from 4 to 12 hours.  The half-lives of elimination (t1/2<span class="Sub">elm</span>) for mesalamine and N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid are usually about 12 hours, but are variable, ranging from 2 to 15 hours.  There is a large intersubject variability in the plasma concentrations of mesalamine and N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid and in their elimination half-lives following administration of <span class="Bold">Asacol</span> tablets.</p>

<p class="First">Two placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated the efficacy of <span class="Bold">Asacol</span> tablets in patients with mildly to moderately active <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="81893" conceptname="Ulcerative colitis">ulcerative colitis</span>.  In one randomized, double-blind, multi-center trial of 158 patients, <span class="Bold">Asacol</span> doses of 1.6 g/day and 2.4 g/day were compared to placebo.  At the dose of 2.4 g/day, <span class="Bold">Asacol</span> tablets reduced the disease activity, with 21 of 43 (49%) <span class="Bold">Asacol</span> patients showing improvement in sigmoidoscopic appearance of the bowel compared to 12 of 44 (27%) placebo patients (p = 0.048).  In addition, significantly more patients in the <span class="Bold">Asacol</span> 2.4 g/day group showed improvement in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197925" conceptname="Hemorrhage of rectum and anus">rectal bleeding</span> and stool frequency.  The 1.6 g/day dose did not produce consistent evidence of effectiveness.</p>
<p>In a second randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 6 weeks duration in 87 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="81893" conceptname="Ulcerative colitis">ulcerative colitis</span> patients, <span class="Bold">Asacol</span> tablets, at a dose of 4.8 g/day, gave sigmoidoscopic improvement in 28 of 38 (74%) patients compared to 10 of 38 (26%) placebo patients (p &lt; 0.001).  Also, more patients in the <span class="Bold">Asacol</span> 4.8 g/day group showed improvement in overall symptoms.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Maintenance of remission of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="81893" conceptname="Ulcerative colitis">ulcerative colitis</span>:</span></h2>
<p class="First">A 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study involved 264 patients treated with <span class="Bold">Asacol</span> 0.8 g/day (n = 90), 1.6 g/day (n = 87), or placebo (n = 87).  The proportion of patients treated with 0.8 g/day who maintained endoscopic remission was not statistically significant compared to placebo.  In the intention to treat (ITT) analysis of all 174 patients treated with <span class="Bold">Asacol</span> 1.6 g/day or placebo, <span class="Bold">Asacol</span> maintained endoscopic remission of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="81893" conceptname="Ulcerative colitis">ulcerative colitis</span> in 61 of 87 (70.1%) of patients, compared to 42 of 87 (48.3%) of placebo recipients (p = 0.005).</p>
<p>A pooled efficacy analysis of 4 maintenance trials compared <span class="Bold">Asacol</span>, at doses of 0.8 g/day to 2.8 g/day, with sulfasalazine, at doses of 2 g/day to 4 g/day (n = 200).  Treatment success was 59 of 98 (59%) for <span class="Bold">Asacol</span> and 70 of 102 (69%) for sulfasalazine, a non-significant difference.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:</h2>
<p class="First">Dietary mesalamine was not carcinogenic in rats at doses as high as 480 mg/kg/day, or in mice at 2000 mg/kg/day. These doses are 2.4 and 5.1 times the maximum recommended human maintenance dose of <span class="Bold">Asacol</span> of 1.6 g/day (32 mg/kg/day if 50 kg body weight assumed or 1184 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>), respectively, based on body surface area.  Mesalamine was negative in the Ames assay for mutagenesis, negative for induction of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) and chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>, and negative for induction of micronuclei (MN) in mouse bone marrow polychromatic erythrocytes.  Mesalamine, at oral doses up to 480 mg/kg/day (about 1.6 times the recommended human treatment dose on a body surface area basis), was found to have no effect on fertility or reproductive performance of male and female rats.</p>

<h2>Pregnancy:</h2>
<p class="First">Pregnancy Category C:  There are no adequate and well controlled studies of <span class="Bold">Asacol </span>use in pregnant women.  Limited published human data on mesalamine show no increase in the overall rate of congenital malformations.  Some data show an increased rate of preterm birth, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443213" conceptname="Stillbirth">stillbirth</span>, and low birth weight; however, these adverse pregnancy outcomes are also associated with active <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4074815" conceptname="Inflammatory bowel disease">inflammatory bowel disease</span>. Animal reproduction studies of mesalamine found no evidence of fetal harm.  However, dibutyl phthalate (DBP) is an inactive ingredient in <span class="Bold">Asacol’s</span> enteric coating, and in animal studies at doses &gt;190 times the human dose based on body surface area, maternal DBP was associated with external and skeletal malformations and adverse effects on the male reproductive system. <span class="Bold">Asacol</span> should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<p>Mesalamine crosses the placenta. In prospective and retrospective studies of over 600 women exposed to mesalamine during pregnancy, the observed rate of congenital malformations was not increased above the background rate in the general population. Some data show an increased rate of preterm birth, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443213" conceptname="Stillbirth">stillbirth</span>, and low birth weight, but it is unclear whether this was due to underlying maternal disease, drug exposure, or both, as active <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4074815" conceptname="Inflammatory bowel disease">inflammatory bowel disease</span> is also associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. </p>
<p>Reproduction studies with mesalamine were performed during organogenesis in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 480 mg/kg/day. There was no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. These mesalamine doses were about 1.6 times (rat) and 3.2 times (rabbit) the recommended human dose, based on body surface area.   </p>
<p>Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) is an inactive ingredient in <span class="Bold">Asacol</span>’s enteric coating.  The human daily intake of DBP from the maximum recommended dose of <span class="Bold">Asacol</span> tablets is about 21 mg.  Published reports in rats show that male rat offspring exposed in utero to DBP (≥100 mg/kg/day, approximately 39 times the human dose based on body surface area), display reproductive system aberrations compatible with disruption of androgenic dependent development.  The clinical significance of this finding in rats is unknown.  At higher dosages (≥500 mg/kg/day, approximately 194 times the human dose based on body surface area), additional effects, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437655" conceptname="Undescended testicle">cryptorchidism</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196528" conceptname="Hypospadias">hypospadias</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4028206" conceptname="Atrophy">atrophy</span> or agenesis of sex accessory organs, testicular injury, reduced daily sperm production, permanent retention of nipples, and decreased anogenital distance are noted.  Female offspring are unaffected. High doses of DBP, administered to pregnant rats was associated with increased incidences of developmental abnormalities, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135923" conceptname="Cleft palate">cleft palate</span> (≥630 mg/kg/day, about 244 times the human dose, based on body surface area) and skeletal abnormalities (≥750 mg/kg/day, about 290 times the human dose based on body surface area) in the offspring.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers:</h2>
<p class="First">Mesalamine and its N-acetyl metabolite are excreted into human milk. In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 3 g daily.  The concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.11 mg/L. The concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid metabolite ranged from 5 to 18.1 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily doses for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.017 mg/kg/day of mesalamine and 0.75 to 2.72 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. Caution should be exercised when <span class="Bold">Asacol</span> is administered to a nursing woman. </p>
<p>Dibutyl phthalate (DBP), an inactive ingredient in the enteric coating of <span class="Bold">Asacol</span> tablets, and its primary metabolite mono-butyl phthalate (MBP) are excreted into human milk.

<h2>Geriatric Use:</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of <span class="Bold">Asacol</span> did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.  Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.  In general, the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients should be considered when prescribing <span class="Bold">Asacol</span>.  Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and post-marketing reporting systems suggest a higher incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="40528016" conceptname="Disorder of hematopoietic system">blood dyscrasias</span>, i.e., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440689" conceptname="Agranulocytosis">agranulocytosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432881" conceptname="Pancytopenia">pancytopenia</span>, in subjects receiving <span class="Bold">Asacol</span> who are 65 years or older.  Caution should be taken to closely monitor blood cell counts during drug therapy.</p>
<p>This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>.  Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken when prescribing this drug therapy.  As stated in the PRECAUTIONS section, it is recommended that all patients have an evaluation of renal function prior to initiation of <span class="Bold">Asacol</span> tablets and periodically while on <span class="Bold">Asacol</span> therapy.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE:</h1>
<p class="First">Two cases of pediatric overdosage have been reported.  A 3-year-old male who ingested 2 grams of <span class="Bold">Asacol</span> tablets was treated with ipecac and activated charcoal; no adverse events occurred.  Another 3-year-old male, approximately 16 kg, ingested an unknown amount of a maximum of 24 grams of <span class="Bold">Asacol</span> crushed in solution (i.e., uncoated mesalamine); he was treated with orange juice and activated charcoal, and experienced no adverse events.  In dogs, single doses of 6 grams of delayed-release <span class="Bold">Asacol</span> tablets resulted in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4152839" conceptname="Acute papillary necrosis">renal papillary necrosis</span> but were not fatal.  This was approximately 12.5 times the recommended human dose (based on a dose of 2.4 g/day in a 50 kg person).  Single oral doses of uncoated mesalamine in mice and rats of 5000 mg/kg and 4595 mg/kg, respectively, or of 3000 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys, caused significant lethality.</p>
