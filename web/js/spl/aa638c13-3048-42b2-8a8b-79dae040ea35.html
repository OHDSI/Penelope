<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Sodium phenylbutyrate is a pro-drug and is rapidly metabolized to phenylacetate. Phenylacetate is a metabolically-active compound that conjugates with glutamine via acetylation to form phenylacetylglutamine. Phenylacetylglutamine then is excreted by the kidneys. On a molar basis, it is comparable to urea (each containing two moles of nitrogen). Therefore, phenylacetylglutamine provides an alternate vehicle for waste nitrogen excretion.</p>

<h2>Disposition:</h2>
<p class="First">The overall disposition of sodium phenylbutyrate and its metabolites has not been characterized fully. However, the drug is known to be metabolized to phenylacetate and subsequently to phenylacetylglutamine. Following oral administration of 5 grams (tablets), measurable plasma levels of phenylbutyrate and phenylacetate were detected 15 and 30 minutes after dosing, respectively, and phenylacetylglutamine was detected shortly thereafter. The pharmacokinetic parameters for phenylbutyrate for C<span class="Sub">max</span> (Âµg/mL), T<span class="Sub">max</span> (hours), and elimination half-life (hours) were 218, 1.35, and 0.77, respectively, and for phenylacetate were 48.5, 3.74, and 1.15, respectively.<br>
			Following oral administration of 5 grams of the powder, measurable plasma levels of phenylbutyrate and phenylacetate were detected 15 and 30 minutes after dosing, respectively, and phenylacetylglutamine was detected shortly thereafter. The pharmacokinetic parameters for phenylbutyrate for C<span class="Sub">max</span> (Âµg/mL), T<span class="Sub">max</span> (hours), and elimination half-life (hours) were 195, 1.00, and 0.76, respectively, and for phenylacetate were 45.3, 3.55, and 1.29, respectively.<br>The major sites for metabolism of sodium phenylbutyrate are the liver and kidney.</p>

<h2>Excretion:</h2>
<p class="First">A majority of the administered compound (approximately 80â€“100%) was excreted by the kidneys within 24 hours as the conjugation product, phenylacetylglutamine. For each gram of sodium phenylbutyrate administered, it is estimated that between 0.12â€“0.15 grams of phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen are produced.</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">BUPHENYL is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the chronic management of patients with urea cycle disorders involving deficiencies of carbamylphosphate synthetase (CPS), ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), or argininosuccinic acid synthetase (AS). It is indicated in all patients with neonatal-onset deficiency (complete enzymatic deficiency, presenting within the first 28 days of life). It is also indicated in patients with late-onset disease (partial enzymatic deficiency, presenting after the first month of life) who have a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4143108" conceptname="Hyperammonemic encephalopathy">hyperammonemic encephalopathy</span>. It is important that the diagnosis be made early and treatment initiated immediately to improve survival. Any episode of acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4246681" conceptname="Hyperammonemia">hyperammonemia</span> should be treated as a life-threatening emergency.<br>BUPHENYL must be combined with dietary protein restriction and, in some cases, essential amino acid supplementation. (See <a href="#L4e6f3408-ba78-45d2-beb0-fe6e8e4de034">Nutritional Supplementation subsection</a> of the <a href="#dosandadmin_80d76e48-d905-40a7-a814-1b2bba1e331e">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section</a>.)<br>
			Previously, neonatal-onset disease was almost universally fatal within the first year of life, even when treated with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or their nitrogen-free analogs. However, with hemodialysis, use of alternative waste nitrogen excretion pathways (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate, and sodium phenylacetate), dietary protein restriction, and, in some cases, essential amino acid supplementation, the survival rate in newborns diagnosed after birth but within the first month of life is almost 80%. Most <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> have occurred during an episode of acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4143108" conceptname="Hyperammonemic encephalopathy">hyperammonemic encephalopathy</span>. Patients with neonatal-onset disease have a high incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440389" conceptname="Mental retardation">mental retardation</span>. Those who had IQ tests administered had an incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440389" conceptname="Mental retardation">mental retardation</span> as follows: ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, 100% (14/14 patients tested); argininosuccinic acid synthetase deficiency, 88% (15/17 patients tested); and carbamylphosphate synthetase deficiency, 57% (4/7 patients tested). Retardation was severe in the majority of the retarded patients.<br>
			In patients diagnosed during gestation and treated prior to any episode of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4143108" conceptname="Hyperammonemic encephalopathy">hyperammonemic encephalopathy</span>, survival is 100%, but even in these patients, most subsequently demonstrate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443432" conceptname="Impaired cognition">cognitive impairment</span> or other neurologic deficits.<br>
			In late-onset deficiency patients, including females heterozygous for ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, who recover from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4143108" conceptname="Hyperammonemic encephalopathy">hyperammonemic encephalopathy</span> and are then treated chronically with sodium phenylbutyrate and dietary protein restriction, the survival rate is 98%. The two <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> in this group of patients occurred during episodes of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4143108" conceptname="Hyperammonemic encephalopathy">hyperammonemic encephalopathy</span>. However, compliance with the therapeutic regimen has not been adequately documented to allow evaluation of the potential for BUPHENYL and dietary protein restriction to prevent mental deterioration and recurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4143108" conceptname="Hyperammonemic encephalopathy">hyperammonemic encephalopathy</span> if carefully adhered to. The majority of these patients tested (30/46 or 65%) have IQâ€™s in the average to low average/borderline mentally retarded range. Reversal of pre-existing neurologic impairment is not likely to occur with treatment and neurologic deterioration may continue in some patients.<br>
			Even on therapy, acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4143108" conceptname="Hyperammonemic encephalopathy">hyperammonemic encephalopathy</span> recurred in the majority of patients for whom the drug is indicated.<br>
			BUPHENYL may be required life-long unless orthotopic liver transplantation is elected.<br>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First">Each BUPHENYL Tablet contains 62 mg of sodium (9.2% w/w) (corresponding to 124 mg of sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate [12.4% w/w]) and BUPHENYL Powder contains 11.7 grams of sodium per 100 grams of powder, corresponding to 125 mg of sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate (12.4% w/w). BUPHENYL should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span> or severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>, and in clinical states in which there is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4190305" conceptname="Hypernatremia">sodium retention</span> with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span>.<br>
			Because BUPHENYL is metabolized in the liver and kidney, and phenylacetylglutamine is primarily excreted by the kidney, use caution when administering the drug to patients with hepatic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> or inborn errors of beta oxidation. Probenecid is known to inhibit the renal transport of many organic compounds, including hippuric acid, and may affect renal excretion of the conjugated product of BUPHENYL as well as its metabolite.<br>
			Use of corticosteroids may cause the breakdown of body protein and increase plasma <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184927" conceptname="Ammonia">ammonia</span> levels.</p>

<p class="First">When given subcutaneously to rat pups, 190â€“474 mg/kg phenylacetate caused decreased proliferation and increased loss of neurons, and it reduced CNS myelin. Cerebral synapse maturation was retarded, and the number of functioning nerve terminals in the cerebrum was reduced, which resulted in impaired brain growth. Prenatal exposure of rat pups to phenylacetate produced lesions in layer 5 of the cortical pyramidal cells; dendritic spines were longer and thinner than normal and reduced in number.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">The assessment of clinical adverse events came from 206 patients treated with sodium phenylbutyrate. Adverse events (both clinical and laboratory) were not collected systematically in these patients, but were obtained from patient-visit reports by the 65 co-investigators. Causality of adverse effects is sometimes difficult to determine in this patient population because they may result from either the underlying disease, the patientâ€™s restricted diet, intercurrent illness, or BUPHENYL. Furthermore, the rates may be under-estimated because they were reported primarily by parent or guardian and not the patient.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">For oral use only.<br>The use of BUPHENYL Tablets is indicated for children weighing more than 20 kg and for adults.<br>The usual total daily dose of BUPHENYL Tablets and Powder for patients with urea cycle disorders is 450â€“600 mg/kg/day in patients weighing less than 20 kg, or 9.9â€“13.0 g/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day in larger patients. The tablets and powder are to be taken in Â­equally divided amounts with each meal or feeding (i.e., three to six times per day).<br>BUPHENYL Powder is indicated for oral use (via mouth, gastrostomy, or nasogastric tube) only. The powder is to be mixed with food (solid or liquid) for immediate use; however, when dissolved in water, BUPHENYL Powder has been shown to be stable for up to one week at room temperature or refrigerated. Sodium phenylbutyrate is very soluble in water (5 grams per 10 mL). When BUPHENYL Powder is added to a liquid, only sodium phenylbutyrate will dissolve, the excipients will not. The effect of food on sodium phenylbutyrate has not been determined.<br>Each level teaspoon (enclosed) dispenses 3.2 grams of powder and 3.0 grams of sodium phenylbutyrate. Each level tablespoon (enclosed) dispenses 9.1 grams of powder and 8.6 grams of sodium phenylbutyrate.<br>Shake lightly before use.<br>The safety or efficacy of doses in excess of 20 grams (40 tablets) per day has not been established.</p>

<h1>NUTRITIONAL MANAGEMENT</h1>
<p class="First">To promote growth and development, plasma levels of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184927" conceptname="Ammonia">ammonia</span>, arginine, branched-chain amino acids, and serum protein should be maintained within normal limits while plasma glutamine is maintained at levels less than 1,000 Âµmol/L. Minimum daily protein intake for a patient of a particular age should be taken from, for example, â€œRecommended Dietary Allowancesâ€?, 10th ed., Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Sciences, 1989. The allocation of dietary nitrogen into natural protein and essential amino acids is a function of age, residual urea-cycle enzyme activity, and the dose of sodium phenylbutyrate.<br>At the recommended dose of sodium phenylbutyrate, it is suggested that infants with neonatal-onset CPS and OTC deficiencies initially receive a daily dietary protein intake limited to approximately 1.6 g/kg/day for the first 4 months of life. If tolerated, the daily protein intake may be increased to 1.9 g/kg/day during this period. Protein tolerance will decrease as the growth rate decreases, requiring a reduction in dietary nitrogen intake. From 4 months to 1 year of age, it is recommended that the infant receive at least 1.4 g/kg/day, but 1.7 g/kg/day is advisable. From 1 to 3 years of age, the protein intake should not be less than 1.2 g/kg/day; 1.4 g/kg/day is advisable during this period. For neonatal-onset patients with carbamylphosphate synthetase deficiency or ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency who are at least 6 months of age, it is recommended that the daily protein intake be equally divided between natural protein and supplemental essential amino acids.<br>Patients with argininosuccinic acid synthetase deficiency and those with late-onset disease (partial deficiencies, including females heterozygous for ornithine transcarbamylase), initially may receive a diet containing the age-determined minimal daily natural protein allowance. The protein intake may be increased as tolerated and determined by plasma glutamine and other amino acid levels. However, many patients with partial deficiencies avoid dietary protein.<br>Citrulline supplementation is required and recommended for patients diagnosed with Â­neonatal-onset deficiency of carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithine transcarbamylase; citrulline daily intake is recommended at 0.17 g/kg/day or 3.8 g/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day.<br>The free-base form of arginine may be used instead of citrulline in patients with Â­milder forms of carbamylphosphate synthetase and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (daily intake is recommended at 0.17 g/kg/day or 3.8 g/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day).<br>Arginine supplementation is needed for patients diagnosed with deficiency of argininosuccinic acid synthetase; arginine (free base) daily intake is recommended at 0.4â€“0.7 g/kg/day or 8.8â€“15.4 g/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day.<br>If caloric supplementation is indicated, a protein-free product is recommended. Caloric intake should be based upon the â€œRecommended Dietary Allowancesâ€?, 10th ed., Food and Nutrition Board, National Research Council, National Academy of Sciences, 1989.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">What is the most important information I should know about BUPHENYL?</span></p>
<p>BUPHENYL is prescribed along with changes in diet for long-term treatment of urea cycle disorders. BUPHENYL can only be obtained with a prescription from your doctor. </p>
<p>BUPHENYL must be taken exactly as the doctor prescribes; do not increase or decrease the dose of this medication without the doctor's approval.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What are urea cycle disorders?</span></p>
<p>Urea cycle disorders include a group of diseases, each having a specific liver enzyme deficiency. Because they are inherited, other family members may be affected. These disorders vary in severity and may be first detected at various ages, from newborn infants to adults. They lead to increased amounts of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184927" conceptname="Ammonia">ammonia</span> in the blood, which may cause disturbed brain function and severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4080670" conceptname="Brain damage">brain damage</span>. Typical signs of the disease are <span class="Bold">decreased mental awareness, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, combativeness, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196636" conceptname="Dysarthria">slurred speech</span>, unstable gait, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372448" conceptname="Loss of consciousness">unconsciousness</span>.</span>Â  The diagnosis of urea cycle disorders requires special laboratory tests. <span class="Bold">These typical signs of the disease may recur after the diagnosis is made if the condition is not under control. If they do, the doctor should be notified immediately because this is a medical emergency. An <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> can cause the condition to go out of control. Therefore, if a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span> develops, the doctor should be seen immediately. </span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">A patient or carrier of these disorders should wear a Medic Alert tag stating the diagnosis. In the event that the patient has a sudden, rapid accumulation of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184927" conceptname="Ammonia">ammonia</span> in the blood, and, therefore, in the brain, leading to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372448" conceptname="Loss of consciousness">unconsciousness</span>, the doctor will be alerted to treat the disease properly.</span></p>
<p>Periodically, depending upon the severity of a particular patient's urea cycle disorder, it will be necessary to perform blood tests. These include plasma <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184927" conceptname="Ammonia">ammonia</span>, plasma amino acid levels, and other more routine blood tests to evaluate nutritional status.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What is BUPHENYL?</span></p>
<p>BUPHENYL is a drug that helps to prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184927" conceptname="Ammonia">ammonia</span> from accumulating in the blood. BUPHENYL aids the body in eliminating substances that produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184927" conceptname="Ammonia">ammonia</span>. However, despite drug treatment, blood <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184927" conceptname="Ammonia">ammonia</span> levels may become elevated periodically and there may be episodes of altered brain function in association with these <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184927" conceptname="Ammonia">ammonia</span> elevations. Patients who have disease onset as newborns have a high incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440389" conceptname="Mental retardation">mental retardation</span>. Medical attention should be obtained as soon as signs appear (see above under "What are urea cycle disorders?"). BUPHENYL may be used as life-long therapy or as a temporary measure until liver transplantation is performed.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What diet should I or my child follow?</span></p>
<p>In addition to taking BUPHENYL, it is equally important that a prescribed diet be followed. Because there is great variability in the severity of urea cycle disorders, each patient's diet should be custom designed by a physician and a nutritionist. Because the diet is so important, it is recommended that the prescribed diet be discussed with a nutritionist who is familiar with urea cycle disorders. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Who should not take BUPHENYL?</span></p>
<p>BUPHENYL is prescribed only for patients with urea cycle disorders. It is not to be used for any other reason. Keep the medication in a safe place where children cannot reach it.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What other medical conditions may also be present that could increase the risk of taking BUPHENYL?</span></p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">Heart failure</span> or decreased kidney function may lead to retention of the sodium content of BUPHENYL with potentially serious consequences such as worsening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, high blood pressure, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span>. If these medical conditions are present, the doctor will determine if your child should take BUPHENYL.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">How should I or my child take BUPHENYL?</span></p>
<p>The dose of BUPHENYL prescribed for adults and children is based upon the patient's weight or size. It is very important that the full amount prescribed for any 24-hour period be taken. If a dose is missed it should be administered as soon as possible that same day. The total daily dose should be administered in equally divided amounts with meals.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What medications should I or my child avoid or be cautious of taking while on BUPHENYL?</span></p>
<p>Patients with urea cycle disorders usually should not take Depakene<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (valproic acid), a drug sometimes prescribed for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> disorders, or Haldol<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (haloperidol), a drug used to treat certain types of psychiatric or neurologic disorders. Both of these drugs have been reported to increase blood <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184927" conceptname="Ammonia">ammonia</span> levels. Steroids may break down body protein, thereby increasing blood <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184927" conceptname="Ammonia">ammonia</span> levels. The doctor should be consulted before administering medications containing steroids.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What medications may affect the way the body breaks down the drug?</span></p>
<p>Probenecid, a medication used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440674" conceptname="Gout">gout</span>, may affect the way the kidneys excrete BUPHENYL (consult the doctor for details).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What are the most common side effects of BUPHENYL?</span></p>
<p>The most common side effect reported in premenopausal women taking BUPHENYL was absent or irregular menstrual periods. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">Decreased appetite</span> was reported in 4% of all people treated. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4178504" conceptname="Body odor">Body odor</span> and bad taste were each reported in 3% of all patients treated.</p>
<p>A breakdown product of BUPHENYL has been associated mainly with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> and light-headedness. Because these symptoms may also be due to the urea cycle going out of control, a doctor should see the patient immediately if these symptoms occur, so the cause can be determined.Â Â  Blood tests should be performed periodically for adverse effects and for levels of medication and its breakdown products.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">How should BUPHENYL be stored?</span></p>
<p>BUPHENYL should be stored in a tightly closed bottle at room temperature.</p>
