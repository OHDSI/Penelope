<h2><span class="Underline">Oral Administration</span></h2>
<p class="First">Rifampin is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Peak serum concentrations in healthy adults and pediatric populations vary widely from individual to individual. Following a single 600 mg oral dose of rifampin in healthy adults, the peak serum concentration averages 7 mcg/mL but may vary from 4 to 32 mcg/mL. Absorption of rifampin is reduced by about 30% when the drug is ingested with food.</p>
<p>Rifampin is widely distributed throughout the body. It is present in effective concentrations in many organs and body fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid. Rifampin is about 80% protein bound. Most of the unbound fraction is not ionized and, therefore, diffuses freely into tissues.</p>
<p>In healthy adults, the mean biological half-life of rifampin in serum averages 3.35 ± 0.66 hours after a 600 mg oral dose, with increases up to 5.08 ± 2.45 hours reported after a 900 mg dose. With repeated administration, the half-life decreases and reaches average values of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The half-life does not differ in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> at doses not exceeding 600 mg daily, and consequently, no dosage adjustment is required. The half-life of rifampin at a dose of 720 mg daily has not been established in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span>.  Following a single 900 mg oral dose of rifampin in patients with varying degrees of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>, the mean half-life increased from 3.6 hours in healthy adults to 5.0, 7.3, and 11.0  hours in patients with glomerular filtration rates of 30 to 50 mL/min, less than 30 mL/min, and in anuric patients, respectively. Refer to the <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_warnings_id_s13">WARNINGS</a></span> section for information regarding patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic insufficiency</span>.</p>
<p>After absorption, rifampin is rapidly eliminated in the bile, and an enterohepatic circulation ensues. During this process, rifampin undergoes progressive deacetylation so that nearly all the drug in the bile is in this form in about 6 hours. This metabolite has antibacterial activity. Intestinal reabsorption is reduced by deacetylation, and elimination is facilitated. Up to 30% of a dose is excreted in the urine, with about half of this being unchanged drug.</p>

<h2>Pediatrics</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Underline">Oral Administration </span></span></p>
<p>In one study, pediatric patients 6 to 58 months old were given rifampin suspended in simple syrup or as dry powder mixed with applesauce at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight. Peak serum concentrations of 10.7 ± 3.7 and 11.5 ± 5.1 mcg/mL were obtained 1 hour after preprandial ingestion of the drug suspension and the applesauce mixture, respectively. After the administration of either preparation, the t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> of rifampin averaged 2.9 hours. It should be noted that in other studies in pediatric populations, at doses of 10 mg/kg body weight, mean peak serum concentrations of 3.5 mcg/mL to 15 mcg/mL have been reported.</p>

The agar proportion method (CDC or CLSI<span class="Sup">(1)</span> M24-A) utilizes Middlebrook 7H10 medium impregnated with rifampin at a final concentration of 1.0  mcg/mL to determine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4150981" conceptname="Drug resistance">drug resistance</span>. After three weeks of incubation MIC<span class="Sub">99</span> values are calculated by comparing the quantity of organisms growing in the medium containing drug to the control cultures.

<p>The radiometric broth method employs the BACTEC 460 machine to compare the growth index from untreated control cultures to cultures grown in the presence of 2.0 mcg/mL of rifampin. Strict adherence to the manufacturer's instructions for sample processing and data interpretation is required for this assay.</p>

<p>A report of "susceptible" indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited by usually achievable concentrations of the antimicrobial compound in the blood. A report of "intermediate" indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where the maximum acceptable dose of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone that prevents small-uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of "resistant" indicates that usually achievable concentrations of the antimicrobial compound in the blood are unlikely to be inhibitory and that other therapy should be selected.</p>
<p>Measurement of MIC or minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) and achieved antimicrobial compound concentrations may be appropriate to guide therapy in some <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span>.

<p class="First">In the treatment of both <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span> and the meningococcal carrier state, the small number of resistant cells present within large populations of susceptible cells can rapidly become the predominant type. Bacteriologic cultures should be obtained before the start of therapy to confirm the susceptibility of the organism to rifampin and they should be repeated throughout therapy to monitor the response to treatment. Since resistance can emerge rapidly, susceptibility tests should be performed in the event of persistent positive cultures during the course of treatment.

Fatalities associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span> have occurred in patients with liver disease and in patients taking rifampin with other hepatotoxic agents. Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4326594" conceptname="Abnormal liver function">impaired liver function</span> should be given rifampin only in cases of necessity and then with caution and under strict medical supervision. In these patients, careful monitoring of liver function, especially SGPT/ALT and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4094657" conceptname="Aspartate aminotransferase">SGOT</span>/AST should be carried out prior to therapy and then every 2 to 4 weeks during therapy. If signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">hepatocellular damage</span> occur, rifampin should be withdrawn.</p>
<p>In some cases, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4032334" conceptname="Hyperbilirubinemia">hyperbilirubinemia</span> resulting from competition between rifampin and bilirubin for excretory pathways of the liver at the cell level can occur in the early days of treatment. An isolated report showing a moderate rise in bilirubin and/or transaminase level is not in itself an indication for interrupting treatment; rather, the decision should be made after repeating the tests, noting trends in the levels, and considering them in conjunction with the patient's clinical condition.</p>
<p>Rifampin has enzyme-inducing properties, including induction of delta amino levulinic acid synthetase. Isolated reports have associated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4305376" conceptname="Porphyria">porphyria</span> exacerbation with rifampin administration.</p>
<p>The possibility of rapid emergence of resistant meningococci restricts the use of rifampin to short-term treatment of the asymptomatic carrier state. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Rifampin is not to be used for the treatment of meningococcal disease.</span></p>

<p>Prescribing rifampin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432545" conceptname="Bacterial infectious disease">bacterial infection</span> or a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118659" conceptname="Prophylactic">prophylactic</span> indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p>
<p>For the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span>, rifampin is usually administered on a daily basis. Doses of rifampin greater than 600 mg given once or twice weekly have resulted in a higher incidence of adverse reactions, including the "<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4266367" conceptname="Influenza">flu syndrome</span>" (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4190045" conceptname="Rigor">chills</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4272240" conceptname="Malaise">malaise</span>), hematopoietic reactions (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435224" conceptname="Leukopenia">leukopenia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435503" conceptname="Hemolytic anemia">acute hemolytic anemia</span>), cutaneous, gastrointestinal, and hepatic reactions, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">shortness of breath</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylaxis</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span>. Recent studies indicate that regimens using twice-weekly doses of rifampin 600 mg plus isoniazid 15 mg/kg are much better tolerated.</p>
<p>Rifampin is not recommended for intermittent therapy; the patient should be cautioned against intentional or accidental interruption of the daily dosage regimen since rare renal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span> have been reported when therapy was resumed in such cases.</p>
<p>Rifampin has enzyme induction properties that can enhance the metabolism of endogenous substrates including adrenal hormones, thyroid hormones, and vitamin D. Rifampin and isoniazid have been reported to alter vitamin D metabolism. In some cases, reduced levels of circulating 25-hydroxy vitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D have been accompanied by reduced serum calcium and phosphate, and elevated parathyroid hormone.</p>

<h2><span class="Underline">Information for Patients</span></h2>
<p class="First">Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including rifampin should only be used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432545" conceptname="Bacterial infectious disease">bacterial infections</span>. They do not treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440029" conceptname="Viral disease">viral infections</span> (e.g., the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">common cold</span>). When rifampin is prescribed to treat a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432545" conceptname="Bacterial infectious disease">bacterial infection</span>, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by rifampin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">The patient should be told that rifampin may produce a reddish coloration of the urine, sweat, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4102774" conceptname="Productive cough">sputum</span>, and tears, and the patient should be forewarned of this.</span> Soft contact lenses may be permanently stained. </p>
<p>The patient should be advised that the reliability of oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives may be affected; consideration should be given to using alternative contraceptive measures.</p>
<p>Patients should be instructed to take rifampin either 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal with a full glass of water.</p>
<p>Patients should be instructed to notify their physicians promptly if they experience any of the following: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, loss of appetite, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4272240" conceptname="Malaise">malaise</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, darkened urine, yellowish discoloration of the skin and eyes, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span> of the joints.</p>

<h2><span class="Underline">Laboratory Tests</span></h2>
<p class="First">Adults treated for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span> with rifampin should have baseline measurements of hepatic enzymes, bilirubin, serum creatinine, a complete blood count, and a platelet count (or estimate). Baseline tests are unnecessary in pediatric patients unless a complicating condition is known or clinically suspected.</p>
<p>Patients should be seen at least monthly during therapy and should be specifically questioned concerning symptoms associated with adverse reactions. All patients with abnormalities should have follow-up, including laboratory testing, if necessary. Routine laboratory monitoring for toxicity in people with normal baseline measurements is generally not necessary.</p>

<h2><span class="Underline">Drug Interactions</span></h2>
<p class="First">Healthy subjects who received rifampin 600 mg once daily concomitantly with saquinavir 1000 mg/ritonavir 100 mg twice daily (ritonavir-boosted saquinavir) developed severe hepatocellular toxicity. Therefore, concomitant use of these medications is contraindicated. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_contraindications_id_s12">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span>.)</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Enzyme Induction:</span> Rifampin is known to induce certain cytochrome P-450 enzymes. Administration of rifampin with drugs that undergo biotransformation through these metabolic pathways may accelerate elimination of coadministered drugs. To maintain optimum therapeutic blood levels, dosages of drugs metabolized by these enzymes may require adjustment when starting or stopping concomitantly administered rifampin. </p>
<p>Rifampin has been reported to substantially decrease the plasma concentrations of the following antiviral drugs: atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, saquinavir, and tipranavir. These antiviral drugs must not be co-administered with rifampin. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_contraindications_id_s12">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span>.)</p>
<p>Rifampin has been reported to accelerate the metabolism of the following drugs: anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin), digitoxin, antiarrhythmics (e.g., disopyramide, mexiletine, quinidine, tocainide), oral anticoagulants, antifungals (e.g., fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole), barbiturates, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers (e.g., diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil), chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, corticosteroids, cyclosporine, cardiac glycoside preparations, clofibrate, oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives, dapsone, diazepam, doxycycline, fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin), haloperidol, oral hypoglycemic agents (sulfonylureas), levothyroxine, methadone, narcotic analgesics, progestins, quinine, tacrolimus, theophylline, tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline, nortriptyline) and zidovudine. It may be necessary to adjust the dosages of these drugs if they are given concurrently with rifampin. </p>
<p>Patients using oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives should be advised to change to non-hormonal methods of birth control during rifampin therapy. </p>
<p>Rifampin has been observed to increase the requirements for anticoagulant drugs of the coumarin type. In patients receiving anticoagulants and rifampin concurrently, it is recommended that the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time be performed daily or as frequently as necessary to establish and maintain the required dose of anticoagulant.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Other Interactions:</span> When the two drugs were taken concomitantly, decreased concentrations of atovaquone and increased concentrations of rifampin were observed.</p>
<p>Concurrent use of ketoconazole and rifampin has resulted in decreased serum concentrations of both drugs. Concurrent use of rifampin and enalapril has resulted in decreased concentrations of enalaprilat, the active metabolite of enalapril. Dosage adjustments should be made if indicated by the patient's clinical condition.</p>
<p>Concomitant antacid administration may reduce the absorption of rifampin. Daily doses of rifampin should be given at least 1 hour before the ingestion of antacids.</p>
<p>Probenecid and cotrimoxazole have been reported to increase the blood level of rifampin.</p>
<p>When rifampin is given concomitantly with either halothane or isoniazid, the potential for hepatotoxicity is increased. The concomitant use of rifampin and halothane should be avoided. Patients receiving both rifampin and isoniazid should be monitored close for hepatotoxicity.</p>
<p>Plasma concentrations of sulfapyridine may be reduced following the concomitant administration of sulfasalazine and rifampin. This finding may be the result of alteration in the colonic bacteria responsible for the reduction of sulfasalazine to sulfapyridine and mesalamine.</p>

<h2><span class="Underline">Drug/Laboratory Interactions</span></h2>
<p class="First">Cross-reactivity and false-positive urine screening tests for opiates have been reported in patients receiving rifampin when using the KIMS (Kinetic Interaction of Microparticles in Solution) method (e.g., Abuscreen OnLine opiates assay; Roche Diagnostic Systems). Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> spectrometry, will distinguish rifampin from opiates.</p>
<p>Therapeutic levels of rifampin have been shown to inhibit standard microbiological assays for serum folate and vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span>. Thus, alternate assay methods should be considered. Transient abnormalities in liver function tests (e.g., elevation in serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and serum transaminases) and reduced biliary excretion of contrast media used for visualization of the gallbladder have also been observed. Therefore, these tests should be performed before the morning dose of rifampin.</p>

<p>Rifampin is indicated in the treatment of all forms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span>. A three-drug regimen consisting of rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide [e.g., RIFATER<span class="Sup">®</span>]<span class="Sup">5</span> is recommended in the initial phase of short-course therapy which is usually continued for 2 months. The Advisory Council for the Elimination of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">Tuberculosis</span>, the American Thoracic Society, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that either streptomycin or ethambutol be added as a fourth drug in a regimen containing isoniazid (INH), rifampin and pyrazinamide for initial treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span> unless the likelihood of INH resistance is very low.

<p>Following the initial phase, treatment should be continued with rifampin and isoniazid [RIFAMATE<span class="Sup">®</span>]<span class="Sup">6</span>. for at least 4 months.

<h2><span class="Underline">Preparation of Extemporaneous Oral Suspension</span></h2>
<p class="First">For pediatric and adult patients in whom capsule swallowing is difficult or where lower doses are needed, a liquid suspension may be prepared as follows: </p>
<p>Rifampin 1% w/v suspension (10 mg/mL) can be compounded using Simple Syrup (Syrup NF): </p>
<dl>
<dt>1.</dt>
<dd>Empty the contents of four Rifampin 300 mg capsules or eight Rifampin 150 mg capsules onto a piece of weighing paper. </dd>
<dt>2.</dt>
<dd>If necessary, gently crush the capsule contents with a spatula to produce a fine powder. </dd>
<dt>3.</dt>
<dd>Transfer the rifampin powder blend to a 4-ounce amber glass or plastic (high density polyethylene [HDPE], polypropylene, or polycarbonate) prescription bottle. </dd>
<dt>4.</dt>
<dd>Rinse the paper and spatula with 20 mL of syrup, and add the rinse to the bottle. Shake vigorously.</dd>
<dt>5.</dt>
<dd>Add 100 mL of syrup to the bottle and shake vigorously.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This compounding procedure results in a 1% w/v suspension containing 10 mg rifampin/mL. Stability studies indicate that the suspension is stable when stored at room temperature (25 ± 3°C) or in a refrigerator (2-8°C) for four weeks. This extemporaneously prepared suspension must be shaken well prior to administration.</p>
