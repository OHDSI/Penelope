<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets contain medroxyprogesterone acetate, which is a derivative of progesterone. It is a white to off-white, odorless crystalline powder, stable in air, melting between 200 and 210It is freely soluble in chloroform, soluble in acetone and in dioxane, sparingly soluble in alcohol and in methanol, slightly soluble in ether, and insoluble in water.<br>The chemical name for medroxyprogesterone acetate is pregn-4-ene-3, 20-dione, 17-(acetyloxy)-6-methyl-, (6The structural formula is:<br><div class="Figure"><img alt="MM1" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=468a972c-cb14-47c3-bdf6-4f7b64509e5c&amp;name=MM1.jpg"></div>
<br><br>Each medroxyprogesterone acetate tablet for oral administration contains 2.5 mg, 5 mg or 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate and the following inactive ingredients: calcium stearate, corn starch, lactose, mineral oil, sorbic acid, sucrose, and talc. The 2.5 mg tablet contains FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6.<br><br>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) administered orally or parenterally in the recommended doses to women with adequate endogenous estrogen, transforms proliferative into secretory endometrium. Androgenic and anabolic effects have been noted, but the drug is apparently devoid of significant estrogenic activity. While parenterally administered MPA inhibits gonadotropin production, which in turn prevents follicular maturation and ovulation, available data indicate that this does not occur when the usually recommended oral dosage is given as single daily doses.<br><br>

<h1>PHARMACOKINETICS</h1>The pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined in 20 postmenopausal women following a single-dose administration of eight MPA 2.5 mg tablets or a single administration of two MPA 10 mg tablets under fasting conditions. In another study, the steady-state pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined under fasting conditions in 30 postmenopausal women following daily administration of one MPA 10 mg tablet for 7 days. In both studies, MPA was quantified in serum using a validated gas chromatography-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> spectrometry (GC-MS) method.

Malignant neoplasms<br></span><br><span class="Bold">a. Breast cancer<br></span>The use of estrogens and progestins by postmenopausal women has been reported to increase the risk of breast cancer in some studies. Observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller increased risk for estrogen alone therapy, after several years of use. The risk increased with duration of use and appeared to return to baseline in about 5 years after stopping treatment (only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping). Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogens or among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration.<br>The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about this issue is the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) substudy of daily conjugated estrogens (CE 0.625 mg) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA 2.5 mg). (See<span class="Underline">CLINICAL STUDIES</span>.)<br>In the estrogen plus progestin substudy of WHI, after a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the WHI substudy reported an increased risk of breast cancer in women who took daily CE/MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24 (95 percent nominal confidence interval [nCI], 1.011.54), and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for estrogen plus progestin compared with placebo, respectively. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE/MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years, for estrogen plus progestin compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger and diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE/MPA group compared with the placebo group. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4116496" conceptname="Disseminated adenocarcinoma">Metastatic disease</span> was rare with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors such as histologic subtype, grade, and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups.<br>The use of estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a health care provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.<br><br><span class="Bold">b. Endometrial cancer<br></span>An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in women with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2- to 12 times greater than in nonusers, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued.<br>Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen plus progestin therapy is important.
