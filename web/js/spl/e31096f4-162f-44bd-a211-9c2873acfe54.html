<h1><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span></h1>
<p class="First">Pharmacologically, Butalbital, Aspirin, and Caffeine Capsules, USP combines the analgesic properties of aspirin with the anxiolytic and muscle relaxant properties of butalbital.</p>
<p>The clinical effectiveness of Butalbital, Aspirin, and Caffeine Capsules, USPÂ in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="376382" conceptname="Tension-type headache">tension headache</span> has been established in double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-clinic trials. A factorial design study compared Butalbital, Aspirin, and Caffeine Capsules, USPÂ with each of its major components. This study demonstrated that each component contributes to the efficacy of Butalbital, Aspirin, and Caffeine Capsules, USPÂ in the treatment of the target symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="376382" conceptname="Tension-type headache">tension headache</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, psychic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4200706" conceptname="Tension">tension</span>, and muscle contraction in the head, neck, and shoulder region). For each symptom and the symptom complex as a whole, Butalbital, Aspirin, and Caffeine Capsules, USPÂ was shown to have significantly superior clinical effects to either component alone.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span></h2>
<p class="First">The behavior of the individual components is described below.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Aspirin<br></span></span>The systemic availability of aspirin after an oral dose is highly dependent on the dosage form, the presence of food, the gastric emptying time, gastric pH, antacids, buffering agents, and particle size. These factors affect not necessarily the extent of absorption of total salicylates but more the stability of aspirin prior to absorption.</p>
<p>During the absorption process and after absorption, aspirin is mainly hydrolyzed to salicylic acid and distributed to all body tissues and fluids, including fetal tissues, breast milk, and the central nervous system (CNS). Highest concentrations are found in plasma, liver, renal cortex, heart, and lung. In plasma, about 50%-80% of the salicylic acid and its metabolites are loosely bound to plasma proteins.</p>
<p>The clearance of total salicylates is subject to saturable kinetics; however, first-order elimination kinetics are still a good approximation for doses up to 650 mg. The plasma half-life for aspirin is about 12 minutes and for salicylic acid and/or total salicylates is about 3 hours.</p>
<p>The elimination of therapeutic doses is through the kidneys either as salicylic acid or other biotransformation products. The renal clearance is greatly augmented by an alkaline urine as is produced by concurrent administration of sodium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span> or potassium citrate.</p>
<p>The biotransformation of aspirin occurs primarily in the hepatocytes. The major metabolites are salicyluric acid (75%), the phenolic and acyl glucuronides of salicylate (15%), and gentisic and gentisuric acid (1%). The bioavailability of the aspirin component of Butalbital, Aspirin, and Caffeine Capsules, USP is equivalent to that of a solution except for a slower rate of absorption. A peak concentration of 8.8 mcg/mL was obtained at 40 minutes after a 650 mg dose.</p>
<p>See <span class="Italics"><a href="#LINK_73d138c7-b306-4d49-b348-47685879ed07">OVERDOSAGE</a></span> for toxicity information.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Butalbital<br></span></span>Butalbital is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is expected to distribute to most of the tissues in the body. Barbiturates, in general, may appear in breast milk and readily cross the placental barrier. They are bound to plasma and tissue proteins to a varying degree and binding increases directly as a function of lipid solubility.</p>
<p>Elimination of butalbital is primarily via the kidney (59%-88% of the dose) as unchanged drug or metabolites. The plasma half-life is about 35 hours. Urinary excretion products included parent drug (about 3.6% of the dose), 5-isobutyl-5-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl) barbituric acid (about 24% of the dose), 5-allyl-5(3-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-propyl) barbituric acid (about 4.8% of the dose), products with the barbituric acid ring hydrolyzed with excretion of urea (about 14% of the dose), as well as unidentified materials. Of the material excreted in the urine, 32% was conjugated.</p>
<p>The bioavailability of the butalbital component of Butalbital, Aspirin, and Caffeine Capsules, USP is equivalent to that of a solution except for a decrease in the rate of absorption. A peak concentration of 2,020 ng/mL is obtained at about 1.5 hours after a 100 mg dose.</p>
<p>The <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>plasma protein binding of butalbital is 45% over the concentration range of 0.5-20 mcg/mL. This <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falls</span> within the range of plasma protein binding (20%-45%) reported with other barbiturates such as phenobarbital, pentobarbital, and secobarbital sodium. The plasma-to-blood concentration ratio was almost unity indicating that there is no preferential distribution of butalbital into either plasma or blood cells.</p>
<p>See <span class="Italics"><a href="#LINK_73d138c7-b306-4d49-b348-47685879ed07">OVERDOSAGE</a></span> for toxicity information.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Caffeine<br></span></span>Like most xanthines, caffeine is rapidly absorbed and distributed in all body tissues and fluids, including the CNS, fetal tissues, and breast milk.</p>
<p>Caffeine is cleared rapidly through metabolism and excretion in the urine. The plasma half-life is about 3 hours. Hepatic biotransformation prior to excretion results in about equal amounts of 1-methylxanthine and 1-methyluric acid. Of the 70% of the dose that has been recovered in the urine, only 3% was unchanged drug.</p>
<p>The bioavailability of the caffeine component for Butalbital, Aspirin, and Caffeine Capsules, USP is equivalent to that of a solution except for a slightly longer time to peak. A peak concentration of 1,660 ng/mL was obtained in less than an hour for an 80 mg dose.</p>

<p class="First">Aspirin, caffeine, and barbiturates are excreted in breast milk in small amounts, but the significance of their effects on nursing infants is not known. Because of potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Butalbital, Aspirin, and Caffeine Capsules, USP, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

The average daily dose for the barbiturate addict is usually about 1,500 mg. As tolerance to barbiturates develops, the amount needed to maintain the same level of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> increases; tolerance to a fatal dosage, however, does not increase more than two-fold. As this occurs, the margin between an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> dosage and fatal dosage becomes smaller. The lethal dose of a barbiturate is far less if alcohol is also ingested. Major withdrawal symptoms (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373995" conceptname="Delirium">delirium</span>) may occur within 16 hours and last up to 5 days after abrupt cessation of these drugs. Intensity of withdrawal symptoms gradually declines over a period of approximately 15 days. Treatment of barbiturate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> consists of cautious and gradual withdrawal of the drug. Barbiturate-dependent patients can be withdrawn by using a number of different withdrawal regimens. One method involves initiating treatment at the patientâ€™s regular dosage level and gradually decreasing the daily dosage as tolerated by the patient.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span></h1>
