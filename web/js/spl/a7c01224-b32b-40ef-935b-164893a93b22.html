<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Aminophylline is a 2:1 complex of theophylline and ethylenediamine. Theophylline is structurally classified as a methylxanthine. Aminophylline occurs as a white or slightly yellowish granule or powder, with a slight ammoniacal odor. Aminophylline has the chemical name 1H-Purine-2,6-dione,3,7-dihydro-1,3-dimethyl-, compound with 1,2-ethanediamine (2:1) and is represented by the following structural formula:</p>

<h2>Mechanism of Action:</h2>
<p class="First">Theophylline has two distinct actions in the airways of patients with reversible obstruction; smooth <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">muscle relaxation</span> (i.e., bronchodilation) and suppression of the response of the airways to stimuli (i.e., non-bronchodilator <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118659" conceptname="Prophylactic">prophylactic</span> effects). While the mechanisms of action of theophylline are not known with certainty, studies in animals suggest that bronchodilatation is mediated by the inhibition of two isozymes of phosphodiesterase (PDE III and, to a lesser extent, PDE IV) while non-bronchodilator <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118659" conceptname="Prophylactic">prophylactic</span> actions are probably mediated through one or more different molecular mechanisms, that do not involve inhibition of PDE III or antagonism of adenosine receptors. Some of the adverse effects associated with theophylline appear to be mediated by inhibition of PDE III (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span>) and adenosine receptor antagonism (e.g., alterations in cerebral blood flow).</p>
<p>Theophylline increases the force of contraction of diaphragmatic muscles. This action appears to be due to enhancement of calcium uptake through an adenosine-mediated channel.</p>

<h2>Serum Concentration-Effect Relationship:</h2>
<p class="First">Bronchodilation occurs over the serum theophylline concentration range of 5-20 mcg/mL. Clinically important improvement in symptom control has been found in most studies to require peak serum theophylline concentrations &gt;10 mcg/mL, but patients with mild disease may benefit from lower concentrations. At serum theophylline concentrations &gt;20 mcg/mL, both the frequency and severity of adverse reactions increase. In general, maintaining peak serum theophylline concentrations between 10 and 15 mcg/mL will achieve most of the drugâ€™s potential therapeutic benefit while minimizing the risk of serious adverse events.</p>

<a name="section-3.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Pharmacokinetics:</h2>
<p class="First">OverviewTheophylline is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration in solution or immediate-release solid oral dosage form. Theophylline does not undergo any appreciable pre-systemic elimination, distributes freely into fat-free tissues and is extensively metabolized in the liver.</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of theophylline vary widely among similar patients and cannot be predicted by age, sex, body weight or other demographic characteristics. In addition, certain concurrent illnesses and alterations in normal physiology (see Table I) and co-administration of other drugs (see Table II) can significantly alter the pharmacokinetic characteristics of theophylline. Within-subject variability in metabolism has also been reported in some studies, especially in acutely ill patients. It is, therefore, recommended that serum theophylline concentrations be measured frequently in acutely ill patients (e.g., at 24-hr intervals) and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy, e.g., at 6-12 month intervals. More frequent measurements should be made in the presence of any condition that may significantly alter theophylline clearance (see <a href="#A45FA899-5688-4104-A1C0-DA0ACE031E68">PRECAUTIONS</a>, <a href="#A438CE86-4768-45C6-80DC-FB17E9B064E2">Laboratory tests</a>).</p>

<p>Note<span class="Bold">: </span>In addition to the factors listed above, theophylline clearance is increased and half-life decreased by low carbohydrate/high protein diets, parenteral nutrition, and daily consumption of charcoal-broiled beef. A high carbohydrate/low protein diet can decrease the clearance and prolong the half-life of theophylline.</p>
<p>AbsorptionTheophylline is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration in solution or immediate-release solid oral dosage form. After a single dose of 5 mg/kg in adults, a mean peak serum concentration of about 10 mcg/mL (range 5-15 mcg/mL) can be expected 1-2 hr after the dose. Co-administration of theophylline with food or antacids does not cause clinically significant changes in the absorption of theophylline from immediate-release dosage forms.</p>
<p>DistributionOnce theophylline enters the systemic circulation, about 40% is bound to plasma protein, primarily albumin. Unbound theophylline distributes throughout body water, but distributes poorly into body fat. The apparent volume of distribution of theophylline is approximately 0.45 L/kg (range 0.3-0.7 L/kg) based on ideal body weight. Theophylline passes freely across the placenta, into breast milk and into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Saliva theophylline concentrations approximate unbound serum concentrations, but are not reliable for routine or therapeutic monitoring unless special techniques are used. An increase in the volume of distribution of theophylline, primarily due to reduction in plasma protein binding, occurs in premature neonates, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4064161" conceptname="Cirrhosis of liver">hepatic cirrhosis</span>, uncorrected <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidemia</span>, the elderly and in women during the third trimester of pregnancy. In such cases, the patient may show signs of toxicity at total (bound + unbound) serum concentrations of theophylline in the therapeutic range (10-20 mcg/mL) due to elevated concentrations of the pharmacologically active unbound drug. Similarly, a patient with decreased theophylline binding may have a sub-therapeutic total drug concentration while the pharmacologically active unbound concentration is in the therapeutic range. If only total serum theophylline concentration is measured, this may lead to an unnecessary and potentially dangerous dose increase. In patients with reduced protein binding, measurement of unbound serum theophylline concentration provides a more reliable means of dosage adjustment than measurement of total serum theophylline concentration. Generally, concentrations of unbound theophylline should be maintained in the range of 6-12 mcg/mL.</p>
<p>Metabolism Following oral dosing, theophylline does not undergo any measurable first-pass elimination. In adults and children beyond one year of age, approximately 90% of the dose is metabolized in the liver. Biotransformation takes place through demethylation to 1-methylxanthine and 3-methylxanthine and hydroxylation to 1,3-dimethyluric acid. 1-methylxanthine is further hydroxylated, by xanthine oxidase, to 1-methyluric acid. About 6% of a theophylline dose is N-methylated to caffeine. Theophylline demethylation to 3-methylxanthine is catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 1A2, while cytochromes P-450 2E1 and P-450 3A3 catalyze the hydroxylation to 1,3-dimethyluric acid. Demethylation to 1-methylxanthine appears to be catalyzed either by cytochrome P-450 1A2 or a closely related cytochrome. In neonates, the N-demethylation pathway is absent while the function of the hydroxylation pathway is markedly deficient. The activity of these pathways slowly increases to maximal levels by one year of age.</p>
<p>Caffeine and 3-methylxanthine are the only theophylline metabolites with pharmacologic activity. 3-methylxanthine has approximately one tenth the pharmacologic activity of theophylline and serum concentrations in adults with normal renal function are &lt;1 mcg/mL. In patients with end-stage <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>, 3-methylxanthine may accumulate to concentrations that approximate the unmetabolized theophylline concentration. Caffeine concentrations are usually undetectable in adults regardless of renal function. In neonates, caffeine may accumulate to concentrations that approximate the unmetabolized theophylline concentration and thus, exert a pharmacologic effect.</p>
<p>Both the N-demethylation and hydroxylation pathways of theophylline biotransformation are capacity-limited. Due to the wide intersubject variability of the rate of theophylline metabolism, non-linearity of elimination may begin in some patients at serum theophylline concentrations &lt;10 mcg/mL. Since this non-linearity results in more than proportional changes in serum theophylline concentrations with changes in dose, it is advisable to make increases or decreases in dose in small increments in order to achieve desired changes in serum theophylline concentrations (see <a href="#A2D6DC10-A033-4FFD-B9B6-D90E0175827A">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>, <a href="#A32876EF-86DB-4E57-80A1-C723266182E1">Table VI</a>). Accurate prediction of dose-dependency of theophylline metabolism in patients <span class="Italics">a priori </span>is not possible, but patients with very high initial clearance rates (i.e., low steady state serum theophylline concentrations at above average doses) have the greatest likelihood of experiencing large changes in serum theophylline concentration in response to dosage changes.</p>
<p>ExcretionIn neonates, approximately 50% of the theophylline dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Beyond the first three months of life, approximately 10% of the theophylline dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. The remainder is excreted in the urine mainly as 1,3-dimethyluric acid (35-40%), 1-methyluric acid (20-25%) and 3-methylxanthine (15-20%). Since little theophylline is excreted unchanged in the urine and since active metabolites of theophylline (i.e., caffeine, 3-methylxanthine) do not accumulate to clinically significant levels even in the face of end-stage <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>, no dosage adjustment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> is necessary in adults and children &gt;3 months of age. In contrast, the large fraction of the theophylline dose excreted in the urine as unchanged theophylline and caffeine in neonates requires careful attention to dose reduction and frequent monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations in neonates with reduced renal function (See <a href="#A3125938-25AC-43D7-A633-0E6438581574">WARNINGS</a>).</p>
<p>Serum Concentrations at Steady StateAfter multiple doses of theophylline, steady state is reached in 30-65 hours (average 40 hours) in adults. At steady state, on a dosage regimen with 6-hour intervals, the expected mean trough concentration is approximately 60% of the mean peak concentration, assuming a mean theophylline half-life of 8 hours. The difference between peak and trough concentrations is larger in patients with more rapid theophylline clearance. In patients with high theophylline clearance and half-lives of about 4-5 hours, such as children age 1 to 9 years, the trough serum theophylline concentration may be only 30% of peak with a 6-hour dosing interval. In these patients a slow release formulation would allow a longer dosing interval (8-12 hours) with a smaller peak/trough difference.</p>
<p>Special Populations (See Table I for mean clearance and half-life values)</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Geriatric</span> The clearance of theophylline is decreased by an average of 30% in healthy elderly adults (&gt;60 yrs) compared to healthy young adults. Careful attention to dose reduction and frequent monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations are required in elderly patients (see <a href="#A3125938-25AC-43D7-A633-0E6438581574">WARNINGS</a>).</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Pediatrics</span> The clearance of theophylline is very low in neonates (see <a href="#A3125938-25AC-43D7-A633-0E6438581574">WARNINGS</a>). Theophylline clearance reaches maximal values by one year of age, remains relatively constant until about 9 years of age and then slowly decreases by approximately 50% to adult values at about age 16. Renal excretion of unchanged theophylline in neonates amounts to about 50% of the dose, compared to about 10% in children older than three months and in adults. Careful attention to dosage selection and monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations are required in pediatric patients (see <a href="#A3125938-25AC-43D7-A633-0E6438581574">WARNINGS</a> and <a href="#A2D6DC10-A033-4FFD-B9B6-D90E0175827A">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Gender</span> Gender differences in theophylline clearance are relatively small and unlikely to be of clinical significance. Significant reduction in theophylline clearance, however, has been reported in women on the 20th day of the menstrual cycle and during the third trimester of pregnancy.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Race</span> Pharmacokinetic differences in theophylline clearance due to race have not been studied.</p>

<p><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">Congestive heart failure</span> (CHF)</span> Theophylline clearance is decreased by 50% or more in patients with CHF. The extent of reduction in theophylline clearance in patients with CHF appears to be directly correlated to the severity of the cardiac disease. Since theophylline clearance is independent of liver blood flow, the reduction in clearance appears to be due to impaired hepatocyte function rather than reduced perfusion. Careful attention to dose reduction and frequent monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations are required in patients with CHF (see <a href="#A3125938-25AC-43D7-A633-0E6438581574">WARNINGS</a>).</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Smokers</span> Tobacco and marijuana smoking appears to increase the clearance of theophylline by induction of metabolic pathways. Theophylline clearance has been shown to increase by approximately 50% in young adult tobacco smokers and by approximately 80% in elderly tobacco smokers compared to non-smoking subjects. Passive smoke exposure has also been shown to increase theophylline clearance by up to 50%. Abstinence from tobacco smoking for one week causes a reduction of approximately 40% in theophylline clearance. Careful attention to dose reduction and frequent monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations are required in patients who stop smoking (see <a href="#A3125938-25AC-43D7-A633-0E6438581574">WARNINGS</a>). Use of nicotine gum has been shown to have no effect on theophylline clearance.</p>

<h2>When Signs or Symptoms of Theophylline Toxicity Are Present:</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold Underline">Whenever a patient receiving theophylline develops <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, particularly repetitive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, or other signs or symptoms consistent with theophylline toxicity</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold Underline">(even if another cause may be suspected), additional doses of theophylline should be withheld and a serum theophylline concentration measured immediately.</span>Patients</p>
<p>should be instructed not to continue any dosage that causes adverse effects and to withhold subsequent doses until the symptoms have resolved, at which time the clinician may instruct the patient to resume the drug at a lower dosage (see <a href="#A2D6DC10-A033-4FFD-B9B6-D90E0175827A">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>, <a href="#A32876EF-86DB-4E57-80A1-C723266182E1">Dosing Guidelines, Table VI</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-7.4"></a><p></p>
<h2>Dosage Increases:</h2>
<p class="First">Increases in the dose of theophylline should not be made in response to an acute exacerbation of symptoms of chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="257907" conceptname="Disorder of lung">lung disease</span> since theophylline provides little added benefit to inhaled beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-selective agonists and systemically administered corticosteroids in this circumstance and increases the risk of adverse effects. A <span class="Underline">peak</span> steady-state serum theophylline concentration should be measured before increasing the dose in response to persistent chronic symptoms to ascertain whether an increase in dose is safe. Before increasing the theophylline dose on the basis of a low serum concentration, the clinician should consider whether the blood sample was obtained at an appropriate time in relationship to the dose and whether the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen (see <a href="#A45FA899-5688-4104-A1C0-DA0ACE031E68">PRECAUTIONS</a>, <a href="#A438CE86-4768-45C6-80DC-FB17E9B064E2">Laboratory Tests</a>).</p>
<p>As the rate of theophylline clearance may be dose-dependent (i.e., steady-state serum concentrations may increase disproportionately to the increase in dose), an increase in dose based upon a sub-therapeutic serum concentration measurement should be conservative. In general, limiting dose increases to about 25% of the previous total daily dose will reduce the risk of unintended excessive increases in serum theophylline concentration (see <a href="#A2D6DC10-A033-4FFD-B9B6-D90E0175827A">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>, <a href="#A32876EF-86DB-4E57-80A1-C723266182E1">Table VI</a>).</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34072-9">
<a name="section-8.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Careful consideration of the various interacting drugs and physiologic conditions that can alter theophylline clearance and require dosage adjustment should occur prior to initiation of theophylline therapy, prior to increases in theophylline dose, and during follow up (see WARNINGS). The dose of theophylline selected for initiation of therapy should be low and, <span class="Bold Italics">if tolerated</span>, increased slowly over a period of a week or longer with the final dose guided by monitoring serum theophylline concentrations and the patientâ€™s clinical response (see <a href="#A2D6DC10-A033-4FFD-B9B6-D90E0175827A">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>, <a href="#AE68EE70-F2B8-4C5F-A32F-DBFFD19CCF0B">Table V</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-8.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Monitoring Serum Theophylline Concentrations:</h2>
<p class="First">Serum theophylline concentration measurements are readily available and should be used to determine whether the dosage is appropriate. Specifically, the serum theophylline concentration should be measured as follows:</p>
<p>1. When initiating therapy to guide final dosage adjustment after titration.</p>
<p>2. Before making a dose increase to determine whether the serum concentration is sub</p>
<p>therapeutic in a patient who continues to be symptomatic.</p>
<p>3. Whenever signs or symptoms of theophylline toxicity are present.</p>
<p>4. Whenever there is a new illness, worsening of a chronic illness or a change in the patientâ€™s</p>
<p>treatment regimen that may alter theophylline clearance (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span> &gt;102ÂºF sustained for â‰¥24 hours, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span>, or drugs listed in Table II are added or discontinued).</p>
<p>To guide a dose increase, the blood sample should be obtained at the time of the expected peak serum theophylline concentration; 1-2 hours after a dose at steady-state.</p>
<p>For most patients, steady-state will be reached after 3 days of dosing when no doses have been missed, no extra doses have been added, and none of the doses have been taken at unequal intervals. A trough concentration (i.e., at the end of the dosing interval) provides no additional useful information and may lead to an inappropriate dose increase since the peak serum theophylline concentration can be two or more times greater than the trough concentration with an immediate-release formulation. If the serum sample is drawn more than two hours after the dose, the results must be interpreted with caution since the concentration may not be reflective of the peak concentration. In contrast, when signs or symptoms of theophylline toxicity are present, the serum sample should be obtained as soon as possible, analyzed immediately, and the result</p>
<p>reported to the clinician without delay. In patients in whom decreased serum protein binding is suspected (e.g., cirrhosis, women during the third trimester of pregnancy), the concentration of unbound theophylline should be measured and the dosage adjusted to achieve an unbound concentration of 6-12 mcg/mL.</p>
<p>Saliva concentrations of theophylline cannot be used reliably to adjust dosage without special techniques.</p>

<h2>Effects on Laboratory Tests:</h2>
<p class="First">As a result of its pharmacological effects, theophylline at serum concentrations within the 10-20 mcg/mL range modestly increases plasma glucose (from a mean of 88 mg% to 98 mg%), uric acid (from a mean of 4 mg/dL to 6 mg/dL), free fatty acids (from a mean of 451 Î¼Îµq/l to 800 Î¼Îµq/l, total <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> (from a mean of 140 to 160 mg/dL), HDL (from a mean of 36 to 50 mg/dL), HDL/LDL ratio (from a mean of 0.5 to 0.7), and urinary free cortisol excretion (from a mean of 44 to 63 mcg/24 hr). Theophylline at serum concentrations within the 10-20 mcg/mL range may also transiently decrease serum concentrations of triiodothyronine (144 before, 131 after one week and 142 ng/dL after 4 weeks of theophylline). The clinical importance of these changes should be weighed against the potential therapeutic benefit of theophylline in individual patients.</p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34076-0">

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">The patient (or parent/care giver) should be instructed to seek medical advice whenever <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, persistent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> or rapid heart beat occurs during treatment with theophylline, even if another cause is suspected.

Patients should be instructed to inform all clinicians involved in their care that they are taking theophylline, especially when a medication is being added or deleted from their treatment. Patients should be instructed to not alter the dose, timing of the dose, or frequency of administration without first consulting their clinician. If a dose is missed, the patient should be instructed to take the next dose at the usually scheduled time and to not attempt to make up for the missed dose.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Theophylline interacts with a wide variety of drugs. The interaction may be pharmacodynamic, i.e., alterations in the therapeutic response to theophylline or another drug or occurrence of adverse effects without a change in serum theophylline concentration. More frequently, however, the interaction is pharmacokinetic, i.e., the rate of theophylline clearance is altered by another drug resulting in increased or decreased serum theophylline concentrations. Theophylline only rarely alters the pharmacokinetics of other drugs.</p>
<p>The drugs listed in Table II have the potential to produce clinically significant pharmacodynamic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interactions</span> with theophylline. The information in the â€œEffectâ€? column of Table II assumes that the interacting drug is being added to a steady-state theophylline regimen. If theophylline is being initiated in a patient who is already taking a drug that inhibits theophylline clearance (e.g., cimetidine, erythromycin), the dose of theophylline required to achieve a therapeutic serum theophylline concentration will be smaller. Conversely, if theophylline is being initiated in a patient who is already taking a drug that enhances theophylline clearance (e.g., rifampin), the dose of theophylline required to achieve a therapeutic serum theophylline concentration will be larger. Discontinuation of a concomitant drug that increases theophylline clearance will result in accumulation of theophylline to potentially toxic levels, unless the theophylline dose is appropriately reduced. Discontinuation of a concomitant drug that inhibits theophylline clearance will result in decreased serum theophylline concentrations, unless the theophylline dose is appropriately increased.</p>
<p>The drugs listed in Table III have either been documented not to interact with theophylline or do not produce a clinically significant interaction (i.e., &lt;15% change in theophylline clearance).</p>
<p>The listing of drugs in Tables II and III are current as of January 2, 1996. New interactions are continuously being reported for theophylline, especially with new chemical entities. <span class="Bold Underline">The clinician should not assume that a drug does not interact with theophylline if it is not listed in Table II</span><span class="Bold">. </span>Before addition of a newly available drug in a patient receiving theophylline, the package insert of the new drug and/or the medical literature should be consulted to determine if an interaction between the new drug and theophylline has been reported.</p>

<p>The Effect of Other Drugs on Theophylline Serum Concentration Measurements:Most serum theophylline assays in clinical use are immunoassays which are specific for</p>
<p>theophylline. Other xanthines such as caffeine, dyphylline, and pentoxifylline are not detected by these assays. Some drugs (e.g.,cefazolin, cephalothin), however, may interfere</p>
<p>with certain HPLC techniques. Caffeine and xanthine metabolites in neonates or patients with renal dysfunction may cause the reading from some dry reagent office methods to be higher than the actual serum theophylline concentration.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Long term carcinogenicity studies have been carried out in mice (oral doses 30-150 mg/kg)and rats (oral doses 5-75 mg/kg). Results are pending.</p>
<p>Theophylline has been studied in Ames <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">salmonella</span>, <span class="Italics">in vivo </span>and <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>cytogenetics, micronucleus and Chinese hamster ovary test systems and has not been shown to be genotoxic.</p>
<p>In a 14 week continuous breeding study, theophylline, administered to mating pairs of B6C3F<span class="Sub">1</span> mice at oral doses of 120, 270 and 500 mg/kg (approximately 1<span class="Bold">.</span>0-3<span class="Bold">.</span>0 times the human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) impaired fertility, as evidenced by decreases in the number of live pups per litter, decreases in the mean number of litters per fertile pair, and increases in the gestation period at the high dose as well as decreases in the proportion of pups born alive at the mid and high dose. In 13 week toxicity studies, theophylline was administered to F344 rats and B6C3F<span class="Sub">1</span> mice at oral doses of 40-300 mg/kg (approximately 2.0 times the human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). At the high dose, systemic toxicity was observed in both species including decreases in testicular weight.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42228-7">
<a name="section-8.7"></a><p></p>
<h2>Pregnancy</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold Underline">Category C: </span>There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Additionally, there are no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> studies in non-rodents (e.g., rabbits). Theophylline was not shown to be teratogenic in CD-1 mice at oral doses up to 400 mg/kg, approximately 2.0 times the human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis or in CD-1 rats at oral doses up to 260 mg/kg, approximately 3.0 times the recommended human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. At a dose of 220 mg/kg, embryotoxicity was observed in rats in the absence of maternal toxicity.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34080-2">
<a name="section-8.8"></a><p></p>
<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Theophylline is excreted into breast milk and may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span> or other signs of mild toxicity in nursing human infants. The concentration of theophylline in breast milk is about equivalent to the maternal serum concentration. An infant ingesting a liter of breast milk containing 10-20 mcg/mL of theophylline per day is likely to receive 10-20 mg of theophylline per day. Serious adverse effects in the infant are unlikely unless the mother has toxic serum theophylline concentrations.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34081-0">
<a name="section-8.9"></a><p></p>
<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Theophylline is safe and effective for the approved indications in pediatric patients (See, <a href="#AAEE5D9B-51F9-4D1D-BE24-A5300AB8670E">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</a>). The maintenance dose of theophylline must be selected with caution in pediatric patients since the rate of theophylline clearance is highly variable across the age range of neonates to adolescents (see <a href="#A0DCCEE0-9510-40CD-A8C8-170A578776D0">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>, <a href="#ADAE44B6-3FB7-44E3-A092-333D1F9630A8">Table I</a>, <a href="#A3125938-25AC-43D7-A633-0E6438581574">WARNINGS</a>, and <a href="#A2D6DC10-A033-4FFD-B9B6-D90E0175827A">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>, <a href="#AE68EE70-F2B8-4C5F-A32F-DBFFD19CCF0B">Table V</a>). Due to the immaturity of theophylline metabolic pathways in infants under the age of one year, particular attention to dosage selection and frequent monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations are required when theophylline is prescribed to pediatric patients in this age group.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34082-8">
<a name="section-8.10"></a><p></p>
<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Elderly patients are at significantly greater risk of experiencing serious toxicity from theophylline than younger patients due to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes</p>
<p>associated with aging. Theophylline clearance is reduced in patients greater than 60 years of age, resulting in increased serum theophylline concentrations in response to a given theophylline dose. Protein binding may be decreased in the elderly resulting in a larger proportion of the total serum theophylline concentration in the pharmacologically active unbound form. Elderly patients also appear to be more sensitive to the toxic effects of theophylline after chronic overdosage than younger patients. For these reasons, the maximum daily dose of theophylline in patients greater than 60 years of age ordinarily should not exceed 400 mg/day unless the patient continues to be symptomatic and the peak steady state serum theophylline concentration is &lt;10 mcg/mL (see <a href="#A2D6DC10-A033-4FFD-B9B6-D90E0175827A">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>). Theophylline doses greater than 400 mg/d should be prescribed with caution in elderly patients.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Adverse reactions associated with theophylline are generally mild when peak serum theophylline concentrations are &lt;20 mcg/mL and mainly consist of transient caffeine-like adverse effects such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>. When peak serum theophylline concentrations exceed 20 mcg/mL, however, theophylline produces a wide range of adverse reactions including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="27321" conceptname="Persistent vomiting">persistent vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmias</span>, and intractable <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> which can be lethal (see <a href="#A59B993A-6CF3-4246-9AE4-0E5B30A1C0DC">OVERDOSAGE</a>). The transient caffeine-like adverse reactions occur in about 50% of patients when theophylline therapy is initiated at doses higher than recommended initial doses (e.g.,&gt;300 mg/day in adults and &gt;12 mg/kg/day in children beyond &gt;1 year of age). During the initiation of theophylline therapy, caffeine-like adverse effects may transiently alter patient behavior, especially in school age children, but this response rarely persists. Initiation of theophylline therapy at a low dose with subsequent slow titration to a predetermined age-related maximum dose will significantly reduce the frequency of these transient adverse effects (see <a href="#A2D6DC10-A033-4FFD-B9B6-D90E0175827A">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>, <a href="#AE68EE70-F2B8-4C5F-A32F-DBFFD19CCF0B">Table V</a>). In a small percentage of patients (&lt;3% of children and &lt;10% of adults) the caffeine-like adverse effects persist during maintenance therapy, even at peak serum theophylline concentrations within the therapeutic range (i.e., 10-20 mcg/mL). Dosage reduction may alleviate the caffeine-like adverse effects in these patients, however, persistent adverse effects should result in a reevaluation of the need for continued theophylline therapy and the potential therapeutic benefit of alternative treatment.</p>
<p>Other adverse reactions that have been reported at serum theophylline concentrations &lt;20 mcg/mL include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">restlessness</span>, fine skeletal muscle <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremors</span>, and transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span>.

The occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> in elderly patients with serum theophylline concentrations &lt;20 mcg/mL may be secondary to decreased protein binding resulting in a larger proportion of the total serum theophylline concentration in the pharmacologically active unbound form. The clinical characteristics of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> reported in patients with serum theophylline concentrations &lt;20 mcg/mL have generally been milder than <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> associated with excessive serum theophylline concentrations resulting from an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> (i.e., they have generally been transient, often stopped without anticonvulsant therapy, and did not result in neurological residua).</p>
<p>Products containing aminophylline may rarely produce severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergic reactions</span> of the skin, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4270887" conceptname="Erythroderma">exfoliative dermatitis</span>, after systemic administration in a patient who has been previously sensitized by topical application of a substance containing ethylenediamine.

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-10.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>General:</h2>
<p class="First">The chronicity and pattern of theophylline overdosage significantly influences clinical manifestations of toxicity, management and outcome. There are two common presentations:</p>
<p><span class="Italics">(1) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">acute overdose</span></span>, i.e., ingestion of a single large excessive dose (&gt;10 mg/kg) as occurs in the context of an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4219484" conceptname="Suicide attempt">attempted suicide</span> or isolated medication error, and (2) <span class="Italics">chronic overdosage</span>, i.e., ingestion of repeated doses that are excessive for the patientâ€™s rate of theophylline clearance. The most common causes of chronic theophylline overdosage include patient or care giver error in dosing, clinician prescribing of an excessive dose or a normal dose in the presence of factors known to decrease the rate of theophylline clearance, and increasing the dose in response to an exacerbation of symptoms without first measuring the serum theophylline concentration to determine whether a dose increase is safe.</p>
<p>Severe toxicity from theophylline <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> is a relatively rare event. In one health maintenance organization, the frequency of hospital admissions for chronic overdosage of theophylline was about 1 per 1000 person-years exposure. In another study, among 6000 blood samples obtained for measurement of serum theophylline concentration, for any reason, from patients treated in an emergency department, 7% were in the 20-30 mcg/mL range and 3% were &gt;30 mcg/mL. Approximately two-thirds of the patients with serum theophylline concentrations in the 20-30 mcg/mL range had one or more manifestations of toxicity while &gt;90% of patients with serum theophylline concentrations &gt;30 mcg/mL were clinically intoxicated. Similarly, in other reports, serious toxicity from theophylline is seen principally at serum concentrations &gt;30 mcg/mL.</p>
<p>Several studies have described the clinical manifestations of theophylline <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> and attempted to determine the factors that predict life-threatening toxicity. In general, patients who experience an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">acute overdose</span> are less likely to experience <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> than patients who have experienced a chronic overdosage, unless the peak serum theophylline concentration is &gt;100 mcg/mL. After a chronic overdosage, generalized <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>, life-threatening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmias</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> may occur at serum theophylline concentrations &gt;30 mcg/mL. The severity of toxicity after chronic overdosage is more strongly correlated with the patientâ€™s age than the peak serum theophylline concentration; patients &gt;60 years are at the greatest risk for severe toxicity and mortality after a chronic overdosage. Pre-existing or concurrent disease may also significantly increase the susceptibility of a patient to a particular toxic manifestation, e.g., patients with neurologic disorders have an increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> and patients with cardiac disease have an increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmias</span> for a given serum theophylline concentration compared to patients without the underlying disease.</p>
<p>The frequency of various reported manifestations of theophylline <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> according to the mode of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> are listed in Table IV.</p>
<p>Other manifestations of theophylline toxicity include increases in serum calcium, creatine kinase, myoglobin and leukocyte count, decreases in serum phosphate and magnesium, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">acute myocardial infarction</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192450" conceptname="Retention of urine">urinary retention</span> in men with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194406" conceptname="Urinary tract obstruction">obstructive uropathy</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">Seizures</span> associated with serum theophylline concentrations &gt;30 mcg/mL are often resistant to anticonvulsant therapy and may result in irreversible brain injury if not rapidly controlled. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Death</span> from theophylline toxicity is most often secondary to cardiorespiratory arrest and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377845" conceptname="Anoxic encephalopathy">hypoxic encephalopathy</span> following prolonged generalized <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> or intractable <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmias</span> causing hemodynamic compromise.</p>

<p><span class="Bold Underline">concentrations may continue to increase after presentation of the patient for medical care.)</span></p>
<p>1. While simultaneously instituting treatment, contact a regional poison center to obtain updated</p>
<p>information and advice on individualizing the recommendations that follow.</p>
<p>2. Institute supportive care, including establishment of intravenous access, maintenance of the</p>
<p>airway, and electrocardiographic monitoring.</p>
<p>3. <span class="Underline">Treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span></span> Because of the high morbidity and mortality associated with</p>
<p>theophylline-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>, treatment should be rapid and aggressive. Anticonvulsant therapy should be initiated with an intravenous benzodiazepine, e.g., diazepam, in increments of 0.1-0.2 mg/kg every 1-3 minutes until <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> are terminated. Repetitive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> should be treated with a loading dose of phenobarbital (20 mg/kg infused over 30-60 minutes). Case reports of theophylline <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> in humans and animal studies suggest that phenytoin is ineffective in terminating theophylline-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>. The doses of benzodiazepines and phenobarbital required to terminate theophylline-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> are close to the doses that may cause severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317109" conceptname="Respiratory arrest">respiratory arrest</span>; the clinician should therefore be prepared to provide assisted ventilation. Elderly patients and patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255573" conceptname="Chronic obstructive lung disease">COPD</span> may be more susceptible to the respiratory depressant effects of anticonvulsants. Barbiturate-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span> or administration of general anesthesia may be required to terminate repetitive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span>. General anesthesia should be used with caution in patients with theophylline <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> because fluorinated volatile anesthetics may sensitize the myocardium to endogenous catecholamines released by theophylline. Enflurane appears less likely to be associated with this effect than halothane and may, therefore, be safer. Neuromuscular blocking agents alone should not be used to terminate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> since they abolish the musculoskeletal manifestations without terminating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> activity in the brain.</p>
<p>4. <span class="Underline">Anticipate Need for Anticonvulsants</span> In patients with theophylline <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> who are at high</p>
<p>risk for theophylline-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>, e.g., patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">acute overdoses</span> and serum theophylline concentrations &gt;100 mcg/mL or chronic overdosage in patients &gt;60 years of age with serum theophylline concentrations &gt;30 mcg/mL, the need for anticonvulsant therapy should be anticipated. A benzodiazepine such as diazepam should be drawn into a syringe and kept at the patientâ€™s bedside and medical personnel qualified to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> should be immediately available. In selected patients at high risk for theophylline-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>, consideration should be given to the administration of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118659" conceptname="Prophylactic">prophylactic</span> anticonvulsant therapy. Situations where <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118659" conceptname="Prophylactic">prophylactic</span> anticonvulsant therapy should be considered in high risk patients include anticipated delays in instituting methods for extracorporeal removal of theophylline (e.g., transfer of a high risk patient from one health care facility to another for extracorporeal removal) and clinical circumstances that significantly interfere with efforts to enhance theophylline clearance (e.g., a neonate where dialysis may not be technically feasible or a patient with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> unresponsive to antiemetics who is unable to tolerate multiple-dose oral activated charcoal). In animal studies, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118659" conceptname="Prophylactic">prophylactic</span> administration of phenobarbital, <span class="Underline">but not phenytoin</span>, has been shown to delay the onset of theophylline-induced generalized <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> and to increase the dose of theophylline required to induce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> (i.e., markedly increases the LD<span class="Sub">50</span>). Although there are no controlled studies in humans, a loading dose of intravenous phenobarbital (20 mg/kg infused over 60 minutes) may delay or prevent life-threatening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> in high risk patients while efforts to enhance theophylline clearance are continued. Phenobarbital may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, particularly in elderly patients and patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255573" conceptname="Chronic obstructive lung disease">COPD</span>.</p>
<p>5. <span class="Underline">Treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmias</span></span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4007310" conceptname="Sinus tachycardia">Sinus tachycardia</span> and simple ventricular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316429" conceptname="Premature beats">premature beats</span> are</p>
<p>not harbingers of life-threatening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span>, they do not require treatment in the absence of hemodynamic compromise, and they resolve with declining serum theophylline concentrations. Other <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span>, especially those associated with hemodynamic compromise, should be treated with antiarrhythmic therapy appropriate for the type of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span>.</p>
<p>6. <span class="Underline">Gastrointestinal decontamination</span> Oral activated charcoal (0.5 g/kg up to 20 g and repeat at</p>
<p>least once 1-2 hours after the first dose) is extremely effective in blocking the absorption of theophylline throughout the gastrointestinal tract, even when administered several hours after ingestion. If the patient is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, the charcoal should be administered through a nasogastric tube or after administration of an antiemetic. Phenothiazine antiemetics such as prochlorperazine or perphenazine should be avoided since they can lower the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> threshold and frequently cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375800" conceptname="Dystonia">dystonic reactions</span>. A single dose of sorbitol may be used to promote stooling to facilitate removal of theophylline bound to charcoal from the gastrointestinal tract. Sorbitol, however, should be dosed with caution since it is a potent purgative which can cause profound fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, particularly after multiple doses. Commercially available fixed combinations of liquid charcoal and sorbitol should be avoided in young children and after the first dose in adolescents and adults since they do not allow for individualization of charcoal and sorbitol dosing. Ipecac syrup should be avoided in theophylline <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span>. Although ipecac induces <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span>, it does not reduce the absorption of theophylline unless administered within 5 minutes of ingestion and even then is less effective than oral activated charcoal. Moreover, ipecac induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> may persist for several hours after a single dose and significantly decrease the retention and the effectiveness of oral activated charcoal.</p>
<p>7. <span class="Underline">Serum Theophylline Concentration Monitoring</span> The serum theophylline concentration should</p>
<p>be measured immediately upon presentation, 2-4 hours later, and then at sufficient intervals, e.g., every 4 hours, to guide treatment decisions and to assess the effectiveness of therapy. Serum theophylline concentrations may continue to increase after presentation of the patient for medical care as a result of continued absorption of theophylline from the gastrointestinal tract. Serial monitoring of serum theophylline serum concentrations should be continued until it is clear that the concentration is no longer rising and has returned to non-toxic levels.</p>
<p>8. <span class="Underline">General Monitoring Procedures</span> Electrocardiographic monitoring should be initiated on</p>
<p>presentation and continued until the serum theophylline level has returned to a non-toxic level. Serum electrolytes and glucose should be measured on presentation and at appropriate intervals indicated by clinical circumstances. Fluid and electrolyte abnormalities should be promptly corrected. <span class="Bold">Monitoring and treatment should be continued until the serum concentration decreases below 20 mcg/mL.</span></p>
<p>9. <span class="Underline">Enhance clearance of theophylline</span> Multiple-dose oral activated charcoal (e.g., 0.5 g/kg up to</p>
<p>20 g, every two hours) increases the clearance of theophylline at least twofold</p>
<p>by adsorption of theophylline secreted into gastrointestinal fluids. Charcoal must be retained in, and pass through, the gastrointestinal tract to be effective; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> should therefore be controlled by administration of appropriate antiemetics. Alternatively, the charcoal can be administered continuously through a nasogastric tube in conjunction with appropriate antiemetics. A single dose of sorbitol may be administered with the activated charcoal to promote stooling to facilitate clearance of the adsorbed theophylline from the gastrointestinal tract. Sorbitol alone does not enhance clearance of theophylline and should be dosed with caution to prevent excessive stooling which can result in severe fluid and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022093" conceptname="Electrolyte imbalance">electrolyte imbalances</span>. Commercially available fixed combinations of liquid charcoal and sorbitol should be avoided in young children and after the first dose in adolescents and adults since they do not allow for individualization of charcoal and sorbitol dosing. In patients with intractable <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, extracorporeal methods of theophylline removal should be instituted (see <a href="#A59B993A-6CF3-4246-9AE4-0E5B30A1C0DC">OVERDOSAGE</a>, <a href="#AC933536-9E43-4F01-B69A-26C9A5B5FA80">Extracorporeal Removal</a>).</p>

<h2>Extracorporeal Removal:</h2>
<p class="First">Increasing the rate of theophylline clearance by extracorporeal methods may rapidly decrease serum concentrations, but the risks of the procedure must be weighed against the potential benefit. Charcoal hemoperfusion is the most effective method of extracorporeal removal, increasing theophylline clearance up to six fold, but serious complications, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435510" conceptname="Hypocalcemia">hypocalcemia</span>, platelet consumption and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> diatheses may occur. Hemodialysis is about as efficient as multiple-dose oral activated charcoal and has a lower risk of serious complications than charcoal hemoperfusion. Hemodialysis should be considered as an alternative when charcoal hemoperfusion is not feasible and multiple-dose oral charcoal is ineffective because of intractable <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span>. Serum theophylline concentrations may rebound 5-10 mcg/mL after discontinuation of charcoal hemoperfusion or hemodialysis due to redistribution of theophylline from the tissue compartment. Peritoneal dialysis is ineffective for theophylline removal; exchange transfusions in neonates have been minimally effective.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-11.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>General Considerations:</h2>
<p class="First">The steady-state peak serum theophylline concentration is a function of the dose, the dosing interval, and the rate of theophylline absorption and clearance in the individual patient. Because of marked individual differences in the rate of theophylline clearance, the dose required to achieve a peak serum theophylline concentration in the 10-20 mcg/mL range varies fourfold among otherwise similar patients in the absence of factors known to alter theophylline clearance (e.g., 400-1600 mg/day in adults &lt;60 years old and 10-36 mg/kg/day in children 1-9 years old). For a given population there is no single theophylline dose that will provide both safe and effective serum concentrations for all patients. Administration of the median theophylline dose required to achieve a therapeutic serum theophylline concentration in a given population may result in either sub-therapeutic or potentially toxic serum theophylline concentrations in individual patients. For example, at a dose of 900 mg/d in adults &lt;60 years or 22 mg/kg/d in children 1-9 years, the steady-state peak serum theophylline concentration will be &lt;10 mcg/mL in about 30% of patients, 10-20 mcg/mL in about 50% and 20-30 mcg/mL in about 20% of patients. <span class="Bold Underline">The dose of theophylline must be individualized on the basis of peak serum theophylline concentration measurements in order to achieve a dose that will provide maximum potential benefit with minimal risk of adverse effects.</span></p>
<p>Transient caffeine-like adverse effects and excessive serum concentrations in slow metabolizers can be avoided in most patients by starting with a sufficiently low dose and slowly increasing the dose, <span class="Underline">if judged to be clinically indicated</span>, in small increments (See <a href="#AE68EE70-F2B8-4C5F-A32F-DBFFD19CCF0B">Table V</a>). Dose increases should only be made if the previous dosage is well tolerated and at intervals of no less than 3 days to allow serum theophylline concentrations to reach the new steady state. Dosage adjustment should be guided by serum theophylline concentration measurement (see <a href="#A45FA899-5688-4104-A1C0-DA0ACE031E68">PRECAUTIONS</a>, <a href="#A438CE86-4768-45C6-80DC-FB17E9B064E2">Laboratory Test</a>s and <a href="#A2D6DC10-A033-4FFD-B9B6-D90E0175827A">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>, <a href="#A32876EF-86DB-4E57-80A1-C723266182E1">Table VI</a>). Health care providers should instruct patients and care givers to discontinue any dosage that causes adverse effects, to withhold the medication until these symptoms are gone and to then resume therapy at a lower, previously tolerated dosage (see <a href="#A3125938-25AC-43D7-A633-0E6438581574">WARNINGS</a>).</p>
<p>If the patientâ€™s symptoms are well controlled, there are no apparent adverse effects, and no intervening factors that might alter dosage requirements (see <a href="#A3125938-25AC-43D7-A633-0E6438581574">WARNINGS</a> and <a href="#A45FA899-5688-4104-A1C0-DA0ACE031E68">PRECAUTIONS</a>), serum theophylline concentrations should be monitored at 6 month intervals for rapidly growing children and at yearly intervals for all others. In acutely ill patients, serum theophylline concentrations should be monitored at frequent intervals, e.g., every 24 hours.</p>
<p>Theophylline distributes poorly into body fat, therefore, mg/kg dose should be calculated on the basis of ideal body weight.</p>
<p>Table V contains theophylline dosing titration schema recommended for patients in various age groups and clinical circumstances. Table VI contains recommendations for theophylline dosage adjustment based upon serum theophylline concentrations. <span class="Bold Underline">Application of these general dosing recommendations to individual patients must take into account the unique clinical characteristics of each patient. In general, these recommendations should serve as the upper limit for dosage adjustments in order to decrease the risk of potentially serious adverse events associated with unexpected large increases in serum theophylline concentration.</span></p>

Since the time required to reach steady-state is a function of theophylline half-life, up to 5 days may be required to achieve steady-state in a premature neonate while only 2-3 days may be required in a 6 month old infant without other risk factors for impaired clearance in the absence of a loading dose. <span class="Bold">If a serum theophylline concentration is obtained before steady-state is achieved, the maintenance dose should not be increased, even if the serum theophylline concentration is &lt;10 mcg/mL.</span></p>

<p><span class="Bold">D.</span><span class="Bold Underline">Loading Dose for Acute Bronchodilatation:</span></p>
<p>An inhaled beta-2 selective agonist, alone or in combination with a systemically administered corticosteroid, is the most effective treatment for acute exacerbations of reversible airways obstruction. Theophylline is a relatively weak bronchodilator, is less effective than an inhaled beta-2 selective agonist and provides no added benefit in the treatment of acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256717" conceptname="Bronchospasm">bronchospasm</span>. If an inhaled or parenteral beta agonist is not available, a loading dose of an oral immediate release theophylline can be used as a temporary measure. A single 5 (**5<span class="Bold">.</span>8) mg/kg dose of aminophylline, in a patient who has not received any theophylline in the previous 24 hours, will produce an average peak serum theophylline concentration of 10 mcg/mL (range 5-15 mcg/mL). If dosing with theophylline is to be continued beyond the loading dose, the guidelines in Sections A.1.b., B.3, or C., above, should be utilized and serum theophylline concentration monitored at 24 hour intervals to adjust final dosage.</p>
<p>*Â  Patients with more rapid metabolism, clinically identified by higher than average dose</p>
<p>requirements, should receive a smaller dose more frequently to prevent breakthrough symptoms resulting from low trough concentrations before the next dose. A reliably absorbed slow-release formulation will decrease fluctuations and permit longer dosing intervals.</p>
<p>â€ Â  For products containing theophylline salts, the appropriate dose of the theophylline salt should</p>
<p>be substituted for the anhydrous theophylline dose. To calculate the equivalent dose for theophylline salts, divide the anhydrous theophylline dose listed below by 0<span class="Bold">.</span>65 for oxtriphylline, and by 0<span class="Bold">.</span>5 for the calcium salicylate and sodium glycinate salts.
