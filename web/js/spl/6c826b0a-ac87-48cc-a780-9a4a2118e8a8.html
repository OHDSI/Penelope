<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Morphine is a natural product that is the prototype for the class 
of natural and synthetic opioid analgesics. Opioids produce a wide spectrum of 
pharmacologic effects including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4148767" conceptname="Dysphoric mood">dysphoria</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142453" conceptname="Feeling high">euphoria</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, diminished gastrointestinal motility, altered 
circulatory dynamics, histamine release and physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>.</p>
<p>Morphine produces both its therapeutic and its adverse effects by interaction 
with one or more classes of specific opioid receptors located throughout the 
body.  Morphine acts as a pure agonist, binding with and activating opioid 
receptors at sites in the peri-aqueductal and peri-ventricular grey matter, the 
ventro-medial medulla and the spinal cord to produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>.</p>
<a href="#section-5"></a><a href="#section-5"></a>Effects on the Central Nervous System<p>The principal actions of therapeutic value of morphine are 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> and sedation (i.e., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> and anxiolysis). The precise mechanism 
of the analgesic action is unknown.  However, specific CNS opiate receptors and 
endogenous compounds with morphine-like activity have been identified throughout 
the brain and spinal cord and are likely to play a role in the expression of 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effects</span>.  Morphine produces <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> by direct action on 
brainstem respiratory centers.  The mechanism of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> involves 
a reduction in the responsiveness of the brainstem respiratory centers to 
increases in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135927" conceptname="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4200706" conceptname="Tension">tension</span>, and to electrical stimulation.  Morphine 
depresses the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> reflex by direct effect on the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> center in the medulla.  
Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>.  Morphine causes <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435279" conceptname="Tonic pupillary reaction">miosis</span>, even in total darkness, and little tolerance 
develops to this effect.  Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> but are 
not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may 
produce similar findings).  Marked <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4290615" conceptname="Dilated pupil">mydriasis</span> rather than <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435279" conceptname="Tonic pupillary reaction">miosis</span> may be seen with 
worsening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxia</span> in the setting of KADIAN® <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> (See <a href="#section-"> OVERDOSAGE</a>).</p>
<a href="#section-5"></a><a href="#section-5"></a>Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth 
Muscle<p>Gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions are decreased by 
morphine.  Morphine causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase 
in tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum.  Digestion of food in the 
small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased.  
Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone is increased 
to the point of spasm. The end result is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">constipation</span>.  Morphine can cause a 
marked increase in biliary tract pressure as a result of spasm of the sphincter 
of Oddi.</p>
<a href="#section-5"></a><a href="#section-5"></a>Effects on the Cardiovascular System<p>Morphine produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">syncope</span>.  Release of histamine may be induced by

histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318566" conceptname="Flushing">flushing</span>,

<a href="#section-5"></a><a href="#section-5"></a>Pharmacodynamics<p>Plasma Level-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">Analgesia</span> Relationships<br>In any particular 
patient, both <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effects</span> and plasma morphine concentrations are related 
to the morphine dose.</p>
<p>While plasma morphine-efficacy relationships can be demonstrated in 
non-tolerant individuals, they are influenced by a wide variety of factors and 
are not generally useful as a guide to the clinical use of morphine. The 
effective dose in opioid-tolerant patients may be 10-50 times as great (or 
greater) than the appropriate dose for opioid-naive individuals.  Dosages of 
morphine should be chosen and must be titrated on the basis of clinical 
evaluation of the patient and the balance between therapeutic and adverse 
effects.</p>
<p>For any fixed dose and dosing interval, KADIAN® will have, at steady-state, a 
lower C<span class="Sub">max</span> and a higher C<span class="Sub">min</span> than 
conventional morphine.</p>
<a href="#section-5"></a><a href="#section-5"></a>Pharmacokinetics<p>KADIAN® capsules contain polymer coated extended-release pellets 
of morphine sulfate that release morphine significantly more slowly than from 
conventional oral preparations. KADIAN® activity is primarily due to morphine. 
One metabolite, morphine-6-glucuronide, has been shown to have analgesic 
activity, but does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p>Following oral administration of morphine, the extent of absorption is 
essentially the same for immediate or extended-release formulations, although 
the time to peak blood level (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) will be longer and 
the C<span class="Sub">max</span> will be lower for formulations that delay the 
release of morphine in the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
<p>Elimination of morphine is primarily via hepatic metabolism to glucuronide 
metabolites (55 to 65%) which are then renally excreted. The terminal half-life 
of morphine is 2 to 4 hours, however, a longer term half-life of about 15 hours 
has been reported in studies where blood has been sampled up to 48 hours.</p>
<p>The single-dose pharmacokinetics of KADIAN® are linear over the dosage range 
of 30 to 100 mg. The single dose and multiple dose pharmacokinetic parameters of 
KADIAN® in normal volunteers are summarized in Table 1.</p>

KADIAN® to healthy volunteers, this occurs, on average, after 8 hours. As with 
most forms of oral morphine, because of pre-systemic elimination, only about 20 
to 40% of the administered dose reaches the systemic circulation.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Food Effects</span>: While concurrent administration of 
food slows the rate of absorption of KADIAN®, the extent of absorption is not 
affected and KADIAN® can be administered without regard to meals.</p>

<a href="http://"></a>Distribution<p>Once absorbed, morphine is distributed to skeletal muscle, 
kidneys, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen and brain.  The volume of 
distribution of morphine is approximately 3 to 4 L/kg. Morphine is 30 to 35% 
reversibly bound to plasma proteins.  Although the primary site of action of 
morphine is in the CNS, only small quantities pass the blood-brain barrier. 
Morphine also crosses the placental membranes (see <a href="#A3EA5638-C1B7-477C-8530-3ABABA1AC7BE">PRECAUTIONS-Pregnancy</a>) and has 
been found in breast milk (see <a href="#AA923596-DC96-472B-AC19-DCF5A2EBAF90">PRECAUTIONS-Nursing 
Mothers</a>).</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Metabolism<p>The major pathway of the detoxification of morphine is 
conjugation, either with D-glucuronic acid in the liver to produce glucuronides 
or with sulfuric acid to give morphine-3-etheral sulfate.  Although a small 
fraction (less than 5%) of morphine is demethylated, for all practical purposes, 
virtually all morphine is converted to glucuronide metabolites including 
morphine-3-glucuronide, M3G (about 50%) and morphine-6-glucuronide, M6G (about 5 
to 15%). Studies in healthy subjects and cancer patients have shown that the 
glucuronide metabolite to morphine mean molar ratios (based on AUC) are similar 
after both single doses and at steady state for KADIAN®, 12-hour 
extended-release morphine sulfate tablets and morphine sulfate solution.</p>
<p>M3G has no significant analgesic activity. M6G has been shown to have opioid 
agonist and analgesic activity in humans.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Excretion<p>Approximately 10% of morphine dose is excreted unchanged in the 
urine.  Most of the dose is excreted in the urine as M3G and M6G. A small amount 
of the glucuronide metabolites is excreted in the bile and there is some minor 
enterohepatic cycling.  Seven to 10% of administered morphine is excreted in the 
feces.</p>
<p>The mean adult plasma clearance is about 20-30 mL/minute/kg. The effective 
terminal half-life of morphine after IV administration is reported to be 
approximately 2.0 hours.  Longer plasma sampling in some studies suggests a 
longer terminal half-life of morphine of about 15 hours.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Special Populations<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Geriatric<p>The elderly may have increased sensitivity to morphine and may 
achieve higher and more variable serum levels than younger patients.  In adults, 
the duration of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> increases progressively with age, though the degree of 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> remains unchanged.  KADIAN® pharmacokinetics have not been 
investigated in elderly patients (&gt;65 years) although such patients were 
included in the clinical studies.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Nursing Mothers<p>Morphine is excreted in the maternal milk, and the milk to plasma 
morphine AUC ratio is about 2.5:1. The amount of morphine received by the infant 
depends on the maternal plasma concentration, amount of milk ingested by the 
infant, and the extent of first pass metabolism.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pediatric<p>Infants under 1 month of age have a prolonged elimination 
half-life and decreased clearance relative to older infants and pediatric 
patients. The clearance of morphine and its elimination half-life begin to 
approach adult values by the second month of life. Pediatric patients old enough 
to take capsules should have pharmacokinetic parameters similar to adults, dosed 
on a per kilogram basis (see <a href="#A6744D72-828F-4B0E-94C8-89FE5F93C23C">PRECAUTIONS-Pediatric 
Use</a>).</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Gender<p>No meaningful differences between male and female patients were 
demonstrated in the analysis of the pharmacokinetic data from clinical 
studies.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Race<p>Pharmacokinetic differences due to race may exist.  Chinese 
subjects given intravenous morphine in one study had a higher clearance when

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<a href="http://"></a>General<p class="First">KADIAN® is intended for use in patients who require continuous, 
around-the-clock opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> for an extended period of time.  As with any 
potent opioid, it is critical to adjust the dosing regimen for KADIAN® for each 
patient, taking into account the patient's prior analgesic treatment 
experience.  Although it is clearly impossible to enumerate every consideration 
that is important to the selection of the initial dose of KADIAN®, attention 
should be given to the points under <a href="#A79A19A5-6403-4EFC-ABC1-ED70877F8819">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>.</p>
<p>Opioid analgesics have a narrow therapeutic index in certain patient 
populations, especially when combined with CNS depressant drugs, and should be 
reserved for cases where the benefits of opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> outweigh the known 
risks of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, altered mental state, and postural 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>.</p>
<p>Selection of patients for treatment with KADIAN® should be governed by the 
same principles that apply to the use of any potent opioid analgesics.  
Specifically, the increased risks associated with its use in the following 
populations should be considered: the elderly or debilitated and those with 
severe impairment of hepatic, pulmonary, or renal function; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140673" conceptname="Hypothyroidism">hypothyroidism</span>; 
adrenocortical insufficiency (e.g., Addison's Disease); <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>;

patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.</p>
<p>Cimetidine:  There is an isolated report of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> and severe respiratory 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> when a hemodialysis patient was concurrently administered morphine 
and cimetidine.</p>
<p>Diuretics:  Morphine can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the 
release of antidiuretic hormone.  Morphine may also lead to acute retention of 
urine by causing spasm of the sphincter of the bladder, particularly in men with

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Carcinogenicity/Mutagenicity/Impairment of Fertility<p>Long-term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic 
potential of morphine have not been conducted. There are no reports of 
carcinogenic effects in humans. <span class="Italics">In vitro </span>studies have 
reported that morphine is non-mutagenic in the Ames test with <span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span>, </span>and induces chromosomal aberrations in human 
leukocytes and lethal mutation induction in <span class="Italics">Drosophila. 
</span>Morphine was found to be mutagenic <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>in 
human T-cells, increasing the DNA fragmentation. <span class="Italics">In vivo, 
</span>morphine was mutagenic in the mouse micronucleus test and induced 
chromosomal aberrations in spermatids and murine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span>. Chronic opioid 
abusers (e.g., heroin abusers) and their offspring display higher rates of 
chromosomal damage. However, the rates of chromosomal abnormalities were similar 
in nonexposed individuals and in heroin users enrolled in long term opioid 
maintenance programs.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pregnancy<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Teratogenic Effects (Pregnancy Category C)<p>Teratogenic effects of morphine have been reported in the animal 
literature. High parental doses during the second trimester were teratogenic in 
neurological, soft and skeletal tissue. The abnormalities included 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372887" conceptname="Disorder of brain">encephalopathy</span> and axial skeletal fusions. These doses were often maternally 
toxic and were 0.3 to 3-fold the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on a 
mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. The relative contribution of 
morphine-induced maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090739" conceptname="Nutritional disorder">malnutrition</span>, each of which can be 
teratogenic, has not been clearly defined. Treatment of male rats with 
approximately 3-fold the MRHD for 10 days prior to mating decreased litter size 
and viability.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Nonteratogenic Effects<p>Morphine given subcutaneously, at non-maternally toxic doses, to 
rats during the third trimester with approximately 0.15-fold the MRHD caused 
reversible reductions in brain and spinal cord volume, and testes size and body 
weight in the offspring, and decreased fertility in female offspring.  The 
offspring of rats and hamsters treated orally or intraperitoneally throughout 
pregnancy with 0.04- to 0.3-fold the MRHD of morphine have demonstrated delayed 
growth, motor and sexual maturation and decreased male fertility.  Chronic 
morphine exposure of fetal animals resulted in mild withdrawal, altered reflex 
and motor skill development, and altered responsiveness to morphine that 
persisted into adulthood.</p>
<p>There are no well-controlled studies of chronic <span class="Italics">in utero 
</span>exposure to morphine sulfate in human subjects. However, uncontrolled 
retrospective studies of human neonates chronically exposed to other opioids 
<span class="Italics">in utero, </span>demonstrated reduced brain volume which 
normalized over the first month of life.  Infants born to opioid-abusing mothers 
are more often <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="72726" conceptname="Light-for-dates with signs of fetal malnutrition">small for gestational age</span>, have a decreased ventilatory response 
to CO<span class="Sub">2</span> and increased risk of sudden infant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> 
syndrome.  KADIAN® should only be used during pregnancy if the need for strong 
opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Labor and Delivery<p>KADIAN® is not recommended for use in women during and 
immediately prior to labor, where shorter acting analgesics or other analgesic 
techniques are more appropriate.  Occasionally, opioid analgesics may prolong 
labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration and 
frequency of uterine contractions.  However, this effect is not consistent and 
may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation which tends to shorten 
labor.  Neonates whose mothers received opioid analgesics during labor should be 
observed closely for signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>.  A specific opioid 
antagonist, such as naloxone or nalmefene, should be available for reversal of 
opioid-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> in the neonate.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Neonatal Withdrawal Syndrome<p>Chronic maternal use of opiates or opioids during pregnancy 
coexposes the fetus. The newborn may experience subsequent neonatal withdrawal 
syndrome (NWS).  Manifestations of NWS include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">hyperactivity</span>,

loss, and failure to gain weight.  The onset, duration, and severity of the 
disorder differ based on such factors as the addictive drug used, time and 
amount of mother’s last dose, and rate of elimination of the drug from the 
newborn.  Approaches to the treatment of this syndrome have included supportive 
care and, when indicated, drugs such as paregoric or phenobarbital.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Nursing Mothers<p>Low levels of morphine sulfate have been detected in human milk.  
Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breast-feeding infants when maternal 
administration of morphine sulfate is stopped.  Because of the potential for 
adverse reactions in nursing infants from KADIAN®, a decision should be made 
whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the 
importance of the drug to the mother.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pediatric Use<p>The safety of KADIAN®, both the entire capsule and the pellets 
sprinkled on apple sauce, have not been directly investigated in pediatric 
patients below the age of 18 years.  The range of doses available is not 
suitable for the treatment of very young pediatric patients or those who are not 
old enough to take capsules safely.  The apple sauce sprinkling method is not an 
appropriate alternative for these patients.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Geriatric Use<p>Clinical studies of KADIAN® did not include sufficient numbers of 
subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from 
younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified 
differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, 
dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at 
the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased 
hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug 
therapy.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Serious adverse reactions that may be associated with KADIAN® 
therapy in clinical use are those observed with other opioid analgesics and 
include: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317109" conceptname="Respiratory arrest">respiratory arrest</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span>, circulatory

<p>The less severe adverse events seen on initiation of therapy with KADIAN® are 
also typical opioid side effects.  These events are dose dependent, and their 
frequency depends on the clinical setting, the patient's level of opioid 
tolerance, and host factors specific to the individual.  They should be expected 
and managed as a part of opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>.  The most frequent of these include 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">constipation</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>.  In many cases, the frequency of 
these events during initiation of therapy may be minimized by careful 
individualization of starting dosage, slow titration, and the avoidance of large 
rapid swings in plasma concentrations of the opioid.  Many of these adverse 
events, will cease or decrease as KADIAN® therapy is continued and some degree 
of tolerance is developed, but others may be expected to remain troublesome 
throughout therapy.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Management of Excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">Drowsiness</span><p>Most patients receiving KADIAN® will experience initial

<p>Excessive or persistent sedation should be investigated.  Factors to be 
considered should include: concurrent sedative medications, the presence of 
hepatic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxia</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4105765" conceptname="Hypercapnia">hypercapnia</span> due to exacerbated 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4256228" conceptname="Respiratory failure">respiratory failure</span>, intolerance to the dose used (especially in older 
patients), disease severity and the patient's general condition.</p>
<p>The dosage should be adjusted according to individual needs, but additional 
care should be used in the selection of initial doses for the elderly patient, 
the cachectic or gravely ill patient, or in patients not already familiar with 
opioid analgesic medications to prevent excessive sedation at the onset of 
treatment.</p>

suitable antiemetic should be considered, with the awareness that sedation may 
result (see <a href="#A1148DCF-0216-4A6B-BE8F-125068979CF6">Drug

Metoclopramide is often useful in such patients.</p>

elderly, debilitated or bedridden patients may become impacted.  Tolerance does 
not usually develop for the constipating effects of opioids.  Patients must be 
cautioned accordingly and laxatives, softeners and other appropriate treatments 
should be used prophylactically from the beginning of opioid therapy.</p>

<h1>DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">KADIAN® is a mu-agonist opioid with an abuse 
liability similar to other opioid agonists and is a Schedule II controlled 
substance.  KADIAN® and other opioids used in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> can be abused and are 
subject to criminal diversion.</span></p>
<p>KADIAN® is an opioid with no approved use in the management of addiction 
disorders.  Its proper usage in individuals with drug or alcohol <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>, 
either active or in remission, is for the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> requiring opioid 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug addiction</span> is characterized by compulsive use, use for non-medical 
purposes, and continued use despite harm or risk of harm.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug addiction</span> is a 
treatable disease, utilizing a multi-disciplinary approach, but relapse is 
common.</p>
<p>“Drug-seeking? behavior is very common in addicts and drug abusers.  
Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office 
hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated 
“loss? of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide 
prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s).  
“Doctor shopping? to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug 
abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction.</p>
<p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> and 
tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by 
concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> in all addicts.  In 
addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction and is 
characterized by misuse for non-medical purposes, often in combination with 
other psychoactive substances. KADIAN®, like other opioids, has been diverted 
for non-medical use.  Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, 
including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised.</p>
<p>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic 
re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate 
measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">KADIAN® is intended for oral use only.  Abuse of chewed, 
crushed, or dissolved capsules or pellets poses a hazard of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.  
This risk is increased with concurrent abuse of alcohol and other substances. 
Due to the presence of talc as one of the excipients in capsules, parenteral 
abuse can be expected to result in local tissue <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280654" conceptname="Necrosis">necrosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, pulmonary

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Treatment<p>Primary attention should be given to the re-establishment of a 
patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Gastric 
contents may need to be emptied to remove unabsorbed drug when an 
extended-release formulation such as KADIAN® has been taken.  Care should be 
taken to secure the airway before attempting treatment by gastric emptying or

<p>The pure opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> which results from opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>.  Since the duration 
of reversal would be expected to be less than the duration of action of KADIAN®, 
the patient must be carefully monitored until spontaneous respiration is 
reliably re-established.  KADIAN® will continue to release and add to the 
morphine load for up to 24 hours after administration and the management of an 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> should be monitored accordingly. If the response to opioid antagonists 
is suboptimal or not sustained, additional antagonist should be given as 
directed by the manufacturer of the product.</p>
<p>Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically 
significant respiratory or circulatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> secondary to morphine 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>.  Such agents should be administered cautiously to persons who are 
known, or suspected to be physically dependent on KADIAN®.  In such cases, an 
abrupt or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute 
abstinence syndrome.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Opioid Tolerant Individuals: </span>In an individual 
physically dependent on opioids, administration of the usual dose of the

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">KADIAN® may be administered once or twice daily.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">KADIAN® capsules should be swallowed whole.  The pellets in 
KADIAN® capsules should not be chewed, crushed, or dissolved due to the risk of 
rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of morphine.</span></p>
<p>Alternatively, KADIAN® capsules may be administered as a sprinkle on apple 
sauce or through a 16 French gastrostomy tube (see <a href="#A4DC1C12-AB13-43D1-85EE-822884580DB4">ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF 
ADMINISTRATION</a> section).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">The 100 mg and 200 mg capsules are for use only in 
opioid-tolerant patients.  </span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">KADIAN® is not indicated for pre-emptive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> 
(administration pre-operatively for the management of post-operative <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>), or 
for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> in the immediate post-operative period (the first 12 to 24 hours 
following surgery) for patients not previously taking the drug, because its 
safety in these settings have not been established. </span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">KADIAN® is only indicated for post-operative use if the 
patient is already receiving the drug prior to surgery or if the postoperative 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> is expected to be moderate to severe and persist for an extended period of 
time.  </span></p>
<p>Patients who are already receiving KADIAN® Capsules as part of ongoing 
analgesic therapy may be safely continued on the drug if appropriate dosage 
adjustments are made considering the procedure, other drugs given, and the 
temporary changes in physiology caused by the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4121697" conceptname="Surgery">surgical intervention</span>.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Initiating Therapy with KADIAN® Capsules<p>Physicians should individualize treatment using a progressive 
plan of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> management such as outlined by the World Health Organization, the 
American <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">Pain</span> Society and the Federation of State Medical Boards Model 
Guidelines.  Health care professionals should follow appropriate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> management 
principles of careful assessment and ongoing monitoring.</p>
<p>It is critical to adjust the dosing regimen for each patient individually, 
taking into account the patient's prior analgesic treatment experience.  In the 
selection of the initial dose of KADIAN®, attention should be given to:</p>
<ol>
<li><p class="First">the total daily dose, potency and kind of opioid the patient has 
been taking previously;</p></li>
<li><p class="First">the reliability of the relative potency estimate used to 
calculate the equivalent dose of morphine needed (Note: potency estimates may 
vary with the route of administration);</p></li>
<li><p class="First">the patient's degree of opioid experience and opioid 
tolerance;</p></li>
<li><p class="First">the general condition and medical status of the patient;</p></li>
<li><p class="First">concurrent medication;</p></li>
<li><p class="First">the type and severity of the patient's <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="Bold">Care should be taken to use low initial doses of KADIAN® in 
patients who are not already opioid-tolerant, especially those who are receiving 
concurrent treatment with muscle relaxants, sedatives, or other CNS active 
medications (</span>see <a href="#AE2F3FAD-540B-43A9-B7D7-A2079638996D">PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>
<p>During periods of changing analgesic requirements including initial 
titration, frequent communication is recommended between physician, other 
members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family.</p>
<p>The following dosing recommendations, therefore, can only be considered 
suggested approaches to what is actually a series of clinical decisions over 
time in the management of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> of an individual patient.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Conversion from Other Oral Morphine Formulations to 
KADIAN®<p>Patients on other oral morphine formulations may be converted to 
KADIAN® by administering one-half of the patient's total daily oral morphine 
dose as KADIAN® capsules every 12 hours (twice-a-day) or by administering the 
total daily oral morphine dose as KADIAN® capsules every 24 hours (once-a-day). 
KADIAN® should not be given more frequently than every 12 hours.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Conversion from Parenteral Morphine or Other Parenteral or 
Oral Opioids to KADIAN®<p>KADIAN® can be administered to patients previously receiving 
treatment with parenteral morphine or other opioids.  While there are useful 
tables of oral and parenteral equivalents in cancer <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, there is 
substantial interpatient variation in the relative potency of different opioid 
drugs and formulations.  For these reasons, it is better to underestimate the 
patient's 24-hour oral morphine requirement and provide rescue medication, than 
to overestimate and manage an adverse event. The following general points should 
be considered:</p>
<ol>
<li><p class="First">Parenteral to Oral Morphine Ratio:  It may take anywhere from 2-6 
mg of oral morphine to provide <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> equivalent to 1 mg of parenteral 
morphine.  A dose of oral morphine three times the daily parenteral morphine 
requirement may be sufficient in chronic use settings.</p></li>
<li><p class="First">Other Parenteral or Oral Opioids to Oral Morphine Sulfate:  There 
is lack of systematic evidence bearing on these types of analgesic 
substitutions.  Therefore, specific recommendations are not possible.  
Physicians are advised to refer to published relative potency data, keeping in 
mind that such ratios are only approximate.  In general, it is safest to give 
half of the estimated daily morphine demand as the initial dose, and to manage 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012238" conceptname="Inadequate analgesia">inadequate analgesia</span> by supplementation with immediate-release morphine. (See 
discussion which follows.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The first dose of KADIAN® may be taken with the last dose of any 
immediate-release (short-acting) opioid medication due to the long delay until 
the peak effect after administration of KADIAN®.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Use of KADIAN® as the First Opioid Analgesic<p>There has been no evaluation of KADIAN® as an initial opioid 
analgesic in the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>. Because it may be more difficult to titrate 
a patient to adequate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> using an extended-release morphine, it is 
ordinarily advisable to begin treatment using an immediate-release morphine 
formulation.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Individualization of Dosage<p>The best use of opioid analgesics in the management of chronic 
malignant and non-malignant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> is challenging, and is well described in 
materials published by the World Health Organization and the Agency for Health 
Care Policy and Research which are available from Alpharma Pharmaceuticals LLC 
upon request.  KADIAN® is a third step drug which is most useful when the 
patient requires a constant level of opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> as a "floor" or "platform" 
from which to manage breakthrough <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>.  When a patient has reached the point 
where comfort cannot be provided with a combination of non-opioid medications 
(NSAIDs and acetaminophen) and intermittent use of moderate or strong opioids, 
the patient's total opioid therapy should be converted into a 24 hour oral 
morphine equivalent.</p>
<p>KADIAN® should be started by administering one-half of the estimated total 
daily oral morphine dose every 12 hours (twice-a-day) <span class="Bold">or</span> 
by administering the total daily oral morphine dose every 24 hours 
(once-a-day).  The dose should be titrated no more frequently than 
every-other-day to allow the patients to stabilize before escalating the dose.  
If breakthrough <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> occurs, the dose may be supplemented with a small dose 
(less than 20% of the total daily dose) of a short-acting analgesic. Patients 
who are excessively sedated after a once-a-day dose or who regularly experience 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012238" conceptname="Inadequate analgesia">inadequate analgesia</span> before the next dose should be switched to twice-a-day 
dosing.</p>
<p>Patients who do not have a proven tolerance to opioids should be started only 
on the 10 mg or 20 mg strength, and usually should be increased at a rate not 
greater than 20 mg every-other-day.  Most patients will rapidly develop some 
degree of tolerance, requiring dosage adjustment until they have achieved their 
individual best balance between baseline <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> and opioid side effects such 
as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, sedation and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">constipation</span>.  No guidance can be given as to the 
recommended maximal dose, especially in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436096" conceptname="Chronic pain">chronic pain</span> of 
malignancy. In such cases the total dose of KADIAN® should be advanced until the 
desired therapeutic endpoint is reached or clinically significant opioid-related 
adverse reactions intervene.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Alternative Methods of Administration<p>In a study of healthy volunteers, KADIAN® pellets sprinkled over 
apple sauce were found to be bioequivalent to KADIAN® capsules swallowed whole 
with apple sauce under fasting conditions. Other foods have not been tested.  
Patients who have difficulty swallowing whole capsules or tablets may benefit 
from this alternative method of administration.</p>
<ol>
<li><p class="First">Sprinkle the pellets onto a small amount of apple sauce. Apple 
sauce should be room temperature or cooler.</p></li>
<li><p class="First">The patient must be cautioned not to chew the pellets which could 
result in the immediate release of a potentially dangerous, even fatal dose of 
morphine.</p></li>
<li><p class="First">Use immediately.</p></li>
<li><p class="First">Rinse mouth to ensure all pellets have been swallowed.</p></li>
<li><p class="First">Patients should consume entire portion and should not divide 
apple sauce into separate doses.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The entire capsule contents may alternatively be administered through a 16 
French gastrostomy tube.</p>
<ol>
<li><p class="First">Flush the gastrostomy tube with water to ensure that it is 
wet.</p></li>
<li><p class="First">Sprinkle the KADIAN® Pellets into 10 mL of water.</p></li>
<li><p class="First">Use a swirling motion to pour the pellets and water into the 
gastrostomy tube through a funnel.</p></li>
<li><p class="First">Rinse the beaker with a further 10 mL of water and pour this into 
the funnel.</p></li>
<li><p class="First">Repeat rinsing until no pellets remain in the 
beaker.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="Bold">THE ADMINISTRATION OF KADIAN</span>®<span class="Bold"> 
PELLETS THROUGH A NASOGASTRIC TUBE SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED.</span></p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Considerations in the Adjustment of Dosing Regimens<p>If signs of excessive opioid effects are observed early in the 
dosing interval, the next dose should be reduced.  If this adjustment leads to 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012238" conceptname="Inadequate analgesia">inadequate analgesia</span>, that is, if breakthrough <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> occurs when KADIAN® is 
administered on an every 24 hours dosing regimen, consideration should be given 
to dosing every 12 hours.  If breakthrough <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> occurs on a 12 hour dosing 
regimen a supplemental dose of a short-acting analgesic may be given.  As 
experience is gained, adjustments in both dose and dosing interval can be made 
to obtain an appropriate balance between <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relief and opioid side effects.  
To avoid accumulation the dosing interval of KADIAN® should not be reduced below 
12 hours.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Cessation of Therapy<p><span class="Bold">When the patient no longer requires therapy with 
KADIAN® capsules, doses should be tapered gradually to prevent signs and 
symptoms of withdrawal in the physically dependent patient.</span></p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Conversion from KADIAN® to Other Extended-Release Oral 
Morphine Formulations<p>KADIAN® is not bioequivalent to other extended-release morphine 
preparations.  Although for a given dose the same total amount of morphine is 
available from KADIAN® as from morphine solution or extended-release morphine 
tablets, the slower release of morphine from KADIAN® results in reduced maximum 
and increased minimum plasma morphine concentrations than with shorter acting 
morphine products.  Conversion from KADIAN® to the same total daily dose of 
extended-release morphine preparations may lead to either excessive sedation at 
peak or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012238" conceptname="Inadequate analgesia">inadequate analgesia</span> at trough and close observation and appropriate 
dosage adjustments are recommended.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Conversion from KADIAN® to Parenteral Opioids<p>When converting a patient from KADIAN® to parenteral opioids, it 
is best to calculate an equivalent parenteral dose, and then initiate treatment 
at half of this calculated value.  For example, to estimate the required 24 hour 
dose of parenteral morphine for a patient taking KADIAN®, one would take the 24 
hour KADIAN® dose, divide by an oral to parenteral conversion ratio of 3, divide 
the estimated 24 hour parenteral dose into six divided doses (for a four hour 
dosing interval), <span class="Underline">then halve this dose as an initial 
trial.</span></p>
<p>For example, to estimate the required parenteral morphine dose for a patient 
taking 360 mg of KADIAN® a day, divide the 360 mg daily oral morphine dose by a 
conversion ratio of 1 mg of parenteral morphine for every 3 mg of oral 
morphine.  The estimated 120 mg daily parenteral requirement is then divided 
into six 20 mg doses, and half of this, or 10 mg, is then given every 4 hours as 
an initial trial dose.</p>
<p>This approach is likely to require a dosage increase in the first 24 hours 
for many patients, but is recommended because it is less likely to cause 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> than trying to establish an equivalent dose without titration.</p>
