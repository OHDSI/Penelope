<a href="http://"></a>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY<span class="Bold">Hydrocodone Component </span><br>Hydrocodone is a semisynthetic 
opioid analgesic and antitussive with multiple actions qualitatively similar to 
those of codeine. Most of these involve the central nervous system and smooth 
muscle. The precise mechanism of action of hydrocodone and other opioids is not 
known, although it is believed to relate to the existence of opiate receptors in 
the central nervous system. In addition to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, opioids may produce 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, changes in mood, and mental clouding. <br><span class="Bold">Ibuprofen 
Component </span><br>Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent that 
possesses analgesic and antipyretic activities. Its mode action, like that of 
other NSAIDs, is not completely understood, but may be related to inhibition of 
cyclooxygenase activity and prostaglandin synthesis. Ibuprofen is a peripherally 
acting analgesic. Ibuprofen does not have any known effects on opiate receptors. 
<br><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span><br><span class="Underline">Absorption</span>: After oral dosing with the REPREXAINâ„¢tablet, 
a peak hydrocodone plasma level of 27 ng/mL is achieved at 1.7 hours, and a peak 
ibuprofen plasma level of 30 mcg/mL is achieved at 1.8 hours. The effect of food 
on the absorption of either component from the REPREXAINâ„¢ tablet has not been 
established.Â  <br><span class="Underline">Distribution</span>: Ibuprofen is highly 
protein-bound (99%) like most other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. 
Although the extent of protein binding of hydrocodone in human plasma has not 
been definitely determined, structural similarities to related opioid analgesics 
suggest that hydrocodone is not extensively protein bound. As most agents in the 
5-ring morphinan group of semi-synthetic opioids bind plasma protein to<br>a 
similar degree (range 19% [hydromorphone] to 45% [oxycodone]), hydrocodone is 
expected to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> within this range. <br><span class="Underline">Metabolism</span>: 
Hydrocodone exhibits a complex pattern of metabolism, including O-demethylation, 
N-demethylation, and 6-keto reduction to the corresponding 6-a-and 6-ÃŸhydroxy 
metabolites. Hydromorphone, a potent opioid, is formed from the O -demethylation 
of hydrocodone and contributes to the total <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span> of hydrocodone. The 
O-and N -demethylation processes are mediated by separate P-450 isoenzymes: 
CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, respectively. <br>Ibuprofen is present in this product as a 
racemate, and following absorption it undergoes interconversion in the plasma 
from the R-isomer to the S-isomer. Both the R- and S-isomers are metabolized to 
two primary metabolites:<br>(+)-2-4â€™-(2hydroxy-2-methyl-propyl) phenyl propionic 
acid and (+)-2-4â€™-(2carboxypropyl) phenyl propionic acid, both of 
which<br>circulate in the plasma at low levels relative to the parent.Â  
<br><span class="Underline">Elimination</span>: Hydrocodone and its metabolites 
are eliminated primarily in the kidneys, with a mean plasma half-life of 4.5 
hours. Ibuprofen is excreted in the urine, 50% to 60% as metabolites and 
approximately 15% as unchanged drug and conjugate. The plasma half-life is 2.2 
hours.Â  <br><span class="Underline">Special Populations</span>: No significant 
pharmacokinetic differences based on age or gender have been demonstrated. The 
pharmacokinetics of hydrocodone and ibuprofen from REPREXAINâ„¢ has not been 
evaluated in children. <br><span class="Underline"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal Impairment</span></span>:The 
effect of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> on the pharmacokinetics of the REPREXAINâ„¢ dosage 
form has not been determined.<br><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>CLINICAL STUDIES<p class="First">In single-dose studies of post surgical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> (abdominal, 
gynecological, orthopedic), 940 patients were studied at doses of one or two 
tablets. REPREXAINâ„¢ produced greater efficacy than placebo and each of its 
individual components given at the same dose. No advantage was demonstrated for 
the two-tablet dose.</p>

<a href="http://"></a>WARNINGS<p class="First"><span class="Bold">CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS </span><br>Cardiovascular 
Thrombotic Events <br>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and 
nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk 
of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, and 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, 
may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV 
disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV 
event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be 
used for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain 
alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV 
symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious 
CV events and the steps to take if they occur. <br>There is no consistent 
evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious 
CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin 
and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI events (see <span class="Bold">GI WARNINGS</span>). <br>Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a 
COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> in the first 10-14 days

REPREXAINâ„¢, can lead to onset of new <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> or worsening of preexisting 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV 
events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response

Abuse and Diversion of Opioids</span><br>REPREXAINâ„¢ contains hydrocodone an 
opioid agonist, and is a Schedule III controlled substance. Opioid agonists have 
the potential for being abused and are sought by abusers and people with 
addiction disorders, and are subject to diversion. <br>REPREXAINâ„¢ can be abused 
in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be 
considered when prescribing or dispensing REPREXAINâ„¢ in situations where the 
physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse or 
diversion (see <span class="Bold">DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></span>). <br><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">Respiratory Depression</span></span><br>At high doses or in

<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> by acting directly on the brain stem respiratory centers. Hydrocodone 
also affects the center that controls respiratory rhythm, and may produce 
irregular and periodic breathing. <br><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375415" conceptname="Injury of head">Head Injury</span> and Increased

exaggerated in the presence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375415" conceptname="Injury of head">head injury</span>, intracranial lesions or a 
pre-existing increase in intracranial pressure. Furthermore, opioids produce 
adverse reactions, which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head 
injuries. <br><span class="Bold">Acute Abdominal Conditions</span><br>The 
administration of opioids may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of 
patients with acute abdominal conditions.<br><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal 
(GI) Effects - Risk of GI Ulceration, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">Bleeding</span> and Perforation</span><br>NSAIDs, including REPREXAINâ„¢, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) 
adverse events including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, ulceration, and perforation of 
the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These 
serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, 
in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develops a 
serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcers</span>, gross <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 
1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2-4% of patients treated for 
one year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the 
likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of 
therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. <br>NSAIDs should 
be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcer</span> 
disease or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">gastrointestinal bleeding</span>. Patients with a prior history of peptic 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcer</span> disease and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">gastrointestinal bleeding</span> who use NSAIDs have a greater 
than 10-fold increased risk for developing a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">GI bleed</span> compared to patients with 
neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral 
corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, 
use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous 
reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, 
special care should be taken in treating this population. <br>To minimize the 
potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the 
lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. 
Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI 
ulceration and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional 
evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should 
include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled 
out. For high-risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs 
should be considered. <br><span class="Bold">Renal Effects </span><br>Long-term 
administration of NSAIDs has resulted in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4152839" conceptname="Acute papillary necrosis">renal papillary necrosis</span> and other 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4220631" conceptname="Injury of kidney">renal injury</span>. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal 
prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. 
In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may 
cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in 
renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at 
greatest risk of this reaction are those with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>, heart 
failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the

</span><br>REPREXAINâ„¢ contains hydrocodone, an opioid agonist, and is a Schedule 
III controlled substance. REPREXAINâ„¢, and other opioids used in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> can be 
abused and are subject to criminal diversion. <br>Addiction is a primary, 
chronic, neurobiologic disease, with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental 
factors influencing its development and manifestations. It is characterized by 
behaviors that include one or more of the following: impaired control over drug 
use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug addiction</span> is 
a treatable disease utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is 
common. <br>â€œDrug seekingâ€? behavior is very common in addicts and drug abusers. 
Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office 
hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated 
â€œlossâ€? of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide 
prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). 
â€œDoctor shoppingâ€? to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug 
abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. <br>Abuse and addiction 
are separate and distinct from physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> and tolerance. Physical 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> usually assumes clinically significant dimensions only after several 
weeks of continued opioid use, although a mild degree of physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> may 
develop after a few days of opioid therapy. Tolerance, in which increasingly 
large doses are required in order to produce the same degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, is 
manifested initially by a shortened duration of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span>, and 
subsequently by decreases in the intensity of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>. The rate of development 
of tolerance varies among patients. Physicians should be aware that abuse of 
opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction and is characterized by 
misuse for nonmedical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive 
substances. REPREXAINâ„¢, like other opioids, may be diverted for non-medical use. 
Record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and 
renewal requests is strongly advised. <br>Proper assessment of the patient, 
proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper 
dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of 
opioid drugs.</p>

naloxone hydrochloride should be administered intravenously with simultaneous 
efforts at respiratory resuscitation. Since the duration of action of 
hydrocodone may exceed that of the naloxone, the patient should be kept under 
continuous surveillance and repeated doses of the antagonist should be 
administered as needed to maintain adequate respiration. Supportive measures 
should be employed as indicated. Gastric emptying may be useful in removing 
unabsorbed drug. In cases where consciousness is impaired it may be inadvisable 
to perform gastric lavage. If gastric lavage is performed, little drug will 
likely be recovered if more than an hour has elapsed since ingestion. Ibuprofen 
is acidic and is excreted in the urine; therefore, it may be beneficial to 
administer alkali and induce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span>. In addition to supportive measures the 
use of oral activated charcoal may help to reduce the absorption and

<a href="http://"></a>Information for Patients<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Patients should be informed of the following 
information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the 
course of ongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the 
REPREXAINâ„¢ Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed. 
</span><br>1. REPREXAINâ„¢ (hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets), like 
other opioid-containing analgesics, may impair mental and/or physical abilities 
required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a 
car or operating machinery; patients should be cautioned accordingly. <br>2. 
Alcohol and other CNS depressants may produce an additive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span>, when 
taken with this combination product, and should be avoided. <br>3. REPREXAINâ„¢ 
(hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets) can be abused in a manner similar 
to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. REPREXAINâ„¢ may be habit-forming. 
Patients should take the drug only for as long as it is prescribed, in the 
amounts prescribed, and no more frequently than prescribed. <br>4. REPREXAINâ„¢, 
like other NSAID-containing products, may cause serious CV side effects, such as 
MI or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, which may result in hospitalization and even <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. Although 
serious CV events can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert 
for the signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77670" conceptname="Chest pain">chest pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">shortness of breath</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">weakness</span>, 
slurring of speech, and should ask for medical advice when observing any 
indicative sign or symptoms. Patients should be apprised of the importance of 
this follow-up (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS, Cardiovascular Effects</span>). 
<br>5. REPREXAINâ„¢, like other NSAID-containing products, can cause GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090431" conceptname="Discomfort">discomfort</span> 
and serious GI side effects, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcers</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, which may result in 
hospitalization and even <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the 
signs and symptoms of ulcerations and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, and should ask for medical 
advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194175" conceptname="Left upper quadrant pain">epigastric pain</span>, 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="23325" conceptname="Heartburn">dyspepsia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="193809" conceptname="Melena due to gastrointestinal hemorrhage">melena</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="26727" conceptname="Hematemesis">hematemesis</span>. Patients should be apprised of the 
importance of this follow-up (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS, Gastrointestinal 
Effects: Risk of Ulceration, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">Bleeding</span>, and Perforation</span>). <br>6. 
REPREXAINâ„¢, like other NSAID-containing products, can cause serious skin side 
effects such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4270887" conceptname="Erythroderma">exfoliative dermatitis</span>, SJS, and TEN, which may result in 
hospitalizations and even <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. Although serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089139" conceptname="Skin reaction">skin reactions</span> may occur 
without warning, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of skin 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443720" conceptname="Blister">blisters</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, or other signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302654" conceptname="Itching">itching</span>, 
and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or 
symptoms. Patients should be advised to stop the drug immediately if they 
develop any type of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> and contact their physicians as soon as possible. 
<br>7. Patients should promptly report signs or symptoms of unexplained weight 
gain or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span> to their physicians. <br>8. Patients should be informed of the 
warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4061577" conceptname="Lethargy">lethargy</span>, 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span>, right upper quadrant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4082445" conceptname="Tenderness">tenderness</span>, and â€œflu-likeâ€? symptoms). 
If these occur, patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate 
medical therapy. <br>9. Patients should be informed of the signs of an 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4148381" conceptname="Anaphylactoid reaction">anaphylactoid reaction</span> (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">difficulty breathing</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span> of the face or 
throat). If these occur, patients should be instructed to seek immediate 
emergency help (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>). <br>10. In late 
pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, REPREXAINâ„¢ should be avoided because it may 
cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. <br>11. Patients should be 
instructed to report any signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079185" conceptname="Hazy vision">blurred vision</span> or other eye symptoms. 
<br></p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Laboratory Tests<p>Because serious GI tract ulcerations and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> can occur 
without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs should have their CBC and 
a chemistry profile checked periodically. If clinical signs and symptoms 
consistent with liver or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span> develop, systemic manifestations occur 
(e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302954" conceptname="Disorder characterized by eosinophilia">eosinophilia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>, etc.) or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, 
REPREXAINâ„¢ should be discontinued. <br></p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Drug Interactions<span class="Underline">ACE-inhibitors</span>: Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish 
the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given 
consideration in patients taking REPREXAINâ„¢ concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors. 
<br><span class="Underline">Anticholinergics</span>: The concurrent use of 
anticholinergics with hydrocodone preparations may produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192357" conceptname="Paralytic ileus">paralytic ileus</span>. 
<br><span class="Underline">Antidepressants</span>: The use of Monoamine Oxidase 
Inhibitors (MAOIs) or tricyclic antidepressants with REPREXAINâ„¢ may increase the 
effect of either the antidepressant or hydrocodone. <br>MAOIs have been reported 
to intensify the effects of at least one opioid drug causing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> 
and significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> of respiration or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>. The use of hydrocodone is not 
recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such 
treatment. <br><span class="Underline">Aspirin</span>: When REPREXAINâ„¢ is 
administered with aspirin, the protein binding of aspirin is reduced, although 
the clearance of free REPREXAINâ„¢ is not altered. The clinical significance of 
this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAID-containing products, 
concomitant administration of REPREXAINâ„¢ and aspirin is not generally 
recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects. <br><span class="Underline">CNS Depressants</span>: Patients receiving other opioids, 
antihistamines, antipsychotics, antianxiety agents, or other CNS depressants 
(including alcohol) concomitantly with REPREXAINâ„¢ may exhibit an additive CNS 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>. When combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both 
agents should be reduced. <br><span class="Underline">Diuretics</span>: Ibuprofen 
has been shown to reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in 
some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal 
prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with REPREXAINâ„¢Â  the patient 
should be observed closely for signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS - Renal Effects</span>), as well as diuretic efficacy. 
<br><span class="Underline">Lithium</span>: Ibuprofen has been shown to elevate 
plasma lithium concentration and reduce renal lithium clearance. The mean 
minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was 
decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to inhibition of 
renal prostaglandin synthesis by ibuprofen. Thus, when REPREXAINâ„¢ and lithium 
are administered concurrently, patients should be observed for signs of lithium 
toxicity. <br><span class="Underline">Methotrexate</span>: Ibuprofen, as well as 
other NSAIDs, has been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate 
accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that ibuprofen could 
enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when REPREXAINâ„¢ is 
administered concomitantly with methotrexate. <br><span class="Underline">Mixed 
Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics</span>: Agonist/antagonist analgesics 
(i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol and buprenorphine) should be 
administered with caution to patients who have received or are receiving a 
course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as hydrocodone. In 
this situation, mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic 
effect of hydrocodone and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these 
patients. <br><span class="Underline">Neuromuscular Blocking Agents</span>: 
Hydrocodone, as well as other opioid analgesics, may enhance the neuromuscular 
blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>. <br><span class="Underline">Warfarin</span>: The effects 
of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> are synergistic, such that users of both 
drugs together have a risk of serious GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> higher than users of either 
drug alone. <br><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Carcinogenesis, Mutangenicity, and Impairment of 
Fertility<p>Â <br>The carcinogenic and mutagenic potential of REPREXAINâ„¢ has 
not been investigated. The ability of REPREXAINâ„¢ to impair fertility has not 
been assessed. <br><br></p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pregnancy<p>Pregnancy Category C. <br><span class="Underline">Teratogenic 
Effects</span>: Reproductive studies conducted in rats and rabbits have not 
demonstrated evidence of developmental abnormalities. <br></p>
<p>REPREXAINâ„¢, administered to rabbits at 95 mg/kg (5.72 and 1.9 times the 
maximum clinical dose based on body weight and surface area, respectively), a 
maternally toxic dose, resulted in an increase in the percentage of litters and 
fetuses with any major abnormality and an increase in the number of litters and 
fetuses with one or more nonossified metacarpals (a minor abnormality). 
REPREXAINâ„¢, administered to rats at 166 mg/kg (10.0 and 1.66 times the maximum 
clinical dose based on body weight and surface area, respectively), a maternally 
toxic dose, did not result in any reproductive toxicity. However, animal 
reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. There are no 
adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. REPREXAINâ„¢ should be 
used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk 
to the fetus. <br><span class="Underline">Nonteratogenic Effects</span>: Because 
of the known effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the fetal 
cardiovascular system (closure of the ductus arteriosus), use during pregnancy 
(particularly late pregnancy) should be avoided. Babies born to mothers who have 
been taking opioids regularly prior to delivery will be physically dependent. 
The withdrawal signs include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span> and excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4136768" conceptname="Crying">crying</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremors</span>, 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">hyperactive</span> reflexes, increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4313591" conceptname="Respiratory rate">respiratory rate</span>, increased stools, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4328356" conceptname="Sneezing">sneezing</span>, 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089239" conceptname="Yawning">yawning</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>. The intensity of the syndrome does not always 
correlate with the duration of maternal opioid use or dose. There is no 
consensus on the best method of managing withdrawal. <br><br></p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Labor and Delivery<p><br>Labor and Delivery <br>As with other drugs known to inhibit 
prostaglandin synthesis, an increased incidence of dystocia and delayed 
parturition occurred in rats. Administration of REPREXAINâ„¢ is not recommended 
during labor and delivery. The effects of REPREXAINâ„¢ on labor and delivery in 
pregnant women are unknown. <br><br><br></p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Nursing Mothers<p>It is not known whether hydrocodone is excreted in human milk. In 
limited studies, an assay capable of detecting 1 mcg/mL did not demonstrate 
ibuprofen in the milk of lactating mothers. However, because of the limited 
nature of the studies, and because of the potential for serious adverse 
reactions in nursing infants from REPREXAINâ„¢, a decision should be made whether 
to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the 
importance of the drug to the mother. <br></p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pediatric Use<p>The safety and effectiveness of REPREXAINâ„¢ in pediatric patients 
below the age of 16 have not been established.<br></p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Geriatric Use<p>In controlled clinical trials there was no difference in 
tolerability between patients less than 65 years of age and those more than or 
equal to 65, apart from an increased tendency of the elderly to develop 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">constipation</span>. However, because the elderly may be more sensitive to the renal 
and gastrointestinal effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents as well as 
possible increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> with opioids, extra caution 
and reduced dosages should be used when treating the elderly with REPREXAINâ„¢Â  
(hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets).</p>
