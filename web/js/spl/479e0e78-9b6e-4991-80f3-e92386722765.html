<h1><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span></h1>
<p class="First">Levocarnitine is a naturally occurring substance required in mammalian energy metabolism. It has been shown to facilitate long-chain fatty acid entry into cellular mitochondria, thereby delivering substrate for oxidation and subsequent energy production. Fatty acids are utilized as an energy substrate in all tissues except the brain. In skeletal and cardiac muscle, fatty acids are the main substrate for energy production.</p>
<p>Primary systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228429" conceptname="Carnitine deficiency">carnitine deficiency</span> is characterized by low concentrations of levocarnitine in plasma, RBC, and/or tissues. It has not been possible to determine which symptoms are due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228429" conceptname="Carnitine deficiency">carnitine deficiency</span> and which are due to an underlying organic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidemia</span>, as symptoms of both abnormalities may be expected to improve with levocarnitine. The literature reports that carnitine can promote the excretion of excess organic or fatty acids in patients with defects in fatty acid metabolism and/or specific organic acidopathies that bioaccumulate acylCoA esters.<span class="Sup">1-6</span></p>
<p>Secondary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228429" conceptname="Carnitine deficiency">carnitine deficiency</span> can be a consequence of inborn errors of metabolism. Levocarnitine may alleviate the metabolic abnormalities of patients with inborn errors that result in accumulation of toxic organic acids. Conditions for which this effect has been demonstrated are: glutaric aciduria ll, methyl malonic aciduria, propionic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidemia</span>, and medium chain fatty acylCoA dehydrogenase deficiency.<span class="Sup">7</span>,<span class="Sup">8</span> Autointoxication occurs in these patients due to the accumulation of acylCoA compounds that disrupt intermediary metabolism. The subsequent hydrolysis of the acylCoA compound to its free acid results in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidosis</span> which can be life-threatening. Levocarnitine clears the acylCoA compound by formation of acylcarnitine, which is quickly excreted. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228429" conceptname="Carnitine deficiency">Carnitine deficiency</span> is defined biochemically as abnormally low plasma concentrations of free carnitine, less than 20 Î¼mol/L at one week post term and may be associated with low tissue and/or urine concentrations. Further, this condition may be associated with a plasma concentration ratio of acylcarnitine/levocarnitine greater than 0.4 or abnormally elevated concentrations of acylcarnitine in the urine. In premature infants and newborns, secondary deficiency is defined as plasma levocarnitine concentrations below age-related normal concentrations.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">PHARMACOKINETICS</span></h1>
<p class="First">In a relative bioavailability study in 15 healthy adult male volunteers, levocarnitine tablets were found to be bio-equivalent to levocarnitine oral solution. Following 4 days of dosing with 6 tablets of levocarnitine 330 mg b.i.d. or 2 g of levocarnitine oral solution b.i.d., the maximum plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) was about 80 Î¼mol/L and the time to maximum plasma concentration (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) occurred at 3.3 hours.</p>
<p>The plasma concentration profiles of levocarnitine after a slow 3 minute intravenous bolus dose of 20 mg/kg of levocarnitine were described by a two-compartment model. Following a single i.v. administration, approximately 76% of the levocarnitine dose was excreted in the urine during the 0 -24h interval. Using plasma concentrations uncorrected for endogenous levocarnitine, the mean distribution half life was 0.585 hours and the mean apparent terminal elimination half life was 17.4 hours.</p>
<p>The absolute bioavailability of levocarnitine from theÂ one oral formulation of levocarnitine, calculated after correction for circulating endogenous plasma concentrations of levocarnitine, was 15.1 Â± 5.3% for levocarnitine tablets.</p>
<p>Total body clearance of levocarnitine (Dose/AUC including endogenous baseline concentrations) was a mean of 4.00 L/h.</p>
<p>Levocarnitine was not bound to plasma protein or albumin when tested at any concentration or with any species including the human.<span class="Sup">9</span></p>

<h1><span class="Bold">METABOLISM AND EXCRETION</span></h1>
<p class="First">In a pharmacokinetic study where five normal adult male volunteers received an oral dose of [<span class="Sup">3</span>H-methyl]-L-carnitine following 15 days of a high carnitine diet and additional carnitine supplement, 58 to 65% of the administered radioactive dose was recovered in the urine and feces in 5 to 11 days. Maximum concentration of [<span class="Sup">3</span>H-methyl]-L-carnitine in serum occurred from 2.0 to 4.5 hr after drug administration. Major metabolites found were trimethylamine N-oxide, primarily in urine (8% to 49% of the administered dose) and [<span class="Sup">3</span>H]-Î³-butyrobetaine, primarily in feces (0.44% to 45% of the administered dose). Urinary excretion of levocarnitine was about 4 to 8% of the dose. Fecal excretion of total carnitine was less than 1% of the administered dose.<span class="Sup">10</span></p>
<p>After attainment of steady state following 4 days of oral administration of levocarnitine tablets (1980 mg q12h) to 15 healthy male volunteers, the mean urinary excretion of levocarnitine during a single dosing interval (12h) was about 9% of the orally administered dose (uncorrected for endogenous urinary excretion).</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers</span></h2>
<p class="First">Levocarnitine supplementation in nursing mothers has not been specifically studied.</p>
<p>Studies in dairy cows indicate that the concentration of levocarnitine in milk is increased following exogenous administration of levocarnitine. In nursing mothers receiving levocarnitine, any risks to the child of excess carnitine intake need to be weighed against the benefits of levocarnitine supplementation to the mother.
