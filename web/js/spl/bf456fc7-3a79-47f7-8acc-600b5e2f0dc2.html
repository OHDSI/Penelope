<h1><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION</span></h1>
<p class="First">MYLERAN (busulfan) is a bifunctional alkylating agent. Busulfan is known chemically as 1,4-butanediol dimethanesulfonate and has the following structural formula:</p>
<p>CH<span class="Sub">3</span>SO<span class="Sub">2</span>O(CH<span class="Sub">2</span>)<span class="Sub">4</span>OSO<span class="Sub">2</span>CH<span class="Sub">3</span></p>
<p>Busulfan is <span class="Italics">not </span>a structural analog of the nitrogen mustards. MYLERAN is available in tablet form for oral administration. Each film-coated tablet contains 2Â mg busulfan and the inactive ingredients hypromellose, lactose (anhydrous), magnesium stearate, pregelatinized starch, triacetin, and titanium dioxide.</p>
<p>The activity of busulfan in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134603" conceptname="Chronic myeloid leukemia">chronic myelogenous leukemia</span> was first reported by D.A.G. Galton in 1953.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span></h1>
<p class="First">Busulfan is a small, highly lipophilic molecule that easily crosses the blood brain barrier. Following absorption, 32% and 47% of busulfan are bound to plasma proteins and red blood cells, respectively. </p>
<p>Busulfan absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is essentially complete. This has been demonstrated in radioactive studies after both intravenous and oral administration of <span class="Sup">35</span>S-busulfan, <span class="Sup">14</span>C-busulfan, and <span class="Sup">3</span>H-busulfan. Following intravenous administration of a single therapeutic dose of <span class="Sup">35</span>S-busulfan, there was rapid disappearance of radioactivity from the blood and 90% to 95% of the <span class="Sup">35</span>S-label disappeared within 3 to 5Â minutes after injection. After either oral or intravenous administration of <span class="Sup">35</span>S-busulfan, 45% to 60% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine in the 48Â hours after administration; the majority of the total urinary excretion occurring in the first 24Â hours. Over 95% of the urinary <span class="Sup">35</span>S-label occurs as <span class="Sup">35</span>S-methanesulfonic acid. Oral and intravenous administration of 1,4-<span class="Sup">14</span>C-busulfan showed the same rapid initial disappearance of plasma radioactivity as observed following the administration of <span class="Sup">35</span>S-labeled drug. Cumulative radioactivity in the urine after 48Â hours was 25% to 30% of the administered dose (contrasting with 45% to 60% for <span class="Sup">35</span>S-busulfan), and suggests a slower excretion of the alkylating portion of the molecule and its metabolites than for the sulfonoxymethyl moieties. Regardless of the route of administration, 1,4-<span class="Sup">14</span>C-busulfan yielded a complex mixture of at least 12Â radiolabeled metabolites in urine; the main metabolite being 3-hydroxytetrahydrothiophene-1,1-dioxide. Pharmacokinetic studies employing <span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">3</span></span>H-busulfan labeled on the tetramethylene chain confirmed a rapid initial clearance of the radioactivity from plasma, irrespective of whether the drug was given orally or intravenously. </p>
<p>A study compared a 2-mg single IV bolus injection to a single oral dose of a 2-mg tablet of nonradioactive busulfan in 8Â adult patients 13 to 60Â years of age. The study demonstrated that the mean Â± SD absolute bioavailability was 80%Â Â±Â 20% in adults. However, the absolute bioavailability for 8 children 1.5 to 6Â years of age was 68% Â±Â 31%.</p>
<p>In another study of 2, 4, and 6Â mg of busulfan, given as a single oral dose on consecutive days (starting with the lowest dose) in 5Â adult patients, the mean dose-normalized (to 2Â mg dose) area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was about 130Â ngâ€¢hr/mL, while the mean intra- and inter-patient variability was about 16% and 21%, respectively. Busulfan was eliminated with a plasma terminal elimination half-life (t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>) of about 2.6Â hours, and demonstrated linear kinetics within the range of 2 to 6Â mg for both the maximum plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) and AUC. The mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> for the 2-, 4-, and 6-mg doses (after dose normalization to 2 mg) was about 30Â ng/mL. A recent study of 4 to 8Â mg as single oral doses in 12 patients showed that the mean Â± SD C<span class="Sub">max</span> (after dose normalization to 4 mg) was 68.2Â Â±Â 24.4Â ng/mL, occurring at about 0.9Â hours and the mean Â± SD AUC (after dose normalization to 4 mg) was 269Â Â±Â 62Â ngâ€¢hr/mL. These results are consistent with previous results. In addition, the mean Â±Â SD elimination half-life was 2.69Â Â±Â 0.49Â hours. </p>
<p>The elimination of busulfan appears to be independent of renal function. This probably reflects the extensive metabolism of the drug in the liver, since less than 2% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine unchanged within 24Â hours. The drug is metabolized by enzymatic activity to at least 12Â metabolites, among which tetrahydrothiophene, tetrahydrothiophene 12-oxide, sulfolane, and 3-hydroxysulfolane were identified. These metabolites do not have cytotoxic activity.</p>
<p>There is no experience with the use of dialysis in an attempt to modify the clinical toxicity of busulfan. One technical difficulty would derive from the extremely poor water solubility of busulfan. Additionally, all studies of the metabolism of busulfan employing radiolabeled materials indicate rapid chemical reactivity of the parent compound with prolonged retention of some of the metabolites (particularly the metabolites arising from the â€œalkylatingâ€? portion of the molecule). The effectiveness of dialysis at removing significant quantities of unreacted drug would be expected to be minimal in such a situation.</p>
<p>Currently, there are no available data on the effect of food on busulfan bioavailability.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics in Hemodialysis Patients</span></h2>
<p class="First">The impact of hemodialysis on the clearance of busulfan was determined in a patient with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198185" conceptname="Chronic renal failure">chronic renal failure</span> undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation. The apparent oral clearance of busulfan during a 4-hour hemodialysis session was increased by 65%, but the 24-hour oral clearance of busulfan was increased by only 11%.</p>
<p>The incidence of veno-occlusive disease was higher (33.3% versus 3.0%) in patients with busulfan AUC<span class="Sub">0-6hr</span> &gt;1,500Â Î¼M.min (C<span class="Sub">ss</span> &gt;900Â mcg/L) compared to patients with busulfan AUC<span class="Sub">0-6hr</span> &lt;1,500Â Î¼M.min (C<span class="Sub">ss</span> &lt;900Â mcg/L) (see WARNINGS).</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></h2>
<p class="First">Itraconazole reduced busulfan clearance by up to 25% in patients receiving itraconazole compared to patients who did not receive itraconazole. Higher busulfan exposure due to concomitant itraconazole could lead to toxic plasma levels in some patients. Fluconazole had no effect on the clearance of busulfan. Patients treated with concomitant cyclophosphamide and busulfan with phenytoin pretreatment have increased cyclophosphamide and busulfan clearance, which may lead to decreased concentrations of both cyclophosphamide and busulfan. However, busulfan clearance may be reduced in the presence of cyclophosphamide alone, presumably due to competition for glutathione.</p>
<p>Diazepam had no effect on the clearance of busulfan.</p>
<p>No information is available regarding the penetration of busulfan into brain or cerebrospinal fluid.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Biochemical Pharmacology</span></h2>
<p class="First">In aqueous media, busulfan undergoes a wide range of nucleophilic substitution reactions. While this chemical reactivity is relatively non-specific, alkylation of the DNA is felt to be an important biological mechanism for its cytotoxic effect. Coliphage T7 exposed to busulfan was found to have the DNA crosslinked by intrastrand crosslinkages, but no interstrand linkages were found.</p>
<p>The metabolic fate of busulfan has been studied in rats and humans using <span class="Sup">14</span>C- and <span class="Sup">35</span>S-labeled materials. In humans, as in the rat, almost all of the radioactivity in <span class="Sup">35</span>S-labeled busulfan is excreted in the urine in the form of <span class="Sup">35</span>S-methanesulfonic acid. Roberts and Warwick demonstrated that the formation of methanesulfonic acid in vivo in the rat is not due to a simple hydrolysis of busulfan to 1,4-butanediol, since only about 4% of 2,3-<span class="Sup">14</span>C-busulfan was excreted as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135927" conceptname="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</span>, whereas 2,3-<span class="Sup">14</span>C-1,4-butanediol was converted almost exclusively to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135927" conceptname="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</span>. The predominant reaction of busulfan in the rat is the alkylation of sulfhydryl groups (particularly cysteine and cysteine-containing compounds) to produce a cyclic sulfonium compound which is the precursor of the major urinary metabolite of the 4-carbon portion of the molecule, 3-hydroxytetrahydrothiophene-1,1-dioxide. This has been termed a â€œsulfur-strippingâ€? action of busulfan and it may modify the function of certain sulfur-containing amino acids, polypeptides, and proteins; whether this action makes an important contribution to the cytotoxicity of busulfan is unknown.</p>
<p>The biochemical basis for acquired resistance to busulfan is largely a matter of speculation. Although altered transport of busulfan into the cell is one possibility, increased intracellular inactivation of the drug before it reaches the DNA is also possible. Experiments with other alkylating agents have shown that resistance to this class of compounds may reflect an acquired ability of the resistant cell to repair alkylation damage more effectively.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Clinical Studies</span></h2>
<p class="First">Although not curative, busulfan reduces the total granulocyte <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span>, relieves symptoms of the disease, and improves the clinical state of the patient. Approximately 90% of adults with previously untreated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134603" conceptname="Chronic myeloid leukemia">chronic myelogenous leukemia</span> will obtain hematologic remission with regression or stabilization of organomegaly following the use of busulfan. It has been shown to be superior to splenic irradiation with respect to survival times and maintenance of hemoglobin levels, and to be equivalent to irradiation at controlling <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200527" conceptname="Splenomegaly">splenomegaly</span>.</p>
<p>It is not clear whether busulfan unequivocally prolongs the survival of responding patients beyond the 31Â months experienced by an untreated group of historical controls. Median survival figures of 31 to 42Â months have been reported for several groups of patients treated with busulfan, but concurrent control groups of comparable, untreated patients are not available. The median survival figures reported from different studies will be influenced by the percentage of â€œpoor riskâ€? patients initially entered into the particular study. Patients who are alive 2Â years following the diagnosis of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134603" conceptname="Chronic myeloid leukemia">chronic myelogenous leukemia</span>, and who have been treated during that period with busulfan, are estimated to have a mean annual mortality rate during the second to fifth year which is approximately two thirds that of patients who received either no treatment, conventional x-ray or <span class="Sup">32</span>P-irradiation, or chemotherapy with minimally active drugs.</p>
<p>Busulfan is clearly less effective in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134603" conceptname="Chronic myeloid leukemia">chronic myelogenous leukemia</span> who lack the Philadelphia (Ph<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">1</span></span>) chromosome. Also, the so-called â€œjuvenileâ€? type of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134603" conceptname="Chronic myeloid leukemia">chronic myelogenous leukemia</span>, typically occurring in young children and associated with the absence of a Philadelphia chromosome, responds poorly to busulfan. The drug is of no benefit in patients whose <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134603" conceptname="Chronic myeloid leukemia">chronic myelogenous leukemia</span> has entered a â€œblasticâ€? phase.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span></h1>
<p class="First">The most frequent, serious side effect of treatment with busulfan is the induction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432881" conceptname="Pancytopenia">bone marrow failure</span> (which may or may not be anatomically hypoplastic) resulting in severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432881" conceptname="Pancytopenia">pancytopenia</span>. The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432881" conceptname="Pancytopenia">pancytopenia</span> caused by busulfan may be more prolonged than that induced with other alkylating agents. It is generally felt that the usual cause of busulfan-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432881" conceptname="Pancytopenia">pancytopenia</span> is the failure to stop administration of the drug soon enough; individual idiosyncrasy to the drug does not seem to be an important factor. <span class="Italics">MYLERAN should be used with extreme caution and exceptional vigilance in patients whose bone marrow reserve may have been compromised by prior irradiation or chemotherapy, or whose marrow function is recovering from previous cytotoxic therapy.</span> Although recovery from busulfan-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432881" conceptname="Pancytopenia">pancytopenia</span> may take from 1Â month to 2Â years, this complication is potentially reversible, and the patient should be vigorously supported through any period of severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432881" conceptname="Pancytopenia">pancytopenia</span>.</p>
<p>A rare, important complication of busulfan therapy is the development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4283942" conceptname="Bronchopulmonary dysplasia of newborn">bronchopulmonary dysplasia</span> with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4197819" conceptname="Fibrosis of lung">pulmonary fibrosis</span>. Symptoms have been reported to occur within 8Â months to 10Â years after initiation of therapyâ€”the average duration of therapy being 4Â years. The histologic findings associated with â€œbusulfan lungâ€? mimic those seen following pulmonary irradiation. Clinically, patients have reported the insidious onset of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">dyspnea</span>, and low-grade <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>. In some cases, however, onset of symptoms may be acute. Pulmonary function studies have revealed diminished diffusion capacity and decreased pulmonary compliance. It is important to exclude more common conditions (such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4247535" conceptname="Opportunistic infectious disease">opportunistic infections</span> or leukemic infiltration of the lungs) with appropriate diagnostic techniques. If measures such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4102774" conceptname="Productive cough">sputum</span> cultures, virologic studies, and exfoliative <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="45771295" conceptname="Cytology">cytology</span> fail to establish an etiology for the pulmonary infiltrates, lung biopsy may be necessary to establish the diagnosis. Treatment of established busulfan-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4197819" conceptname="Fibrosis of lung">pulmonary fibrosis</span> is unsatisfactory; in most cases the patients have died within 6Â months after the diagnosis was established. There is no specific therapy for this complication. MYLERAN should be discontinued if this lung toxicity develops. The administration of corticosteroids has been suggested, but the results have not been impressive or uniformly successful.</p>
<p>Busulfan may cause cellular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4093447" conceptname="Dysplasia">dysplasia</span> in many organs in addition to the lung. Cytologic abnormalities characterized by giant, hyperchromatic nuclei have been reported in lymph nodes, pancreas, thyroid, adrenal glands, liver, and bone marrow. This cytologic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4093447" conceptname="Dysplasia">dysplasia</span> may be severe enough to cause difficulty in interpretation of exfoliative cytologic examinations from the lung, bladder, breast, and the uterine cervix.</p>
<p>In addition to the widespread epithelial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4093447" conceptname="Dysplasia">dysplasia</span> that has been observed during busulfan therapy, chromosome aberrations have been reported in cells from patients receiving busulfan.</p>
<p>Busulfan is mutagenic in mice and, possibly, in humans.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197506" conceptname="Malignant neoplasm of abdomen">Malignant tumors</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138708" conceptname="Acute leukemia">acute leukemias</span> have been reported in patients who have received busulfan therapy, and this drug may be a human carcinogen. The World Health Organization has concluded that there is a causal relationship between busulfan exposure and the development of secondary malignancies. Four cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138708" conceptname="Acute leukemia">acute leukemia</span> occurred among 243Â patients treated with busulfan as adjuvant chemotherapy following surgical resection of bronchogenic carcinoma. All 4 cases were from a subgroup of 19 of these 243Â patients who developed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432881" conceptname="Pancytopenia">pancytopenia</span> while taking busulfan 5 to 8 years before <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315497" conceptname="Subacute leukemia">leukemia</span> became clinically apparent. These findings suggest that busulfan is leukemogenic, although its mode of action is uncertain.</p>

Busulfan has been associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="193739" conceptname="Ovarian failure">ovarian failure</span> including failure to achieve puberty in females. Busulfan interferes with spermatogenesis in experimental animals, and there have been clinical reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4035976" conceptname="Sterility">sterility</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="76744" conceptname="Azoospermia">azoospermia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438477" conceptname="Atrophy of testis">testicular atrophy</span> in male patients.</p>
<p>Hepatic veno-occlusive disease, which may be life threatening, has been reported in patients receiving busulfan, usually in combination with cyclophosphamide or other chemotherapeutic agents prior to bone marrow transplantation. Possible risk factors for the development of hepatic veno-occlusive disease include: total busulfan dose exceeding 16Â mg/kg based on ideal body weight, and concurrent use of multiple alkylating agents (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and Drug Interactions).</p>
<p>A clear cause-and-effect relationship with busulfan has not been demonstrated. Periodic measurement of serum transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin is indicated for early detection of hepatotoxicity. A reduced incidence of hepatic veno-occlusive disease and other regimen-related toxicities have been observed in patients treated with high-dose MYLERAN and cyclophosphamide when the first dose of cyclophosphamide has been delayed for &gt;24Â hours after the last dose of busulfan (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and Drug Interactions).</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Pregnancy</span></h2>
<p class="First">Pregnancy Category D. Busulfan may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Although there have been a number of cases reported where apparently normal children have been born after busulfan treatment during pregnancy, one case has been cited where a malformed baby was delivered by a mother treated with busulfan. During the pregnancy that resulted in the malformed infant, the mother received x-ray therapy early in the first trimester, mercaptopurine until the third month, then busulfan until delivery. In pregnant rats, busulfan produces <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4035976" conceptname="Sterility">sterility</span> in both male and female offspring due to the absence of germinal cells in testes and ovaries.

A decision to increase, decrease, continue, or discontinue a given dose of busulfan must be based not only on the absolute hematologic values, but also on the rapidity with which changes are occurring. The dosage of busulfan may need to be reduced if this agent is combined with other drugs whose primary toxicity is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4145241" conceptname="Bone marrow depression">myelosuppression</span>.

<p class="First">Busulfan may cause additive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4145241" conceptname="Bone marrow depression">myelosuppression</span> when used with other myelosuppressive drugs.</p>

Duration of combination therapy prior to the appearance of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24966" conceptname="Esophageal varices">esophageal varices</span> ranged from 6 to 45Â months. With the present analysis of the data, no cases of hepatotoxicity have appeared in the busulfan-alone arm of the study. Long-term continuous therapy with thioguanine and busulfan should be used with caution.</p>
<p>Busulfan-induced pulmonary toxicity may be additive to the effects produced by other cytotoxic agents.</p>
<p>The concomitant systemic administration of itraconazole to patients receiving high-dose MYLERAN may result in reduced busulfan clearance (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Patients should be monitored for signs of busulfan toxicity when itraconazole is used concomitantly with MYLERAN. </p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Geriatric Use</span></h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of busulfan did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span></h1>
<p class="First">Busulfan is administered orally. The usual adult dose range for <span class="Italics">remission induction</span> is 4 to 8Â mg, total dose, daily. Dosing on a weight basis is the same for both pediatric patients and adults, approximately 60Â mcg/kg of body weight or 1.8Â mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> of body surface, daily. Since the rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> of the leukocyte count is dose related, daily doses exceeding 4Â mg per day should be reserved for patients with the most compelling symptoms; the greater the total daily dose, the greater is the possibility of inducing bone marrow <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4166825" conceptname="Aplasia">aplasia</span>.</p>
<p>A decrease in the leukocyte count is not usually seen during the first 10 to 15Â days of treatment; the leukocyte count may actually increase during this period and it should not be interpreted as resistance to the drug, nor should the dose be increased. Since the leukocyte count may continue to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> for more than 1Â month after discontinuing the drug, it is important that busulfan be discontinued <span class="Italics">prior</span> to the total leukocyte count <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falling</span> into the normal range. When the total leukocyte count has declined to approximately 15,000/mcL, the drug should be withheld.</p>
<p>With a constant dose of busulfan, the total leukocyte count declines exponentially; a weekly plot of the leukocyte count on semi-logarithmic graph paper aids in predicting the time when therapy should be discontinued. With the recommended dose of busulfan, a normal leukocyte count is usually achieved in 12 to 20Â weeks.</p>
<p>During remission, the patient is examined at monthly intervals and treatment resumed with the induction dosage when the total leukocyte count reaches approximately 50,000/mcL. When remission is shorter than 3Â months, maintenance therapy of 1 to 3Â mg daily may be advisable in order to keep the hematological status under control and prevent rapid relapse.</p>
<p>Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should be considered. Several guidelines on this subject have been published.<span class="Sup">1-8</span></p>
<p>There is no general agreement that all of the procedures recommended in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate.</p>
