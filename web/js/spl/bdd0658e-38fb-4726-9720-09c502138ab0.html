<a name="section-5.1"></a><p></p>
<h2><span class="Bold">Reserpine</span></h2>
<p class="First">Reserpine depletes stores of catecholamines and 5-hydroxytryptamine in many organs, including the brain and adrenal medulla. Most of its pharmacological effects have been attributed to this action. Depletion is slower and less complete in the adrenal medulla than in other tissues. </p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â 
	The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> of sympathetic nerve function results in a decreased heart rate and a lowering of arterial blood pressure. The sedative and tranquilizing properties of reserpine are thought to be related to depletion of catecholamines and 5-hydroxytryptamine from the brain. </p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â 
	Reserpine, like other rauwolfia compounds, is characterized by slow onset of action and sustained effects. Both cardiovascular and central nervous system effects may persist for a period of time following withdrawal of the drug. </p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â 
	Mean maximum plasma levels of 1.54 ng/ml were attained after a median of 3.5 hours in six normal subjects receiving a single oral dose of four 0.25-mg Serpasil tablets.</p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â 
	Bioavailability was approximately 50% of that of a corresponding intravenous dose. Plasma levels of reserpine after intravenous administration declined with a mean half-life of 33 hours. Reserpine is extensively bound (96%) to plasma proteins. No definitive studies on the human metabolism of reserpine have been made. </p>

<a name="section-5.2"></a><p></p>
<h2><span class="Bold">Hydralazine </span></h2>
<p class="First">Although the precise mechanism of action of hydralazine is not fully understood, the major effects are on the cardiovascular system. Hydralazine apparently lowers blood pressure by exerting a peripheral vasodilating effect through a direct relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Hydralazine, by altering cellular calcium metabolism, interferes with the calcium movements within the vascular smooth muscle that are responsible for initiating or maintaining the contractile state.</p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â 
	The peripheral vasodilating effect of hydralazine results in decreased arterial blood pressure (diastolic more than systolic); decreased peripheral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span>; and an increased heart rate, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4231869" conceptname="Stroke volume">stroke volume</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span>. The preferential dilatation of arterioles, as compared to veins, minimizes <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span> and promotes the increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span>. Hydralazine usually increases renin activity in plasma, presumably as a result of increased secretion of renin by the renal juxtaglomerular cells in response to reflex sympathetic discharge. This increase in renin activity leads to the production of angiotensin II, which then causes stimulation of aldosterone and consequent sodium reabsorption. Hydralazine also maintains or increases renal and cerebral blood flow. </p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â 
	Hydralazine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, and peak plasma levels are reached at 1-2 hours. Plasma levels decline with a half-life of 3-7 hours. Binding to human plasma protein is 87%. Plasma levels of hydralazine vary widely among individuals. Hydralazine is subject to polymorphic acetylation; slow acetylators generally have higher plasma levels of hydralazine and require lower doses to maintain control of blood pressure. Hydralazine undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism; it is excreted mainly in the form of metabolites in the urine. </p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â 
	Administration of hydralazine with food results in higher levels of the drug in plasma.</p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-5.3"></a><p></p>
<h2><span class="Bold">Hydrochlorothiazide</span></h2>
<p class="First">Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanism of electrolyte reabsorption. At maximal therapeutic dosage, all thiazides are approximately equal in their diuretic potency. Thiazides increase excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Natriuresis causes a secondary loss of potassium. </p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â 
	The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown. Thiazides do not affect normal blood pressure. </p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â 
	The onset of action of thiazides occurs in 2 hours, and the peak effect at about 4 hours. The action persists for approximately 6-12 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide is rapidly absorbed, as indicated by peak plasma concentrations 1-2.5 hours after oral administration. Plasma levels of the drug are proportional to dose; the concentration in whole blood is 1.6-1.8 times higher than in plasma. Thiazides are eliminated rapidly by the kidney. After oral administration of 25- to 100-mg doses of hydrochlorothiazide, 72%-97% of the dose is excreted in the urine, indicating dose-independent absorption. Hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated from plasma in a biphasic fashion with a terminal half-life of 10-17 hours. Plasma protein binding is 67.9%. Plasma clearance is 15.9-30.0 L/hr; volume of distribution is 3.6-7.8 L/kg. </p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â 
	Gastrointestinal absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is enhanced when administered with food. Absorption is decreased in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>, and the pharmacokinetics are considerably different in these patients.</p>

<p>Â Â Â Â Â 
	Preoperative withdrawal of reserpine does not assure that circulatory instability will not occur. It is important that the anesthesiologist be aware of the patientâ€™s drug intake and consider this in the overall management, since <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> has occurred in patients receiving rauwolfia preparations.

<p>Â Â Â Â Â 
	The â€œhyperdynamicâ€? circulation caused by hydralazine may accentuate specific cardiovascular inadequacies. For example, hydralazine may increase pulmonary artery pressure in patients with mitral valvular disease.

<p>Â Â Â Â Â 
	In hypertensive patients with normal kidneys who are treated with hydralazine, there is evidence of increased renal blood flow and a maintenance of glomerular filtration rate. In some instances where control values were below normal, improved renal function has been noted after administration of hydralazine. However, as with any antihypertensive agent, hydralazine should be used with caution in patients with advanced renal damage. </p>

<h4>
<span class="Bold Italics">Animal </span><span class="Bold Italics">Tumorigenicity</span>
</h4>
<p class="First">Rodent studies have shown that reserpine is an animal tumorigen, causing an increased incidence of mammary fibroadenomas in female mice, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197506" conceptname="Malignant neoplasm of abdomen">malignant tumors</span> of the seminal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443720" conceptname="Blister">vesicles</span> in male mice, and malignant adrenal medullary tumors in male rats. These findings arose in 2-year studies in which the drug was administered in the feed at concentrations of 5 and 10 ppm-about 100 to 300 times the usual human dose. The breast neoplasms are thought to be related to reserpineâ€™s prolactin-elevating effect. Several other prolactin-elevating drugs have also been associated with an increased incidence of mammary neoplasia in rodents.</p>
<p>The extent to which these findings indicate a risk to humans is uncertain. Tissue culture experiments show that about one third of human breast tumors are prolactin-dependent in vitro, a factor of considerable importance if the use of the drug is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. The possibility of an increased risk of breast cancer in reserpine users has been studied extensively; however, no firm conclusion has emerged. Although a few epidemiologic studies have suggested a slightly increased risk (less than twofold in all studies except one) in women who have used reserpine, other studies of generally similar design have not confirmed this. Epidemiologic studies conducted using other drugs (neuroleptic agents) that, like reserpine, increase prolactin levels and therefore would be considered rodent mammary carcinogens have not shown an association between chronic administration of the drug and human mammary tumorigenesis. While long-term clinical observation has not suggested such an association, the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time. An association of reserpine intake with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118993" conceptname="Pheochromocytoma">pheochromocytoma</span> or tumors of the seminal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443720" conceptname="Blister">vesicles</span> has not been explored.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold Italics">Hydralazine</span></h3>
<p class="First">In a lifetime study in Swiss albino mice, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of lung tumors (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> and adenocarcinomas) of both male and female mice given hydralazine continuously in their drinking water at a dosage of about 250 mg/kg/ day (about 80 times the maximum recommended human dose). In a 2-year carcinogenicity study of rats given hydralazine by gavage at dose levels of 15, 30, and 60 mg/kg/day (approximately 5 to 20 times the recommended human daily dosage), microscopic examination of the liver revealed a small, but statistically significant, increase in benign neoplastic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4101098" conceptname="Nodule">nodules</span> in male and female rats from the high-dose group and in female rats from the intermediate-dose group. Benign interstitial cell tumors of the testes were also significantly increased in male rats from the high-dose group. The tumors observed are common in aged rats and a significantly increased incidence was not observed until 18 months of treatment. Hydralazine was shown to be mutagenic in bacterial systems (Gene Mutation and DNA Repair) and in one of two rat and one rabbit hepatocyte in vitro DNA repair studies. Additional in vivo and in vitro studies using <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> cells, germinal cells, and fibroblasts from mice, bone marrow cells from Chinese hamsters and fibroblasts from human cell lines did not demonstrate any mutagenic potential for hydralazine. </p>
<p>The extent to which these findings indicate a risk to man is uncertain. While long-term clinical observation has not suggested that human cancer is associated with hydralazine use, epidemiologic studies have so far been insufficient to arrive at any conclusions.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Treatment</span></h2>
<p class="First">There is no specific antidote.</p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â 
	The gastric contents should be evacuated, taking adequate precautions against <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span> and for protection of the airway. An activated charcoal slurry may be instilled if conditions permit. Dialysis may not be effective for elimination of Ser-Ap-Es because of its plasma protein binding (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).</p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â 
	These manipulations may have to be omitted or carried out after cardiovascular status has been stabilized, since they might precipitate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmias</span> or increase the depth of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span>.</p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â 
	If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span> occurs, the patient's legs should be kept raised and lost fluid and electrolytes (potassium, sodium) should be replaced.</p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â 
	Support of the cardiovascular system is of primary importance in suspected hydralazine overdosage. If possible, vasopressors should not be given, but if a vasopressor is required, care should be taken not to precipitate or aggravate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmia</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">Tachycardia</span> responds to beta blockers. Digitalization may be necessary.</p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â 
	If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> is severe enough to require treatment with a vasopressor, one having a direct action upon vascular smooth muscle (e.g., phenylephrine, levarterenol, metaraminol) should be used to treat the symptomatic effects of reserpine overdosage.</p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â 
	Fluid and electrolyte balance (especially serum potassium) and renal function should be monitored until conditions become normal. Since reserpine is long-acting, the patient should be observed carefully for at least 72 hours.</p>
