<p class="First"><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION: </span> Rovera (carprofen) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the propionic acid class that includes ibuprofen, naproxen, and ketoprofen. Carprofen is the nonproprietary designation for a substituted carbazole, 6-chloro-Î±-methyl-9H-carbazole-2-acetic acid. The empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">15</span>H<span class="Sub">12</span>ClNO<span class="Sub">2</span> and the molecular weight 273.72. The chemical structure of carprofen is:</p>

<p>Carprofen is a white, crystalline compound. It is freely soluble in ethanol, but practically insoluble in water at 25Â°C.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: </span>Carprofen is a non-narcotic, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent with characteristic analgesic and antipyretic activity approximately equipotent to indomethacin in animal models.<span class="Sup">1</span></p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="43679-0">
<a name="section-4.1"></a><p></p>
<p class="First">The mechanism of action of carprofen, like that of other NSAIDs, is believed to be associated with the inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity. Two unique cyclooxygenases have been described in mammals.<span class="Sup">2</span> The constitutive cyclooxygenase, COX-1, synthesizes prostaglandins necessary for normal gastrointestinal and renal function. The inducible cyclooxygenase, COX-2, generates prostaglandins involved in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span>. Inhibition of COX-1 is thought to be associated with gastrointestinal and renal toxicity while inhibition of COX-2 provides anti-inflammatory activity. The specificity of a particular NSAID for COX-2 versus COX-1 may vary from species to species.<span class="Sup">3</span> In an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> study using canine cell cultures, carprofen demonstrated selective inhibition of COX-2 versus COX-1.<span class="Sup">4</span> Clinical relevance of these data has not been shown. Carprofen has also been shown to inhibit the release of several prostaglandins in two inflammatory cell systems: rat polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and human rheumatoid synovial cells, indicating inhibition of acute (PMN system) and chronic (synovial cell system) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammatory reactions</span>.<span class="Sup">1</span></p>
<p>Several studies have demonstrated that carprofen has modulatory effects on both humoral and cellular immune responses.<span class="Sup">5â€“9</span> Data also indicate that carprofen inhibits the production of osteoclast-activating factor (OAF), PGE<span class="Sub">1</span>, and PGE<span class="Sub">2</span> by its inhibitory effect in prostaglandin biosynthesis.<span class="Sup">1</span></p>
<p>Based upon comparison with data obtained from intravenous administration, carprofen is rapidly and nearly completely absorbed (more than 90% bioavailable) when administered orally.<span class="Sup">10</span> Peak blood plasma concentrations are achieved in 1â€“3 hours after oral administration of 1, 5, and 25 mg/kg to dogs. The mean terminal half-life of carprofen is approximately 8 hours (range 4.5â€“9.8 hours) after single oral doses varying from 1â€“35 mg/kg of body weight. After a 100 mg single intravenous bolus dose, the mean elimination half-life was approximately 11.7 hours in the dog. Rovera is more than 99% bound to plasma protein and exhibits a very small volume of distribution.</p>
<p>Carprofen is eliminated in the dog primarily by biotransformation in the liver followed by rapid excretion of the resulting metabolites (the ester glucuronide of carprofen and the ether glucuronides of 2 phenolic metabolites, 7-hydroxy carprofen and 8-hydroxy carprofen) in the feces (70â€“80%) and urine (10â€“20%). Some enterohepatic circulation of the drug is observed.</p>

<p>All dogs should undergo a thorough history and physical examination before initiation of NSAID therapy. Appropriate laboratory tests to establish hematological and serum biochemical baseline data prior to, and periodically during, administration of any NSAID should be considered. <span class="Bold">Owners should be advised to observe for signs of potential <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">drug toxicity</span> (see <a href="#IFDO">Information for Dog Owners</a>, <a href="#AR">Adverse Reactions</a>, <a href="#AS">Animal Safety</a> and <a href="#PAE">Post-Approval Experience</a>).</span></p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS: </span> As a class, cyclooxygenase inhibitory NSAIDs may be associated with gastrointestinal, renal and hepatic toxicity. Effects may result from decreased prostaglandin production and inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase which is responsible for the formation of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid.<span class="Sup">11â€“14</span> When NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandins that cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> they may also inhibit those prostaglandins which maintain normal homeostatic function. These anti-prostaglandin effects may result in clinically significant disease in patients with underlying or pre-existing disease more often than in healthy patients.<span class="Sup">12,14</span> NSAID therapy could unmask occult disease which has previously been undiagnosed due to the absence of apparent clinical signs. Patients with underlying <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span> for example, may experience exacerbation or decompensation of their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span> while on NSAID therapy.<span class="Sup">11â€“14</span> The use of parenteral fluids during surgery should be considered to reduce the potential risk of renal complications when using NSAIDs perioperatively.</p>
<p>Carprofen is an NSAID, and as with others in that class, adverse reactions may occur with its use. The most frequently reported effects have been gastrointestinal signs. Events involving suspected renal, hematologic, neurologic, dermatologic, and hepatic effects have also been reported. Patients at greatest risk for renal toxicity are those that are dehydrated, on concomitant diuretic therapy, or those with renal, cardiovascular, and/or hepatic dysfunction. Concurrent administration of potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be approached cautiously, with appropriate monitoring. Concomitant use of Rovera with other anti-inflammatory drugs, such as other NSAIDs or corticosteroids, should be avoided because of the potential increase of adverse reactions, including gastrointestinal ulcerations and/or perforations. Sensitivity to drug-associated adverse reactions varies with the individual patient. Dogs that have experienced adverse reactions from one NSAID may experience adverse reactions from another NSAID. Rovera treatment was not associated with renal toxicity or gastrointestinal ulceration in well-controlled safety studies of up to ten times the dose in healthy dogs.</p>
<p>Rovera is not recommended for use in dogs with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> disorders (e.g., Von Willebrand's disease), as safety has not been established in dogs with these disorders. The safe use of Rovera in animals less than 6 weeks of age, pregnant dogs, dogs used for breeding purposes, or in lactating bitches has not been established. Studies to determine the activity of Rovera when administered concomitantly with other protein-bound or similarly metabolized drugs have not been conducted. Drug compatibility should be monitored closely in patients requiring additional therapy. Such drugs commonly used include cardiac, anticonvulsant and behavioral medications. It has been suggested that treatment with carprofen may reduce the level of inhalant anesthetics needed.<span class="Sup">15</span></p>
<p>If additional <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> medication is warranted after administration of the total daily dose of Rovera, alternative <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> should be considered. The use of another NSAID is not recommended. Consider appropriate washout times when switching from one NSAID to another or when switching from corticosteroids use to NSAID use.</p>
<p>Due to the palatable nature of Rovera chewable tablets, store out of reach of dogs in a secured location. Severe adverse reactions may occur if large quantities of tablets are ingested. If you suspect your dog has consumed Rovera chewable tablets above the labeled dose, please call your veterinarian for immediate assistance and call 1-800-916-8305.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Animal Safety: </span> Laboratory studies in unanesthetized dogs and clinical field studies have demonstrated that Rovera is well tolerated in dogs after oral administration.</p>
<p>In target animal safety studies, Rovera was administered orally to healthy Beagle dogs at 1, 3, and 5 mg/lb twice daily (1, 3 and 5 times the recommended total daily dose) for 42 consecutive days with no significant adverse reactions. Serum albumin for a single female dog receiving 5 mg/lb twice daily decreased to 2.1 g/dL after 2 weeks of treatment, returned to the pre-treatment value (2.6 g/dL) after 4 weeks of treatment, and was 2.3 g/dL at the final 6-week evaluation. Over the 6-week treatment period, black or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443530" conceptname="Hematochezia">bloody stools</span> were observed in 1 dog (1 incident) treated with 1 mg/lb twice daily and in 1 dog (2 incidents) treated with 3 mg/lb twice daily. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">Redness</span> of the colonic mucosa was observed in 1 male that received 3 mg/lb twice daily.</p>
<p>Two of 8 dogs receiving 10 mg/lb orally twice daily (10 times the recommended total daily dose) for 14 days exhibited <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4001047" conceptname="Hypoalbuminemia">hypoalbuminemia</span>. The mean albumin level in the dogs receiving this dose was lower (2.38 g/dL) than each of 2 placebo control groups (2.88 and 2.93 g/dL, respectively). Three incidents of black or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443530" conceptname="Hematochezia">bloody stool</span> were observed in 1 dog. Five of 8 dogs exhibited reddened areas of duodenal mucosa on gross pathologic examination. Histologic exam of these areas revealed no evidence of ulceration, but did show minimal congestion of the lamina propria in 2 of the 5 dogs.</p>
<p>In separate safety studies lasting 13 and 52 weeks, respectively, dogs were administered orally up to 11.4 mg/lb/day (5.7 times the recommended total daily dose of 2 mg/lb) of carprofen. In both studies, the drug was well tolerated clinically by all of the animals. No gross or histologic changes were seen in any of the treated animals. In both studies, dogs receiving the highest doses had average increases in serum L-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4211515" conceptname="Alanine aminotransferase">alanine aminotransferase</span> (ALT) of approximately 20 IU.</p>
<p>In the 52-week study, minor dermatologic changes occurred in dogs in each of the treatment groups but not in the control dogs. The changes were described as slight <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">redness</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> and were diagnosed as non-specific <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133835" conceptname="Eczema">dermatitis</span>. The possibility exists that these mild lesions were treatment related, but no dose relationship was observed.</p>
<p>Clinical field studies were conducted with 549 dogs of different breeds at the recommended oral doses for 14 days (297 dogs were included in a study evaluating 1 mg/lb twice daily and 252 dogs were included in a separate study evaluating 2 mg/lb once daily). In both studies the drug was clinically well tolerated and the incidence of clinical adverse reactions for Rovera-treated animals was no higher than placebo-treated animals (placebo contained inactive ingredients found in Rovera). For animals receiving 1 mg/lb twice daily, the mean post-treatment serum ALT values were 11 IU greater and 9 IU less than pre-treatment values for dogs receiving Rovera and placebo, respectively. Differences were not statistically significant. For animals receiving 2 mg/lb once daily, the mean post-treatment serum ALT values were 4.5 IU greater and 0.9 IU less than pre-treatment values for dogs receiving Rovera and placebo, respectively. In the latter study, 3 Rovera-treated dogs developed a 3-fold or greater increase in (ALT) and/or (AST) during the course of therapy. One placebo-treated dog had a greater than 2-fold increase in ALT. None of these animals showed clinical signs associated with laboratory value changes. Changes in the clinical laboratory values (hematology and clinical chemistry) were not considered clinically significant. The 1 mg/lb twice daily course of therapy was repeated as needed at 2-week intervals in 244 dogs, some for as long as 5 years.</p>
<p>Clinical field studies were conducted in 297 dogs of different breeds undergoing orthopedic or soft tissue surgery. Dogs were administered 2 mg/lb of Rovera two hours prior to surgery then once daily, as needed for 2 days (soft tissue surgery) or 3 days (orthopedic surgery). Rovera was well tolerated when used in conjunction with a variety of anesthetic-related drugs. The type and severity of abnormal health observation in Rovera- and placebo-treated animals were approximately equal and few in number (see <a href="#AR">Adverse Reactions</a>). The most frequent abnormal health observation was <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> and was observed at approximately the same frequency in Rovera- and placebo-treated animals. Changes in clinicopathologic indices of hematopoietic, renal, hepatic, and clotting function were not clinically significant. The mean post-treatment serum ALT values were 7.3 IU and 2.5 IU less than pre-treatment values for dogs receiving Rovera and placebo, respectively. The mean post-treatment AST values were 3.1 IU less for dogs receiving Rovera and 0.2 IU greater for dogs receiving placebo.</p>

<p class="First">This summary contains important information about Rovera. You should read this information before you start giving your dog Rovera and review it each time the prescription is refilled. This sheet is provided only as a summary and does not take the place of instructions from your veterinarian. Talk to your veterinarian if you do not understand any of this information or if you want to know more about Rovera.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What is Rovera?</span></p>
<p>Rovera is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used to reduce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> (soreness) due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80180" conceptname="Osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> following surgery in dogs. Rovera is a prescription drug for dogs. It is available as a chewable tablet and is given to dogs by mouth.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80180" conceptname="Osteoarthritis">Osteoarthritis</span> (OA) is a painful condition caused by "wear and tear" of cartilage and other parts of the joints that may result in the following changes or signs in your dog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limping or lameness</li>
<li><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4139968" conceptname="Underactive">Decreased activity</span> or exercise (reluctance to stand, climb stairs, jump or run, or difficulty in performing these activities)</li>
<li><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4060220" conceptname="Stiff neck">Stiffness</span> or decreased movement of joints</li>
</ul>
<p>To control surgical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> (e.g. for surgeries such as spays, ear procedures or orthopedic repairs) your veterinarian may administer Rovera before the procedure and recommend that your dog be treated for several days after going home.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What kind of results can I expect when my dog is on Rovera?</span></p>
<p>While Rovera is not a cure for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80180" conceptname="Osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</span>, it can relieve the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> of OA and improve your dog's mobility.</p>
<ul>
<li>Response varies from dog to dog but can be quite dramatic.</li>
<li>In most dogs, improvement can be seen in a matter of days.</li>
<li>If Rovera is discontinued or not given as directed, your dog's <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> may come back.</li>

</ul>
<p>Tell your veterinarian if your dog is:</p>
<ul><li>Pregnant, nursing or if you plan to breed your dog.</li></ul>
<p><span class="Bold">What are the possible side effects that may occur in my dog during Rovera therapy?</span></p>
<p>Rovera, like other drugs, may cause some side effects. Serious but rare side effects have been reported in dogs taking NSAIDs, including Rovera. Serious side effects can occur with or without warning and in rare situations result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.</p>
<p>The most common NSAID-related side effects generally involve the stomach (such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcers</span>), and liver or kidney problems. Look for the following side effects that can indicate your dog may be having a problem with Rovera or may have another medical problem:</p>
