<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Preclinical Toxicology: </span>CHEMET has low acute oral toxicity, with oral median lethal doses in rodents in excess of 3.6 g/kg. In a 28-day toxicity study, dogs receiving 30 and 100 mg/kg/day had lower urinary specific gravity and an increase in renal tubular regenerative <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4296894" conceptname="Hyperplasia">hyperplasia</span>. No renal toxicity was noted in dogs given 50 mg/kg/day orally for 14 consecutive days. In a chronic 6-month oral toxicity study, one male dog died (out of 7) at a dose of 200 mg/kg/day attributed to associated renal toxicity. Treatment related renal tubule epithelial changes in this study were observed in dogs after chronic (6-month) exposure to 110 and 200 mg/kg/day for 17 days then to 80 and 140 mg/kg/day for the remainder of the study. These changes were dose-dependent and correlated with increased kidney weights in male and female dogs at the 10 mg/kg/day dose. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">Nephropathy</span> was not observed in dogs treated at 10 mg/kg/day. Reduced platelet counts were noted in 5 of 7 dogs receiving either 80 or 140 mg/kg/day for 3 or 6 months, although group means were not statistically different from concurrent controls. Platelets had not been quantified in earlier studies. Normal megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, plus the absence of fibrin degradation products or histologic evidence for DIC, suggested an autoimmune-mediated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span>, a finding common in dogs but not in other species. However, serum antibody tests were inconclusive. Rats dosed chronically to 500 mg/kg/day developed no evidence for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">nephropathy</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span>.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics: </span>In a study performed in healthy adult volunteers, after a single dose of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-succimer at 16, 32, or 48 mg/kg, absorption was rapid but variable with peak blood radioactivity levels between one and two hours. On average, 49% of the radiolabeled dose was excreted: 39% in the feces, 9% in the urine and 1% as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135927" conceptname="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</span> from the lungs. Since fecal excretion probably represented nonabsorbed drug, most of the absorbed drug was excreted by the kidneys. The apparent elimination half-life of the radiolabeled material in the blood was about two days.</p>
<p>In other studies of healthy adult volunteers receiving a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg, the chemical analysis of succimer and its metabolites in the urine showed that succimer was rapidly and extensively metabolized. Approximately 25% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine with the peak blood level and urinary excretion occurring between two and four hours. Of the total amount of drug eliminated in the urine, approximately 90% was eliminated in altered form as mixed succimer-cysteine disulfides; the remaining 10% was eliminated unchanged. The majority of mixed disulfides consisted of succimer in disulfide linkages with two molecules of L-cysteine, the remaining disulfides contained one L-cysteine per succimer molecule.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pharmacodynamics: </span>Dose ranging studies were performed in 18 men with blood lead levels of 44-96 mcg/dL. Three groups of 6 patients received either 10.0, 6.7 or 3.3 mg/kg succimer orally every 8 hours for 5 days. After five days the mean blood levels of the three groups decreased 72.5%, 58.3% and 35.5% respectively. The mean urinary lead excretions in the initial 24 hours were 28.6, 18.6 and 12.3 times the pretreatment 24 hour urinary lead excretion. As the chelatable pool was reduced during therapy, urinary lead output decreased. A mean of 19 mg of lead was excreted during a five-day course of 30 mg/kg/day succimer. Clinical symptoms, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">colic</span>, and biochemical indices of lead toxicity also improved. Decrease in urinary excretion of d-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and coproporphyrin paralleled the improvement in erythrocyte d-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALA-D). Three control patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436876" conceptname="Toxic effect of lead compound">lead poisoning</span> of similar severity received CaNa2EDTA intravenously at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day for five days. The mean blood lead level decreased 47.4% and the mean urinary lead excretion was 21 mg in the control patients.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effect on Essential Minerals: </span>In the above studies succimer had no significant effect on the urinary elimination of iron, calcium or magnesium. Zinc excretion doubled during treatment. The effect of succimer on the excretion of essential minerals was small compared to that of CaNa<span class="Sub">2</span>EDTA, which can induce more than a ten-fold increase in urinary excretion of zinc and doubling of copper and iron excretion.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Efficacy: </span>A dose ranging study was performed in 15 pediatric patients aged 2 to 7 years with blood lead levels of 30-49 mcg/dL and positive CaNa<span class="Sub">2</span>EDTA lead mobilization tests. Each group of five patients received 350, 233 or 116 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> succimer every 8 hours for 5 days. These doses corresponded to 10, 6.7 and 3.3 mg/kg. Six control patients received 1000 mg/m2/day CaNa<span class="Sub">2</span>EDTA intravenously for 5 days. Following therapy, the mean blood lead levels decreased 78, 63 and 42% respectively in the three groups treated with succimer. The response of the 350 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> every 8 hours (10 mg/kg every 8 hours) group was significantly better than that of the other succimer treated groups as well as that of the control group, whose mean blood lead level fell 48%. No adverse reactions or changes in essential mineral excretion were reported in the succimer treated groups. In the CaNa<span class="Sub">2</span>EDTA treated group, the cumulative amount of urinary lead excreted was slightly but significantly greater than in the succimer group. After CaNa<span class="Sub">2</span>EDTA, the urinary excretion of copper, zinc, iron and calcium were significantly increased.</p>
<p>As with other chelators, both adults and pediatric patients experienced a rebound in blood lead levels after discontinuation of CHEMET. In these studies, after treatment with a dose of 350 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (10 mg/kg) every 8 hours for five days, the mean lead level rebounded and plateaued at 60-85% of pretreatment levels two weeks after therapy. The rebound plateau was somewhat higher with lower doses of succimer and with intravenous CaNa<span class="Sub">2</span>EDTA.</p>
<p>In an attempt to control rebound of blood lead levels, 19 pediatric patients, ages 1-7 years, with blood lead levels of 42-67 mcg/dL, were treated with 350 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> succimer every 8 hours for five days and then divided into three groups. One group was followed for two weeks with no further therapy, the second group was treated for two weeks with 350 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> daily, and the third with 350 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> every 12 hours. After the initial 5 days of therapy, the mean blood lead level in all subjects declined 61%. While the untreated group and the group treated with 350 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> daily experienced rebound during the ensuing two weeks, the group who received the 350 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> every 12 hours experienced no such rebound during the treatment period and less rebound following cessation of therapy.</p>
<p>In another study, ten pediatric patients, ages 21 to 72 months, with blood lead levels of 30-57 mcg/dL were treated with succimer 350 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> every eight hours for five days followed by an additional 19-22 days of therapy at a dose of 350 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> every 12 hours. The mean blood lead levels decreased and remained stable at under 15 mcg/dL during the extended dosing period.</p>
<p>In addition to the controlled studies, approximately 250 patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436876" conceptname="Toxic effect of lead compound">lead poisoning</span> have been treated with succimer either orally or parenterally in open U.S. and foreign studies with similar results reported. Succimer has been used for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436876" conceptname="Toxic effect of lead compound">lead poisoning</span> in one patient with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="22281" conceptname="Hb SS disease">sickle cell anemia</span> and in five patients with glucose-6-phosphodehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency without adverse reactions.</p>

<h1>
WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First">Keep out of reach of pediatric patients. CHEMET is not a substitute for effective abatement of lead exposure.</p>
<p>Mild to moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span> has been observed in some patients receiving succimer. While a causal relationship to succimer has not been definitely established, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span> has been reported with other drugs in the same chemical class. A complete blood count with <span class="Underline">white blood cell differential</span> and <span class="Underline">direct platelet counts</span> should be obtained prior to and weekly during treatment with succimer. Therapy should either be withheld or discontinued if the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is below 1200/mcL and the patient followed closely to document recovery of the ANC to above 1500/mcL or to the patient’s baseline neutrophil count. There is limited experience with reexposure in patients who have developed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span>. Therefore, such patients should be rechallenged only if the benefit of succimer therapy clearly outweighs the potential risk of another episode of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span> and then only with careful patient monitoring.</p>
<p>Patients treated with succimer should be instructed to promptly report any signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> is suspected, the above laboratory tests should be conducted immediately.</p>

<h1>
PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">The extent of clinical experience with CHEMET is limited. Therefore, patients should be carefully observed during treatment.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34072-9">
<a name="ID_e84cd1d9-b060-7c25-4b0b-e83d25ebdcbe"></a><a name="section-6.1"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">General: </span>Elevated blood lead levels and associated symptoms may return rapidly after discontinuation of CHEMET because of redistribution of lead from bone stores to soft tissues and blood. After therapy, patients should be monitored for rebound of blood lead levels, by measuring blood lead levels at least once weekly until stable. However, the severity of lead <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> (as measured by the initial blood lead level and the rate and degree of rebound of blood lead) should be used as a guide for more frequent blood lead monitoring.</p>
<p>All patients undergoing treatment should be adequately hydrated. Caution should be exercised in using CHEMET therapy in patients with compromised renal function. Limited data suggests that CHEMET is dialyzable, but that the lead chelates are not.</p>
<p>Transient mild elevations of serum transaminases have been observed in 6-10% of patients during the course of succimer therapy. Serum transaminases should be monitored before the start of therapy and at least weekly during therapy. Patients with a history of liver disease should be monitored closely. No data are available regarding the metabolism of succimer in patients with liver disease.</p>
<p>Clinical experience with repeated courses is limited. The safety of uninterrupted dosing longer than three weeks has not been established and it is not recommended.</p>
<p>The possibility of allergic or other mucocutaneous reactions to the drug must be borne in mind on readministration (as well as during initial courses). Patients requiring repeated courses of CHEMET should be monitored during each treatment course. One patient experienced recurrent mucocutaneous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196499" conceptname="Vesicular eruption">vesicular eruptions</span> of increasing severity affecting the oral mucosa, the external urethral meatus and the perianal area on the third, fourth and fifth courses of the drug.

ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Clinical experience with CHEMET has been limited. Consequently, the full spectrum and incidence of adverse reactions including the possibility of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> or idiosyncratic reactions have not been determined. The most common events attributable to succimer, i.e., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302537" conceptname="Digestive system finding">gastrointestinal symptoms</span> or increases in serum transaminases, have been observed in about 10% of patients (see <a href="#ID_2e026922-f321-4133-4c3c-1413951e3dbe">PRECAUTIONS</a>). <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">Rashes</span>, some necessitating discontinuation of therapy, have been reported in about 4% of patients.

<p>In young pediatric patients who cannot swallow capsules, CHEMET can be administered by separating the capsule and sprinkling the medicated beads on a small amount of soft food or putting them in a spoon and following with fruit drink.</p>
<p>Identification of the source of lead in the pediatric patient’s environment and its abatement are critical to a successful therapy outcome. Chelation therapy is not a substitute for preventing further exposure to lead and should not be used to permit continued exposure to lead.</p>
<p>Patients who have received CaNa<span class="Sub">2</span>EDTA with or without BAL may use CHEMET for subsequent treatment after an interval of four weeks. Data on the concomitant use of CHEMET with CaNa<span class="Sub">2</span>EDTA with or without BAL are not available, and such use is not recommended.</p>
