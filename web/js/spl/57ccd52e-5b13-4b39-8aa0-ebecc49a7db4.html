<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Visicol<span class="Sup">Â®</span>Â (sodium phosphate monobasic
                            monohydrate, USP, and sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous, USP) is a
                            purgative used to clean the colon prior to colonoscopy. Visicol Tablets
                            are white to off-white compressed tablets, with a monogram "I" on each
                            side of the upper surface and a plain lower surface. Each tablet
                            contains 1.102 grams of sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate, USP and
                            0.398 grams of sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous, USP for a total of
                            1.5 grams of sodium phosphate per tablet. Inert ingredients include

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Visicol Tablets, taken in two doses of 30 grams (the complete
                            regimen contains a total of 60 grams of sodium phosphate) approximately
                            twelve hours apart, induces <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, which effectively cleanses the
                            entire colon. Each administration has a purgative effect for
                            approximately 1 to 3 hours. The primary mode of action is thought to be
                            through osmotic action of sodium, causing large amounts of water to be
                            drawn into the colon, promoting colon evacuation.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First"> An open-label pharmacokinetic study of Visicol in
                                    healthy volunteers was performed to determine the
                                    concentration-time profile of serum inorganic phosphorus levels
                                    after Visicol administration. All subjects received a total of
                                    60 grams of sodium phosphate with a total liquid volume of 3.6
                                    quarts. Subjects received a 30 gram dose (20 tablets given as 3
                                    tablets every 15 minutes with 8 ounces of clear liquids)
                                    beginning at 6 PM and then received a second 30 gram dose (20
                                    tablets given as 3 tablets every 15 minutes with 8 ounces of
                                    clear liquids) the following morning beginning at 6 AM. </p>
<p>Twenty-three healthy subjects (mean age 57 years old;
                                    57% male and 43% female; and 65%
                                    Hispanic, 30% Caucasian, and 4%
                                    African-American) participated in this pharmacokinetic study.
                                    The serum phosphorus level rose from a mean (Â± standard
                                    deviation) baseline of 4.0 (Â± 0.7) mg/dL to 7.7
                                    (Â± 1.6 mg/dL), at a median of 3 hours after the
                                    administration of the first 30 gram dose of Visicol Tablets (see
                                    Figure 1). </p>

<p>The serum phosphorus level rose to a mean of 8.4
                                    (Â± 1.9) mg/dL, at a median of 4 hours after the
                                    administration of the second 30 gram dose of Visicol Tablets.
                                    The serum phosphorus level remained above baseline for a median
                                    of 24 hours after the administration of the initial dose of
                                    Visicol Tablets (range 16 to 48 hours).</p>

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First">A total of 957 adult patients were enrolled and treated in the
                            controlled clinical trials of Visicol Tablets. Males and females were
                            about equally represented. Approximately 87% of the study
                            population was Caucasian. Visicol Tablets were found to be comparable in
                            cleansing efficacy to the comparison drug, a commercially available
                            polyethylene glycol-salt (PEG-salt solution) solution (Cherry Flavor
                                NuLYTELY<span class="Sup">Â®</span>). Two identical, single (investigator)
                            blind, randomized, multicenter trials were conducted comparing the
                            efficacy and safety of Visicol Tablets and the PEG-salt solution
                            comparator as a colon cleansing agent in patients undergoing routine
                            diagnostic colonoscopy. In each study, over 200 patients were randomized
                            to self-administer the Visicol Tablets and over 200 were randomized to
                            self-administer the PEG-salt solution comparator. Colonoscopy was
                            generally performed within 5 hours of the second dose. Physicians used a
                            four-point, validated Physician Questionnaire to assess efficacy. The
                            distribution of â€œexcellentâ€?,
                            â€œgoodâ€?, â€œfairâ€? and
                            â€œinadequateâ€?, as evaluated by the physician
                            performing the colonoscopy, was comparable in both groups. Cleansing
                            efficacy observed in these studies is described in Table 1.</p>

<p>The efficacy of overall colonic cleansing with the Visicol
                            Tablets was comparable to the PEG-salt solution. In addition, the
                            incidence of â€œInadequateâ€? colon cleansing ratings
                            due to poor purgative preparation was similar between Visicol Tablets
                            and the PEG-salt solution comparator. Also, cleansing efficacy in the
                            ascending colon with Visicol Tablets was comparable to the PEG-salt

<p class="First">Patients should be instructed to drink 8 ounces of clear
                                    liquids with each 3-tablet (or each 2-tablet) dose of Visicol.
                                    Patients should take a total of 3.6 quarts of clear liquids with
                                    Visicol. Inadequate fluid intake, as with any effective
                                    purgative, may lead to excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435796" conceptname="Dehydration">fluid loss</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436375" conceptname="Hypovolemia">hypovolemia</span>.

                                    should not take additional laxatives or purgatives, particularly
                                    additional sodium phosphate-based products. </p>
<p> Prolongation of the QT interval has been observed in
                                    some patients who were dosed with Visicol Tablets. QT
                                    prolongation with Visicol Tablets has been associated with

                                    Visicol Tablets should be used with caution in patients who are
                                    taking medications known to prolong the QT interval, since
                                    serious complications may occur. Pre-dose and post-colonoscopy
                                    ECGs should be considered in patients with known prolonged QT.
                                    In these studies, prolongation of the QT interval was also
                                    observed in some patients treated with PEG-salt solution. </p>
<p>Patients with a history of swallowing difficulties or
                                    anatomic narrowing of the esophagus, such as a stricture, may
                                    have difficulty swallowing Visicol Tablets. Undigested or
                                    partially digested Visicol Tablets may be seen in the stool or
                                    during colonoscopy. In addition, undigested tablets from other
                                    medications may be seen in the stool or during colonoscopy. </p>
<p> Administration of Visicol Tablets may induce colonic
                                    mucosal aphthous ulcerations, since this endoscopic finding
                                    observed with other sodium phosphate cathartic preparations.
                                    This colonoscopic finding should be considered in patients with
                                    known or suspect <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4074815" conceptname="Inflammatory bowel disease">inflammatory bowel disease</span> (IBD).</p>
<p>Because published data suggest that sodium phosphate
                                    absorption may be enhanced in patients experiencing an acute
                                    exacerbation of IBD, Visicol Tablets should be used with caution
                                    in IBD patients.</p>
<p> Since Visicol Tablets were not studied in patients who
                                    recently had cardiac surgery (including coronary artery bypass
                                    graft surgery) Visicol should be used with caution in these

<h2>Pregnancy</h2>
<p class="First">Category C. Reproduction studies have not been conducted
                                    with Visicol. It is also not known whether Visicol can cause
                                    fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, or can affect
                                    reproduction capacity. Visicol Tablets should be given to a

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First"> Safety and efficacy of Visicol Tablets have not been

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Of the 980 subjects/patients in the Visicol studies, 284
                                    (29%) subjects/patients were 65 years of age or older.
                                    Of the 548 subjects/patients who received Visicol in these
                                    studies, 146 (27%) were 65 years of age or older and 42
                                    (8%) subjects/patients were 75 years of age or older. </p>
<p> In two phase 3 Visicol trials (Study A and Study B), no
                                    overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed
                                    between geriatric patients and younger patients. Greater
                                    sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out;
                                    therefore, Visicol Tablets should be used with caution in
                                    geriatric patients.</p>
<p>Sodium phosphate is known to be substantially excreted by
                                    the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions with sodium
                                    phosphate may be greater in patients with impaired renal
                                    function. Since geriatric patients are more likely to have

<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Serious kidney problems.</span></span> Rare, but
                                    serious kidney problems can happen in people who take medicines

                                    colon before a colonoscopy. These kidney problems can sometimes
                                    lead to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">kidney failure</span> or the need for dialysis for a long time.
                                    These problems often happen within a few days, but sometimes may
                                    happen several months after taking VISICOL.</p>
<p>Conditions that can make you more at risk for having
