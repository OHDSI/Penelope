<h1>INDICATIONS &amp; USAGE</h1>
<a href="http://"></a><p class="First"></p>
<p>NORVASC<span class="Sup">®</span> is indicated for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">strokes</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarctions</span>. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including NORVASC.</p>
<p>Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). </p>
<p>Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, but reductions in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. </p>
<p>Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> (for example, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432867" conceptname="Hyperlipidemia">hyperlipidemia</span>), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. </p>
<p>Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.</p>
<p>NORVASC may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<a href="http://"></a><p class="First"></p>
<p>The usual initial antihypertensive oral dose of NORVASC is 5 mg once daily, and the maximum dose is 10 mg once daily. </p>
<p>Small, fragile, or elderly patients, or patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic insufficiency</span> may be started on 2.5 mg once daily and this dose may be used when adding NORVASC to other antihypertensive therapy.</p>
<p>Adjust dosage according to blood pressure goals. In general, wait 7 to 14 days between titration steps. Titrate more rapidly, however, if clinically warranted, provided the patient is assessed frequently.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Angina</span>: The recommended dose for chronic stable or vasospastic angina is 5–10 mg, with the lower dose suggested in the elderly and in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic insufficiency</span>. Most patients will require 10 mg for adequate effect.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<a href="http://"></a><p class="First"></p>
<p>Symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> is possible, particularly in patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4189343" conceptname="Aortic valve stenosis">aortic stenosis</span>. Because of the gradual onset of action, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">acute hypotension</span> is unlikely. </p>
<p>
 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p></p>
<p>Worsening angina and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">acute myocardial infarction</span> can develop after starting or increasing the dose of NORVASC, particularly in patients with severe obstructive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317576" conceptname="Coronary arteriosclerosis">coronary artery disease</span>.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p></p>
<p>Because NORVASC is extensively metabolized by the liver and the plasma elimination half-life (t <span class="Sub">1/2</span>) is 56 hours in patients with impaired hepatic function, titrate slowly when administering NORVASC to patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<a href="http://"></a><p class="First"></p>
<p>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p>
<p>NORVASC has been evaluated for safety in more than 11,000 patients in U.S. and foreign clinical trials. In general, treatment with NORVASC was well-tolerated at doses up to 10 mg daily. Most adverse reactions reported during therapy with NORVASC were of mild or moderate severity. In controlled clinical trials directly comparing NORVASC (N=1730) at doses up to 10 mg to placebo (N=1250), discontinuation of NORVASC because of adverse reactions was required in only about 1.5% of patients and was not significantly different from placebo (about 1%). The most commonly reported side effects more frequent than placebo are reflected in the table below. The incidence (%) of side effects that occurred in a dose related manner are as follows:</p>

<p>Clinical studies of NORVASC did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Elderly patients have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase of AUC of approximately 40–60%, and a lower initial dose may be required <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#S2.1">Dosage and Administration (2.1)</a>]</span>.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<a href="http://"></a><p class="First"></p>
<p>Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow-channel blocker) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be detected <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine. Within the physiologic pH range, amlodipine is an ionized compound (pKa=8.6), and its kinetic interaction with the calcium channel receptor is characterized by a gradual rate of association and dissociation with the receptor binding site, resulting in a gradual onset of effect.</p>
<p>Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span> and reduction in blood pressure.</p>
<p>The precise mechanisms by which amlodipine relieves angina have not been fully delineated, but are thought to include the following:</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p></p>
<p>Exertional Angina: In patients with exertional angina, NORVASC reduces the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works and reduces the rate pressure product, and thus myocardial oxygen demand, at any given level of exercise.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p></p>
<p>Vasospastic Angina: NORVASC has been demonstrated to block constriction and restore blood flow in coronary arteries and arterioles in response to calcium, potassium epinephrine, serotonin, and thromboxane A2 analog in experimental animal models and in human coronary vessels <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>. This inhibition of coronary spasm is responsible for the effectiveness of NORVASC in vasospastic (Prinzmetal's or variant) angina.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p></p>
<p>Hemodynamics: Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, NORVASC produces vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing. Although the acute intravenous administration of amlodipine decreases arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in hemodynamic studies of patients with chronic stable angina, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical trials did not lead to clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressures in normotensive patients with angina.</p>
<p>With chronic once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with NORVASC is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation; thus, individuals with moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> (diastolic pressure 105–114 mmHg) had about a 50% greater response than patients with mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> (diastolic pressure 90–104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressures (+1/–2 mmHg).</p>
<p>In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of NORVASC resulted in a decrease in renal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span> and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow without change in filtration fraction or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75650" conceptname="Proteinuria">proteinuria</span>.</p>
<p>As with other calcium channel blockers, hemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with NORVASC have generally demonstrated a small increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208254" conceptname="Cardiac index">cardiac index</span> without significant influence on dP/dt or on left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In hemodynamic studies, NORVASC has not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and man, even when co-administered with beta-blockers to man. Similar findings, however, have been observed in normal or well-compensated patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> with agents possessing significant negative inotropic effects.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p></p>
<p>Electrophysiologic Effects: NORVASC does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals or man. In patients with chronic stable angina, intravenous administration of 10 mg did not significantly alter A-H and H-V conduction and sinus node recovery time after pacing. Similar results were obtained in patients receiving NORVASC and concomitant beta-blockers. In clinical studies in which NORVASC was administered in combination with beta-blockers to patients with either <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were observed. In clinical trials with angina patients alone, NORVASC therapy did not alter electrocardiographic intervals or produce higher degrees of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316135" conceptname="Atrioventricular block">AV blocks</span>.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p></p>
<p>After oral administration of therapeutic doses of NORVASC, absorption produces peak plasma concentrations between 6 and 12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated to be between 64 and 90%. The bioavailability of NORVASC is not altered by the presence of food.</p>
<p>Amlodipine is extensively (about 90%) converted to inactive metabolites via hepatic metabolism with 10% of the parent compound and 60% of the metabolites excreted in the urine. <span class="Italics">Ex vivo</span> studies have shown that approximately 93% of the circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients. Elimination from the plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination half-life of about 30–50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels of amlodipine are reached after 7 to 8 days of consecutive daily dosing.</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>. Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> may therefore receive the usual initial dose.</p>
<p>Elderly patients and patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic insufficiency</span> have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase in AUC of approximately 40–60%, and a lower initial dose may be required. A similar increase in AUC was observed in patients with moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p></p>
<p>Sixty-two hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years received doses of NORVASC between 1.25 mg and 20 mg. Weight-adjusted clearance and volume of distribution were similar to values in adults.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<a href="http://"></a><p class="First"></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Adult Patients</span></p>
<p>The antihypertensive efficacy of NORVASC has been demonstrated in a total of 15 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies involving 800 patients on NORVASC and 538 on placebo. Once daily administration produced statistically significant placebo-corrected reductions in supine and standing blood pressures at 24 hours postdose, averaging about 12/6 mmHg in the standing position and 13/7 mmHg in the supine position in patients with mild to moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>. Maintenance of the blood pressure effect over the 24-hour dosing interval was observed, with little difference in peak and trough effect. Tolerance was not demonstrated in patients studied for up to 1 year. The 3 parallel, fixed dose, dose response studies showed that the reduction in supine and standing blood pressures was dose-related within the recommended dosing range. Effects on diastolic pressure were similar in young and older patients. The effect on systolic pressure was greater in older patients, perhaps because of greater baseline systolic pressure. Effects were similar in black patients and in white patients.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients</span></p>
<p>Two hundred sixty-eight hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years were randomized first to NORVASC 2.5 or 5 mg once daily for 4 weeks and then randomized again to the same dose or to placebo for another 4 weeks. Patients receiving 2.5 mg or 5 mg at the end of 8 weeks had significantly lower systolic blood pressure than those secondarily randomized to placebo. The magnitude of the treatment effect is difficult to interpret, but it is probably less than 5 mmHg systolic on the 5 mg dose and 3.3 mmHg systolic on the 2.5 mg dose. Adverse events were similar to those seen in adults.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p></p>
<p>The effectiveness of 5–10 mg/day of NORVASC in exercise-induced angina has been evaluated in 8 placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of up to 6 weeks duration involving 1038 patients (684 NORVASC, 354 placebo) with chronic stable angina. In 5 of the 8 studies, significant increases in exercise time (bicycle or treadmill) were seen with the 10 mg dose. Increases in symptom-limited exercise time averaged 12.8% (63 sec) for NORVASC 10 mg, and averaged 7.9% (38 sec) for NORVASC 5 mg. NORVASC 10 mg also increased time to 1 mm ST segment deviation in several studies and decreased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321318" conceptname="Angina pectoris">angina attack</span> rate. The sustained efficacy of NORVASC in angina patients has been demonstrated over long-term dosing. In patients with angina, there were no clinically significant reductions in blood pressures (4/1 mmHg) or changes in heart rate (+0.3 bpm).</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p></p>
<p>In a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 4 weeks duration in 50 patients, NORVASC therapy decreased attacks by approximately 4/week compared with a placebo decrease of approximately 1/week (p&lt;0.01). Two of 23 NORVASC and 7 of 27 placebo patients discontinued from the study due to lack of clinical improvement.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p></p>
<p>In PREVENT, 825 patients with angiographically documented <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317576" conceptname="Coronary arteriosclerosis">coronary artery disease</span> were randomized to NORVASC (5–10 mg once daily) or placebo and followed for 3 years.  Although the study did not show significance on the primary objective of change in coronary luminal diameter as assessed by quantitative coronary angiography, the data suggested a favorable outcome with respect to fewer hospitalizations for angina and revascularization procedures in patients with CAD.  </p>
<p>CAMELOT enrolled 1318 patients with CAD recently documented by angiography, without left main <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317576" conceptname="Coronary arteriosclerosis">coronary disease</span> and without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> or an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4108582" conceptname="Left ventricular ejection fraction">ejection fraction</span> &lt;40%. Patients (76% males, 89% Caucasian, 93% enrolled at US sites, 89% with a history of angina, 52% without PCI, 4% with PCI and no stent, and 44% with a stent) were randomized to double-blind treatment with either NORVASC (5–10 mg once daily) or placebo in addition to standard care that included aspirin (89%), statins (83%), beta-blockers (74%), nitroglycerin (50%), anti-coagulants (40%), and diuretics (32%), but excluded other calcium channel blockers. The mean duration of follow-up was 19 months. The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of one of the following events: hospitalization for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321318" conceptname="Angina pectoris">angina pectoris</span>, coronary revascularization, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, cardiovascular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>, resuscitated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span>, hospitalization for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>/TIA, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321052" conceptname="Peripheral vascular disease">peripheral vascular disease</span>. A total of 110 (16.6%) and 151 (23.1%) first events occurred in the NORVASC and placebo groups, respectively, for a hazard ratio of 0.691 (95% CI: 0.540–0.884, p = 0.003). The primary endpoint is summarized in Figure 1 below. The outcome of this study was largely derived from the prevention of hospitalizations for angina and the prevention of revascularization procedures (see Table 1). Effects in various subgroups are shown in Figure 2.  </p>
<p>In an angiographic substudy (n=274) conducted within CAMELOT, there was no significant difference between amlodipine and placebo on the change of atheroma volume in the coronary artery as assessed by intravascular ultrasound.</p>

<p>NORVASC has been compared to placebo in four 8–12 week studies of patients with NYHA Class II/III <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, involving a total of 697 patients. In these studies, there was no evidence of worsened <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> based on measures of exercise tolerance, NYHA classification, symptoms, or left ventricular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4108582" conceptname="Left ventricular ejection fraction">ejection fraction</span>. In a long-term (follow-up at least 6 months, mean 13.8 months) placebo-controlled mortality/morbidity study of NORVASC 5–10 mg in 1153 patients with NYHA Classes III (n=931) or IV (n=222) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> on stable doses of diuretics, digoxin, and ACE inhibitors, NORVASC had no effect on the primary endpoint of the study which was the combined endpoint of all-cause mortality and cardiac morbidity (as defined by life-threatening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">acute myocardial infarction</span>, or hospitalization for worsened <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>), or on NYHA classification, or symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>. Total combined all-cause mortality and cardiac morbidity events were 222/571 (39%) for patients on NORVASC and 246/583 (42%) for patients on placebo; the cardiac morbid events represented about 25% of the endpoints in the study.</p>
<p>Another study (PRAISE-2) randomized patients with NYHA Class III (80%) or IV (20%) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> without clinical symptoms or objective evidence of underlying ischemic disease, on stable doses of ACE inhibitors (99%), digitalis (99%), and diuretics (99%), to placebo (n=827) or NORVASC (n=827) and followed them for a mean of 33 months. There was no statistically significant difference between NORVASC and placebo in the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality (95% confidence limits from 8% reduction to 29% increase on NORVASC). With NORVASC there were more reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4078925" conceptname="Pulmonary edema">pulmonary edema</span>.</p>

<p>Read this information carefully before you start taking <span class="Bold">NORVASC</span> (NORE-vask) and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. This information does not replace talking with your doctor.  If you have any questions about <span class="Bold">NORVASC</span>, ask your doctor.  Your doctor will know if <span class="Bold">NORVASC </span>is right for you.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What is NORVASC?</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">NORVASC </span>is a type of medicine known as a calcium channel blocker (CCB). It is used to treat high blood pressure (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>) and a type of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77670" conceptname="Chest pain">chest pain</span> called angina.

<p><span class="Bold">High Blood Pressure (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>)</span><br>High blood pressure comes from blood pushing too hard against your blood vessels. <span class="Bold">NORVASC </span>relaxes your blood vessels, which lets your blood flow more easily and helps lower your blood pressure. Drugs that lower blood pressure lower your risk of having a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</span>.</p>
