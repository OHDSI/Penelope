<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Flucytosine Capsules, USP are an antifungal agent available as 250 mg
and 500 mg capsules for oral administration. Each capsule also contains
corn starch, lactose monohydrate and talc. The 250 mg capsule shell
contains FD and C Yellow No.6, FD and C Green No. 3, D and C Yellow No.
10, titanium dioxide, sodium lauryl sulfate and gelatin. The 500 mg
capsule shell contains iron oxide yellow, iron oxide black, titanium
dioxide,Â carboxymethylcellulose, sodium lauryl sulfate andÂ  gelatin.
The imprinting ink for both the 250 mg and 500 mg capsules contain
black iron oxide. Chemically, flucytosine is 5-fluorocytosine, a
fluorinated pyrimidine which is related to fluorouracil and
floxuridine. It is a white to off-white crystalline powder with a
molecular weight of 129.09 and the following structural formula:</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Flucytosine is rapidly and virtually completely
absorbed following oral administration. Flucytosine Capsules are not
metabolized significantly when given orally to man. Bioavailability
estimated by comparing the area under the curve of serum concentrations
after oral and intravenous administration showed 78% to 89% absorption
of the oral dose. Peak serum concentrations of 30 to 40 Î¼g/mL were
reached within 2 hours of administration of a 2 g oral dose to normal
subjects. Other studies revealed mean serum concentrations of
approximately 70 to 80 Î¼g/mL 1 to 2 hours after a dose in patients with
normal renal function receiving a 6-week regimen of flucytosine (150
mg/kg/day given in divided doses every 6 hours) in combination with
amphotericin B. The half-life in the majority of healthy subjects
ranged between 2.4 and 4.8 hours. Flucytosine is excreted via the
kidneys by means of glomerular filtration without significant tubular
reabsorption. More than 90% of the total radioactivity after oral
administration was recovered in the urine as intact drug. Flucytosine
is deaminated (probably by gut bacteria) to 5-fluorouracil. The area
under the curve (AUC) ratio of 5-fluorouracil to flucytosine is 4%.
Approximately 1% of the dose is present in the urine as the Î±-fluoro-Î²-
ureido-propionic acid metabolite. A small portion of the dose is
excreted in the feces.<br></p>
<p>The half-life of flucytosine is
prolonged in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>; the average half-life
in nephrectomized or anuric patients was 85 hours (range: 29.9 to 250
hours). A linear correlation was found between the elimination rate
constant of flucytosine and creatinine clearance.<br><span class="Italics"></span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span>
studies have shown that 2.9% to 4% of flucytosine is protein-bound over
the range of therapeutic concentrations found in the blood. Flucytosine
readily penetrates the blood-brain barrier, achieving clinically
significant concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid.<br><br></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics in Pediatric Patients</span></p>Limited
data are available regarding the pharmacokinetics of Flucytosine
Capsules administered to neonatal patients being treated for systemic
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433968" conceptname="Candidiasis">candidiasis</span>. After five days of continuous therapy median peak levels
in infants were 19.6 Î¼g/mL, 27.7 Î¼g/mL, and 83.9 Î¼g/mL at doses of 25
mg/kg (N=3), 50 mg/kg (N=4), and 100 mg/kg (N=3), respectively. Mean
time to peak serum levels was of 2.5 Â± 1.3 hours, similar to that
observed in adult patients. A good deal of interindividual variability
was noted, which did not correlate with gestational age. Some patients
had serum levels &gt; 100 Î¼g/mL, suggesting a need for drug level
monitoring during therapy. In another study, serum concentrations were
determined during flucytosine therapy in two patients (total assays
performed =10). Median serum flucytosine concentrations at steady state
were calculated to be 57 Â± 10 Î¼g/mL (doses of 50 to 125 mg/kg/day,
normalized to 25 mg/kg per dose for comparison). In three infants
receiving flucytosine 25 mg/kg/day (four divided doses), a median
flucytosine half-life of 7.4 hours was observed, approximately double
that seen in adult patients. The concentration of flucytosine in the
cerebrospinal fluid of one infant was 43 Î¼g/mL 3 hours after a 25 mg
oral dose, and ranged from 20 to 67 mg/L in another neonate receiving
oral doses of 120 to 150 mg/kg/day.</div>

<h1>MICROBIOLOGY</h1>
<span class="Bold"></span><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span><p class="First">Flucytosine
is taken up by fungal organisms via the enzyme cytosine permease.
Inside the fungal cell, flucytosine is rapidly converted to
fluorouracil by the enzyme cytosine deaminase. Fluorouracil exerts its
antifungal activity through the subsequent conversion into several
active metabolites, which inhibit protein synthesis by being falsely
incorporated into fungal RNA or interfere with the biosynthesis of
fungal DNA through the inhibition of the enzyme thymidylate synthetase.<br></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Activity In Vitro</span></p>

report of â€œSusceptibleâ€? indicates that the pathogen is likely to be
inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the
concentration usually achievable. A report of "Intermediate" indicates
that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the
microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically
feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies
possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is
physiologically concentrated or in situations where a high dosage of
drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone which
prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major
discrepancies in interpretation. A report of "Resistant" indicates that
the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial
compound in the blood reaches the concentration usually achievable; other therapy should be selected. Because of other significant host factors, <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> susceptibility may not correlate with clinical outcomes.<br><br>Standardized
susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control
microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory
procedures. Standard flucytosine powder should provide the following

Patients may be more prone to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> of bone marrow
function if they: 1) have a hematologic disease, 2) are being treated
with radiation or drugs which depress bone marrow, or 3) have a history
of treatment with such drugs or radiation. Bone marrow toxicity can be
irreversible and may lead to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> in immunosuppressed patients.
Frequent monitoring of hepatic function and of the hematopoietic system
is indicated during therapy.</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">General</span><br></p>
<p>Before
therapy with Flucytosine Capsules is instituted, electrolytes (because
of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>) and the hematologic and renal status of the patient
should be determined (seeÂ  <a href="#warn">WARNINGS</a>). Close monitoring of the patient during therapy is essential.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Laboratory Tests</span><br></p>
<p>Since
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> can cause progressive accumulation of the drug, blood
concentrations and kidney function should be monitored during therapy.
Hematologic status (leucocyte and thrombocyte count) and liver function
(alkaline phosphatase, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4094657" conceptname="Aspartate aminotransferase">SGOT</span> and SGPT) should be determined at frequent
intervals during treatment as indicated.<br></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span><br></p>
<p>Cytosine
arabinoside, a cytostatic agent, has been reported to inactivate the
antifungal activity of Flucytosine Capsules by competitive inhibition.
Drugs which impair glomerular filtration may prolong the biological
half-life of flucytosine.<br></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions</span><br></p>
<p>Measurement
of serum creatinine levels should be determined by the JaffÃ© reaction,
since Flucytosine Capsules does not interfere with the determination of
creatinine values by this method. Most automated equipment for
measurement of creatinine makes use of the JaffÃ© reaction.<br></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</span><span class="Bold"><br></span></p>Flucytosine
has not undergone adequate animal testing to evaluate carcinogenic
potential. The mutagenic potential of flucytosine was evaluated in
Ames-type studies with five different mutants of <span class="Italics">S. typhimurium</span>
and no mutagenicity was detected in the presence or absence of
activating enzymes. Flucytosine was nonmutagenic in three different
repair assay systems (i.e., rec, uvr and pol). There have been no
adequate trials in animals on the effects of flucytosine on fertility
or reproductive performance. The fertility and reproductive performance

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">There is no experience with intentional overdosage. It
is reasonable to expect that overdosage may produce pronounced
manifestations of the known clinical adverse reactions. Prolonged serum
concentrations in excess of 100 Î¼g/mL may be associated with an
increased incidence of toxicity, especially gastrointestinal (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>,
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>), hematologic (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435224" conceptname="Leukopenia">leukopenia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span>) and
hepatic (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span>).<br></p>
<p>In the management of overdosage, prompt
gastric lavage or the use of an emetic is recommended. Adequate fluid
intake should be maintained, by the intravenous route if necessary,
since Flucytosine Capsules is excreted unchanged via the renal tract.
The hematologic parameters should be monitored frequently; liver and
kidney function should be carefully monitored. Should any abnormalities
appear in any of these parameters, appropriate therapeutic measures
should be instituted.<br></p>Since hemodialysis has been shown to
rapidly reduce serum concentrations in anuric patients, this method may
be considered in the management of overdosage.</div>

<h1>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">The usual dosage of Flucytosine Capsules is 50 to 150

<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> may be reduced or avoided if the capsules are given a few at a

elevated, or if there are other signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, the initial
dose should be at the lower level (seeÂ Â Â  <a href="#section-8"> WARNINGS</a>).</p>Flucytosine
