<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>A syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs.Â  Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome.Â  Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> is unknown.</p>
<p>Both the risk of developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase.Â  However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.</p>
<p>There is no known treatment for established cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn.Â  Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.</p>
<p>Given these considerations, antipsychotic drugs should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>.Â  Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that, 1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">not </span></span>available or appropriate.Â  In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought.Â  The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.</p>
<p>If signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> appear in a patient on antipsychotics, drug discontinuation should be considered.Â  However, some patients may require treatment despite the presence of the syndrome.Â  </p>

<p>A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="379802" conceptname="Neuroleptic malignant syndrome">Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome</span> (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs.Â  Clinical manifestations of NMS are <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260205" conceptname="Hyperpyrexia">hyperpyrexia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4050941" conceptname="Muscle rigidity">muscle rigidity</span>, altered mental status (including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4085823" conceptname="Catatonia">catatonic</span> signs) and evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434633" conceptname="Disorder of autonomic nervous system">autonomic instability</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4088122" conceptname="Heart irregular">irregular pulse</span> or blood pressure, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">diaphoresis</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac dysrhythmias</span>).Â  Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439142" conceptname="Myoglobinuria">myoglobinuria</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4230337" conceptname="Rhabdomyolysis">rhabdomyolysis</span>) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span>.</p>
<p>The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated.Â  In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255848" conceptname="Pneumonia">pneumonia</span>, systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS).Â  Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4181404" conceptname="Heat stroke">heat stroke</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">drug fever</span> and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.</p>
<p>The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available.Â  There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.</p>
<p>If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered.Â  The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260205" conceptname="Hyperpyrexia">Hyperpyrexia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4181404" conceptname="Heat stroke">heat stroke</span>, not associated with the above symptom complex, have also been reported with haloperidol.</p>

<p>Rodents given 2 to 20 times the usual maximum human dose of haloperidol by oral or parenteral routes showed an increase in incidence of resorption, reduced fertility, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441361" conceptname="Delayed delivery after artificial rupture of membranes">delayed delivery</span> and pup mortality.Â  No teratogenic effect has been reported in rats, rabbits or dogs at dosages within this range, but <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135923" conceptname="Cleft palate">cleft palate</span> has been observed in mice given 15 times the usual maximum human dose.Â  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135923" conceptname="Cleft palate">Cleft palate</span> in mice appears to be a nonspecific response to stress or nutritional imbalance as well as to a variety of drugs, and there is no evidence to relate this phenomenon to predictable human risk for most of these agents.</p>
<p>There are no well controlled studies with haloperidol in pregnant women.Â  There are reports, however, of cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134741" conceptname="Congenital anomaly of limb">limb malformations</span> observed following maternal use of haloperidol along with other drugs which have suspected teratogenic potential during the first trimester of pregnancy.Â  Causal relationships were not established in these cases.Â  Since such experience does not exclude the possibility of fetal damage due to haloperidol, this drug should be used during pregnancy or in women likely to become pregnant only if the benefit clearly justifies a potential risk to the fetus.Â  Infants should not be nursed during drug treatment.</p>

<p>Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, (including Haloperidol), during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery.Â  There have been reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208994" conceptname="Increased muscle tone">hypertonia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">hypotonia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4158346" conceptname="Respiratory distress">respiratory distress</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434750" conceptname="Feeding difficulties and mismanagement">feeding disorder</span> in these neonates.Â  These complications have varied in severity; while in some cases symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization.</p>

<p>Patients with clinically significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span> should be carefully monitored for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span> or other symptoms or signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur.Â  Patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span> (absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> should discontinue haloperidol and have their WBC followed until recovery.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Haloperidol should be administered cautiously to patients:</p>
<p>â€” with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134057" conceptname="Disorder of cardiovascular system">cardiovascular disorders</span>, because of the possibility of transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> and/or precipitation of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321318" conceptname="Angina pectoris">anginal pain</span>.Â  Should <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> occur and a vasopressor be required, epinephrine should not be used since haloperidol may block its vasopressor activity and paradoxical further lowering of the blood pressure may occur.Â  Instead, metaraminol, phenylephrine or norepinephrine should be used.</p>
<p>â€” receiving anticonvulsant medications, with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>, or with EEG abnormalities, because haloperidol may lower the convulsive threshold.Â  If indicated, adequate anticonvulsant therapy should be concomitantly maintained.</p>
<p>â€” with known allergies, or with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergic reactions</span> to drugs.</p>
<p>â€” receiving anticoagulants, since an isolated instance of interference occurred with the effects of one anticoagulant (phenindione).</p>
<p>If concomitant antiparkinson medication is required, it may have to be continued after haloperidol is discontinued because of the difference in excretion rates. If both areÂ  discontinued simultaneously, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373747" conceptname="Extrapyramidal disease">extrapyramidal symptoms</span> may occur.Â  The physician should keep in mind the possible increase in intraocular pressure when anticholinergic drugs, including antiparkinson agents, are administered concomitantly with haloperidol.</p>
<p>As with other antipsychotic agents, it should be noted that haloperidol may be capable of potentiating CNS depressants such as anesthetics, opiates, and alcohol.</p>
<p>In a study of 12 schizophrenic patients coadministered haloperidol and rifampin, plasma haloperidol levels were decreased by a mean of 70% and mean scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale were increased from baseline.Â  In 5 other schizophrenic patients treated with haloperidol and rifampin, discontinuation of rifampin produced a mean 3.3-fold increase in haloperidol concentrations.Â  Thus, careful monitoring of clinical status is warranted when rifampin is administered or discontinued in haloperidol-treated patients.</p>
<p>When haloperidol is used to control <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">mania</span> in cyclic disorders, there may be a rapid mood swing to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.</p>

<p>No mutagenic potential of haloperidol was found in the Ames <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span> microsomal activation assay.Â  Negative or inconsistent positive findings have been obtained in <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">in vitro </span></span>and <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">in vivo </span></span>studies of effects of haloperidol on chromosome structure and number.Â  The available cytogenetic evidence is considered too inconsistent to be conclusive at this time.</p>
<p>Carcinogenicity studies using oral haloperidol were conducted in Wistar rats (dosed at up to 5 mg/kg daily for 24 months) and in Albino Swiss mice (dosed at up to 5 mg/kg daily for 18 months).Â  In the rat study survival was less than optimal in all dose groups, reducing the number of rats at risk for developing tumors.Â  However, although a relatively greater number of rats survived to the end of the study in high-dose male and female groups, these animals did not have a greater incidence of tumors than control animals.Â  Therefore, although not optimal, this study does suggest the absence of a haloperidol-related increase in the incidence of neoplasia in rats at doses up to 20 times the usual daily human dose for chronic or resistant patients.</p>
<p>In female mice at 5 and 20 times the highest initial daily dose for chronic or resistant patients, there was a statistically significant increase in mammary gland neoplasia and total tumor incidence; at 20 times the same daily dose there was a statistically significant increase in pituitary gland neoplasia.Â  In male mice, no statistically significant differences in incidences of total tumors or specific tumor types were noted.</p>
<p>Antipsychotic drugs elevate prolactin levels; the elevation persists during chronic administration.Â  Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">in vitro, </span></span>a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with a previously detected breast cancer.Â  Although disturbances such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79884" conceptname="Galactorrhea not associated with childbirth">galactorrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443800" conceptname="Amenorrhea">amenorrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168447" conceptname="Gynecomastia">gynecomastia</span>, andÂ  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">impotence</span> have been reported, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients.Â  An increase in mammary neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of antipsychotic drugs.Â  Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date, however, have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis; the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time.</p>
<p>There are no well-controlled studies with haloperidol in pregnant women.Â  There are reports, however, of cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134741" conceptname="Congenital anomaly of limb">limb malformations</span> observed following maternal use of haloperidol along with other drugs which have suspected teratogenic potential during the first trimester of pregnancy.Â  Causal relationships were not established in these cases.Â  Since such experience does not exclude the possibility of fetal damage due to haloperidol, this drug should be used during pregnancy or in women likely to become pregnant only if the benefit clearly justifies a potential risk to the fetus.Â  Infants should not be nursed during drug treatment.</p>

<p>Clinical studies of haloperidol did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.Â  Other reported clinical experience has not consistently identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.Â  However, the prevalence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women (see <a href="#d710c8bd-6928-49e0-ba1e-f9154eeed167">WARNINGS</a>: <span><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#d710c8bd-6928-49e0-ba1e-f9154eeed167"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">Tardive Dyskinesia</span></a></span></span>).Â  Also, the pharmacokinetics of haloperidol in geriatric patients generally warrants the use of lower doses (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#aa34a18d-b3d7-489c-9c09-e8ccaca98cbd">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span></span>).</p>

<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Withdrawal Emergent Neurological Signs</span></span></p>
<p>Generally, patients receiving short-term therapy experience no problems with abrupt discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs.Â  However, some patients on maintenance treatment experience transient dyskinetic signs after abrupt withdrawal.Â  In certain of these cases the dyskinetic movements are indistinguishable from the syndrome described below under <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">â€œTardive Dyskinesiaâ€? </span></span>except for duration.Â  It is not known whether gradual withdrawal of antipsychotic drugs will reduce the rate of occurrence of withdrawal emergent neurological signs but until further evidence becomes available, it seems reasonable to gradually withdraw use of haloperidol.</p>

<p>As with all antipsychotic agents haloperidol has been associated with persistent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047115" conceptname="Oral dyskinesia">dyskinesias</span>.Â  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">Tardive dyskinesia</span>, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may appear in some patients on long-term therapy or may occur after drug therapy has been discontinued.Â  The risk appears to be greater in elderly patients on high-dose therapy, especially females.Â  The symptoms are persistent and in some patients appear irreversible.Â  The syndrome is characterized by rhythmical involuntary movements of tongue, face, mouth or jaw (e.g., protrusion of tongue, puffing of cheeks, puckering of mouth, chewing movements).Â  Sometimes these may be accompanied by involuntary movements of extremities and the trunk.</p>
<p>There is no known effective treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>; antiparkinson agents usually do not alleviate the symptoms of this syndrome.Â  It is suggested that all antipsychotic agents be discontinued if these symptoms appear.Â  Should it be necessary to reinstitute treatment, or increase the dosage of the agent, or switch to a different antipsychotic agent, this syndrome may be masked.</p>

<p>Since there is no specific antidote, treatment is primarily supportive.Â  A patent airway must be established by use of an oropharyngeal airway or endotracheal tube or, in prolonged cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>, by tracheostomy.Â  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">Respiratory depression</span> may be counteracted by artificial respiration and mechanical respirators.Â  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">circulatory collapse</span> may be counteracted by use of intravenous fluids, plasma, or concentrated albumin, and vasopressor agents such as metaraminol, phenylephrine and norepinephrine.Â  Epinephrine should not be used. In case of severe extrapyramidal reactions, antiparkinson medication should be administered.Â  ECG and vital signs should be monitored especially for signs of QT prolongation or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">dysrhythmias</span> and monitoring should continue until the ECG is normal.Â  Severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span> should be treated with appropriate antiarrhythmic measures.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>There is considerable variation from patient to patient in the amount of medication required for treatment.Â  As with all drugs used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span>, dosage should be individualized according to the needs and response of each patient.Â  Dosage adjustments, either upward or downward, should be carried out as rapidly as practicable to achieve optimum therapeutic control. </p>
<p>To determine the initial dosage, consideration should be given to the patientâ€™s age, severity of illness, previous response to other antipsychotic drugs, and any concomitant medication or disease state.Â  Debilitated or geriatric patients, as well as those with a history of adverse reactions to antipsychotic drugs, may require less Haloperidol Injection.Â  The optimal response in such patients is usually obtained with more gradual dosage adjustments and at lower dosage levels.</p>
<p>Parenteral medication, administered intramuscularly in doses of 2 to 5 mg, is utilized for prompt control of the acutely <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitated</span> schizophrenic patient with moderately severe to very severe symptoms.Â  Depending on the response of the patient, subsequent doses may be given, administered as often as every hour, although 4 to 8 hour intervals may be satisfactory.</p>
<p>Controlled trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of intramuscular administration in children have not been conducted.</p>
<p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>An oral form should supplant the injectable as soon as practicable.Â  In the absence of bioavailability studies establishing bioequivalence between these two dosage forms the following guidelines for dosage are suggested.Â  For an initial approximation of the total daily dose required, the parenteral dose administered in the preceding 24 hours may be used.Â  Since this dose is only an initial estimate, it is recommended that careful monitoring of clinical signs and symptoms, including clinical efficacy, sedation, and adverse effects, be carried out periodically for the first several days following the initiation of switchover.Â  In this way, dosage adjustments, either upward or downward, can be quickly accomplished.Â  Depending on the patientâ€™s clinical status, the first oral dose should be given within 12 to 24 hours following the last parenteral dose.</p>
