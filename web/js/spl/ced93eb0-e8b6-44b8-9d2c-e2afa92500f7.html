<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First"><a name="INV-6c7827ff-a2bb-4e31-886b-6d98c3b4f1ac"></a>Nortriptyline Hydrochloride, USP is 1-propanamine, 3-(10, 11-dihydro-5 <span class="Italics">H</span>-dibenzo <span class="Italics">[a,d]</span> cyclohepten-5-ylidene)-<span class="Italics">N</span>-methyl, hydrochloride. Its molecular weight is 299.8, and its molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">19</span>H<span class="Sub">21</span>Nâ€¢HCl.</p>
<p><a name="INV-e0467dfc-7fe2-4e02-894f-c9b38a3b20bf"></a>The oral solution contains nortriptyline hydrochloride equivalent to 10 mg/5 mL (38.0 Âµmol) of the base and 4% alcohol. It also contains benzoic acid, flavors, sorbitol, and water.</p>
<p><a name="INV-6c953a58-223b-430f-9547-fcdea91d45c8"></a>The structural formula is as follows:</p>

<h1>ACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"><a name="INV-8b33363d-7a37-4f2a-86f0-6f50abbc31be"></a>The mood elevating mechanism of tricyclic antidepressants is at present unknown. Nortriptyline hydrochloride is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. It inhibits the activity of such diverse agents as histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and acetylcholine. It increases the pressor effect of norepinephrine but blocks the pressor response of phenethylamine. Studies suggest that nortriptyline hydrochloride interferes with the transport, release, and storage of catecholamines. Operant conditioning techniques in rats and pigeons suggest that nortriptyline hydrochloride has a combination of stimulant and depressant properties.</p>

There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.</p>
<p><a name="INV-73b4bd72-4711-4d09-afc1-2cdb49e6a7ac"></a>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440374" conceptname="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">obsessive compulsive disorder</span> (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First"><a name="INV-6504907b-06b6-4964-b7f8-bd6f195732dd"></a>Steady-state serum concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants are reported to fluctuate significantly when cimetidine is either added or deleted from the drug regimen. Serious anticholinergic symptoms (severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226991" conceptname="Aptyalism">dry mouth</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192450" conceptname="Retention of urine">urinary retention</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079185" conceptname="Hazy vision">blurred vision</span>) have been associated with elevations in the serum levels of tricyclic antidepressants when cimetidine is added to the drug regimen. In addition, higher-than expected steady-state serum concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants have been observed when therapy is initiated in patients already taking cimetidine.</p>
<p><a name="INV-40eff78c-3b87-418d-9b99-4c32801b4932"></a>In well-controlled patients undergoing concurrent therapy with cimetidine, a decrease in the steady-state serum concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants may occur when cimetidine therapy is discontinued. The therapeutic efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants may be compromised in these patients when cimetidine is discontinued. Several of the tricyclic antidepressants have been cited in these reports.</p>
<p><a name="INV-cedf82c7-b159-493e-ad06-0a8c2e9d624e"></a>There have been greater than 2-fold increases in previously stable plasma levels of other antidepressants, including nortriptyline, when fluoxetine hydrochloride has been administered in combination with these agents. Fluoxetine and its active metabolite, norfluoxetine, have long half-lives (4 to 16 days for norfluoxetine), that may affect strategies during conversion from one drug to the other.</p>
<p><a name="INV-e01b7943-e72f-464b-8ffd-e277c4066b87"></a>Administration of reserpine during therapy with a tricyclic antidepressant has been shown to produce a â€œstimulatingâ€? effect in some depressed patients.</p>
<p><a name="INV-3576bebd-ce5e-4ff3-a9e3-04d69fc47be4"></a>Close supervision and careful adjustment of the dosage are required when nortriptyline hydrochloride is used with other anticholinergic drugs or sympathomimetic drugs.</p>
<p><a name="INV-04e081cf-b007-4864-afcb-989f737fbd37"></a>The patient should be informed that the response to alcohol may be exaggerated.</p>

<h2><span class="Underline">Drugs Metabolized by P450IID6</span></h2>
<p class="First"><a name="INV-e21e445b-aa9f-49ca-8df3-58780a95e8a7"></a>A subset (3% to 10%) of the population has reduced activity of certain drug metabolizing enzymes such as the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme P450IID6. Such individuals are referred to as â€œpoor metabolizersâ€? of drugs such as debrisoquin, dextromethorphan, and the tricyclic antidepressants. These individuals may have higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants when given usual doses. In addition, certain drugs that are metabolized by this isoenzyme, including many antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and others), may inhibit the activity of this isoenzyme, and thus may make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers with regard to concomitant therapy with other drugs metabolized by this enzyme system, leading to drug interactions.</p>
<p><a name="INV-da3ecadc-9f51-4bf5-8cb0-8a918e1674df"></a>Concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants with other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450IID6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the tricyclic antidepressant or the other drug. Therefore, co-administration of tricyclic antidepressants with other drugs that are metabolized by this isoenzyme, including other antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (eg, propafenone, flecainide, and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (eg, quinidine), should be approached with caution.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First"><a name="INV-6b191459-f4a7-4758-8b3a-81660bbed3ea"></a>Nortriptyline hydrochloride is not recommended for pediatric patients. Nortriptyline hydrochloride is administered orally in the form of an oral solution. Lower than usual dosages are recommended for elderly patients. The use of lower dosages for outpatients is more important than for hospitalized patients who will be treated under close supervision. The physician should initiate dosage at a low level and increase it gradually, checking the clinical response carefully and noting any evidence of intolerance. Following remission, maintenance medication may be required for a longer period of time at the lowest dose that will maintain remission.</p>
<p><a name="INV-ed06d06d-13ce-4299-a9a4-eca12bda5d7f"></a>If a patient develops minor side effects, the dosage should be reduced. The drug should be discontinued promptly if adverse effects of a serious nature or allergic manifestations occur.</p>

<p class="First"><a name="INV-0d0d12c1-b79b-4833-86da-0f8ad373d858"></a>25 mg 3 or 4 times daily; dosage should begin at a low level and be increased as required. As an alternate regimen, the total daily dose may be given once a day. When doses above 100 mg daily are administered, plasma levels of nortriptyline should be monitored and maintained in the optimum range of 50 to 150 ng/mL. Doses above 150 mg per day are not recommended.</p>

<p class="First"><a name="INV-7b5e6e38-2aea-4d32-8bd5-c0dfb1f9171e"></a>Optimal responses to nortriptyline have been associated with plasma concentrations of 50 to 150 ng/mL. Higher concentrations may be associated with more adverse experiences. Plasma concentrations are difficult to measure, and physicians should consult with the laboratory professional staff.</p>
<p><a name="INV-da202e29-fb2a-4308-a8f5-7649ccc26e52"></a>Larger plasma concentrations of the active nortriptyline metabolite 10-hydroxynortriptyline have been reported in older patients. In one case, such a condition was associated with apparent cardiotoxicity despite the fact that nortriptyline concentrations were within the â€œtherapeutic range.â€? Clinical findings should predominate over plasma concentrations as primary determinants of dosage changes.</p>
