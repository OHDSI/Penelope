<h1>DESCRIPTION:</h1>
<p class="First">Nitroglycerin is 1,2,3-propanetriol trinitrate, an organic nitrate whose structural formula is:</p>
<div class="Figure">
<img alt="Chemical Structure" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=04fa3e36-e782-4b33-bc1d-a3ca0990f490&amp;name=nitroglycerin-capsules-1.jpg"><p class="MultiMediaCaption"></p>
</div>
<p>The organic nitrates are vasodilators, active on both arteries and veins. Each Extended-Release Capsule, for oral administration contains 2.5 mg, 6.5 mg, or 9 mg of Nitroglycerin.</p>
<p>The inactive ingredients in each capsule are corn starch, ethylcellulose, gelatin, lactose monohydrate, pharmaceutical glaze, sugar, talc, and wax. Additionally the 2.5 mg capsule contains FD&amp;C Blue #1, D&amp;C Yellow #10, FD&amp;C Red #40, D&amp;C Red #28; the 6.5 mg capsule contains D&amp;C Yellow #10, FD&amp;C Yellow #6, FD&amp;C Blue #1, D&amp;C Red #33; the 9 mg capsule contains D&amp;C Yellow #10, FD&amp;C Yellow #6, FD&amp;C Green #3, and titanium dioxide.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter.  Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload).  Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span>, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload).  Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs.  The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction, and coronary dilatation remains undefined.  Dosing regimens for most chronically used drugs are designed to provide plasma concentrations that are continuously greater than a minimally effective concentration.  This strategy is inappropriate for organic nitrates.  Several well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the anti-anginal efficacy of continuously-delivered nitrates.  In the large majority of these trials, active agents were indistinguishable from placebo after 24 hours (or less) of continuous therapy.  Attempts to overcome nitrate tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in excess of those used acutely, have consistently failed.  Only after nitrates had been absent from the body for several hours was their anti-anginal efficacy restored.</p>

<h2></h2>
<p class="First">:  The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin is about 3 L/kg, and nitroglycerin is cleared from this volume at extremely rapid rates, with a resulting serum half-life of about 3 minutes.  The observed clearance rates (close to 1 L/kg/min) greatly exceed hepatic blood flow; known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls.
                                    <span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span></p>
<p>The first products in the metabolism of nitroglycerin are inorganic nitrate, and the 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerols.  The dinitrates are less effective vasodilators than nitroglycerin, but they are longer-lived in the serum, and their net contribution to the overall effect of chronic nitroglycerin regimens is not known.  The dinitrates are further metabolized to (non-vasoactive) mononitrates and, ultimately, to glycerol and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135927" conceptname="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</span>.</p>
<p>To avoid development of tolerance to nitroglycerin, drug-free intervals of 10-12 hours are known to be sufficient; shorter intervals have not been well studied.  In one well-controlled clinical trial, subjects receiving nitroglycerin appeared to exhibit a rebound or withdrawal effect, so that their exercise tolerance at the end of the daily drug-free interval was than that exhibited by the parallel group receiving placebo.
                                    <span class="Italics">less</span></p>
<p>Reliable assay techniques for plasma nitroglycerin levels have only recently become available, and studies using these techniques to define the pharmacokinetics of oral nitroglycerin preparations have not been reported.  Published studies using older techniques provide results that often differ, in similar experimental settings, by an order of magnitude.</p>

<h2></h2>
<p class="First">:  Controlled trials of single oral doses of nitroglycerin have demonstrated that nitroglycerin capsules can effectively reduce exercise-related angina for up to 5 hours.  Anti-anginal activity is present about 1 hour after ingestion of a capsule.
                                    <span class="Bold">Clinical Trials</span></p>
<p>Controlled trials of multiple-dose oral nitroglycerin have shown statistically significant anti-anginal efficacy 2½ and 4 hours after a dose when oral nitroglycerin had been administered four times a day for 2 weeks or three times a day for 1 week.  As noted above, careful studies with other formulations of nitroglycerin have shown that maintenance of continuous 24-hour plasma levels of nitroglycerin results in insurmountable tolerance.  Presumably, the studied 1-week and 2-week regimens of oral nitroglycerin therapy achieved adequate nitrate-free intervals by non-uniformity of dosing interval, with longer intervals overnight.  The investigators did not report how subjects interpreted their dosing instructions, and they similarly did not report which dose of the day was the one after which they obtained the end-of-trial exercise results.</p>
<p>Thus, these studies of oral nitroglycerin should be interpreted as demonstrations that these regimens provide round-the-clock anti-anginal protection.  From large, well-controlled studies of other nitroglycerin formulations, it is reasonable to believe that the maximal achievable daily duration of anti-anginal effect from Nitroglycerin Extended-Release Capsules is about 12 hours.
                                    <span class="Italics">not</span></p>
<p>In some controlled trials of other organic nitrate formulations, efficacy has declined with time.  Because the controlled, multiple-dose trials of oral nitroglycerin did not include exercise tests before the last day of treatment, it is not known how the efficacy of Nitroglycerin Extended-Release Capsules may vary during extended therapy.</p>

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.  In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

<p>The use of epinephrine or other arterial vasoconstrictors in this setting is likely to do more harm than good.</p>
<p>In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>, therapy resulting in central volume expansion is not without hazard.  Treatment of nitroglycerin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> in these patients may be subtle and difficult, and invasive monitoring may be required.</p>

<p class="First">: Nitrate ions liberated during metabolism of nitroglycerin can oxidize hemoglobin into methemoglobin.  Even in patients totally without cytochrome b reductase activity; however, and even assuming that the nitrate moieties of nitroglycerin are quantitatively applied to oxidation of hemoglobin, about 1 mg/kg of nitroglycerin should be required before any of these patients manifests clinically significant (≥10%) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">methemoglobinemia</span>.  In patients with normal reductase function, significant production of methemoglobin should require even larger doses of nitroglycerin.  In one study in which 36 patients received 2 to 4 weeks of continuous nitroglycerin therapy at 3.1 to 4.4 mg/hr, the average methemoglobin level measured 0.2%; this was comparable to that observed in parallel patients who received placebo.

<p>Notwithstanding these observations, there are case reports of significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">methemoglobinemia</span> in association with moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> of organic nitrates.  None of the affected patients had been thought to be unusually susceptible.  Methemoglobin levels are available from most clinical laboratories.  The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who exhibit signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span> and adequate arterial p0 .  Classically, methemoglobinemic blood is described as chocolate brown, without color change on exposure to air.

<p>When <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">methemoglobinemia</span> is diagnosed, the treatment of choice is methylene blue, 1 to 2 mg/kg intravenously.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</h1>
<p class="First">As noted above ( ) careful studies with other formulations of nitroglycerin have shown that maintenance of continuous 24-hour plasma levels of nitroglycerin results in tolerance (i.e., loss of clinical response).  Every dosing regimen for Nitroglycerin Extended-Release Capsules should provide a daily nitrate-free interval to avoid the development of this tolerance.  The minimum necessary length of such an interval has not been defined, but studies with other nitroglycerin formulations have shown that 10 to 12 hours is sufficient.  Large controlled studies with other formulations of nitroglycerin show that no dosing regimen with Nitroglycerin Extended-Release Capsules should be expected to provide more than about 12 hours of continuous anti-anginal efficacy per day.
                            <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_71941f8e-1ee1-411f-b459-86c56e28d6de">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of Nitroglycerin capsules, and the clinical effects of multiple-dose regimens, have not been well studied.  In clinical trials, the initial regimen of Nitroglycerin has been 2.5 to 6.5 mg three to four times a day, with subsequent upward dose adjustment guided by symptoms and side effects.  In one trial, 5 of the 18 subjects were titrated up to a dose of 26 mg four times a day.</p>
