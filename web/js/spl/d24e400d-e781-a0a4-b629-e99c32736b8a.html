<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Each rectal suppository contains 50 mg promethazine HCl with ascorbyl palmitate and polysorbate 80 in a specially blended base of saturated vegetable fatty acids. Phenergan (Promethazine HCl) Suppositories, USP are for rectal administration only. <br><br>Promethazine HCl is a racemic compound; the empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">17</span>H<span class="Sub">20</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>Sâ€¢HCl and its molecular weight is 320.88.<br><br> Promethazine HCl, a phenothiazine derivative, is designated chemically as 10<span class="Italics">H</span>-Phenothiazine, 10-ethanamine, <span class="Italics">N,N Î±</span>-trimethyl-, monohydrochloride, (Â±)- with the following structural formula:<br><img alt="structural formula" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=d24e400d-e781-a0a4-b629-e99c32736b8a&amp;name=structural%20formula.jpg"><br>Promethazine HCl occurs as a white to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">faint</span> yellow, practically odorless, crystalline powder, which slowly oxidizes and turns blue on prolonged exposure to air.

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Promethazine is a phenothiazine derivative, which differs structurally from the antipsychotic phenothiazines by the presence of a branched side chain and no ring substitution. It is thought that this configuration is responsible for its relative lack (1/10 that of chlorpromazine) of dopamine antagonist properties.<br><br>Promethazine is an H<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor blocking agent. In addition to its antihistaminic action, it provides clinically useful sedative and antiemetic effects. <br><br>Promethazine is metabolized by the liver to a variety of compounds; the sulfoxides of promethazine and N-demethylpromethazine are the predominant metabolites appearing in the urine.</p>

<h1>Labor and Delivery</h1>
<p class="First">Promethazine HCl may be used alone or as an adjunct to narcotic analgesics during labor and delivery. (See <span class="Bold">â€œDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATIONâ€?</span>). Limited data suggest that use of promethazine HCl during labor and delivery does not have an appreciable effect on the duration of labor or delivery and does not increase the risk of need for intervention in the newborn. The effect on later growth and development of the newborn is unknown. (See also <span class="Italics">Nonteratogenic Effects</span>.)</p>

<h1>Nursing Mothers</h1>
<p class="First">It is not known whether promethazine HCl is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Phenergan (Promethazine HCl) Suppositories, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<h1>Geriatric Use</h1>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of promethazine formulations did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. <br><br>Sedating drugs may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> and over-sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of Phenergan (Promethazine HCl) Suppositories and observed closely.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Signs and symptoms of overdosage with promethazine HCl range from mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system to profound <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372448" conceptname="Loss of consciousness">unconsciousness</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4132309" conceptname="Sudden death">sudden death</span>.

Only in cases of extreme overdosage or individual sensitivity do vital signs, including respiration, pulse, blood pressure, temperature, and EKG, need to be monitored. Activated charcoal orally or by lavage may be given, or sodium or magnesium sulfate orally as a cathartic. Attention should be given to the reestablishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Diazepam may be used to control <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">Acidosis</span> and electrolyte losses should be corrected. Note that any depressant effects of promethazine HCl are not reversed by naloxone. Avoid analeptics, which may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>. <br><br>The treatment of choice for resulting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> is administration of intravenous fluids, accompanied by repositioning if indicated. In the event that vasopressors are considered for the management of severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> that does not respond to intravenous fluids and repositioning, the administration of norepinephrine or phenylephrine should be considered. EPINEPHRINE SHOULD NOT BE USED, since its use in patients with partial adrenergic blockade may further lower the blood pressure. Extrapyramidal reactions may be treated with anticholinergic antiparkinsonian agents, diphenhydramine, or barbiturates. Oxygen may also be administered. <br><br>Limited experience with dialysis indicates that it is not helpful.</p>
