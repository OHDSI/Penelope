Analyses of seventeen placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> were varied, most of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4132309" conceptname="Sudden death">sudden death</span>) or infectious (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255848" conceptname="Pneumonia">pneumonia</span>) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. ZYPREXA (olanzapine) is not approved for the treatment of patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4182210" conceptname="Dementia">dementia</span>-related <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychosis</span>

<p><span class="Underline">Dose Selection</span> â€” Oral olanzapine should be administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals, generally beginning with 5 to 10Â mg initially, with a target dose of 10Â mg/day within several days. Further dosage adjustments, if indicated, should generally occur at intervals of not less than 1 week, since steady state for olanzapine would not be achieved for approximately 1 week in the typical patient. When dosage adjustments are necessary, dose increments/decrements of 5Â mgÂ QD are recommended.
</p>
<p>Efficacy in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> was demonstrated in a dose range of 10 to 15Â mg/day in clinical trials. However, doses above 10Â mg/day were not demonstrated to be more efficacious than the 10Â mg/day dose. An increase to a dose greater than the target dose of 10Â mg/day (i.e., to a dose of 15Â mg/day or greater) is recommended only after clinical assessment. Olanzapine is not indicated for use in doses above 20Â mg/day.

</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Dosing in Special Populations</span> â€” The recommended starting dose is 5Â mg in patients who are debilitated, who have a predisposition to hypotensive reactions, who otherwise exhibit a combination of factors that may result in slower metabolism of olanzapine (e.g., nonsmoking female patients â‰¥65 years of age), or who may be more pharmacodynamically sensitive to olanzapine <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<a href="#s63">5.14</a>), Drug Interactions (<a href="#s100">7</a>), and Clinical Pharmacology (<a href="#s143">12.3</a>)]</span>.

<p>A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="379802" conceptname="Neuroleptic malignant syndrome">Neuroleptic Malignant</span> SyndromeÂ (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including olanzapine. Clinical manifestations of NMS are <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260205" conceptname="Hyperpyrexia">hyperpyrexia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4050941" conceptname="Muscle rigidity">muscle rigidity</span>, altered mental status and evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434633" conceptname="Disorder of autonomic nervous system">autonomic instability</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4088122" conceptname="Heart irregular">irregular pulse</span> or blood pressure, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">diaphoresis</span> and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439142" conceptname="Myoglobinuria">myoglobinuria</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4230337" conceptname="Rhabdomyolysis">rhabdomyolysis</span>), and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span>.
</p>
<p>The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255848" conceptname="Pneumonia">pneumonia</span>, systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptomsÂ (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4181404" conceptname="Heat stroke">heat stroke</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">drug fever</span>, and primary central nervous system pathology.
</p>
<p>The management of NMS should include: 1)Â immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; 2)Â intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and 3)Â treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS.
</p>
<p>If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (<a href="#s178">17.3</a>)]</span>.

Physicians should consider the risks and benefits when prescribing olanzapine to patients with an established diagnosis of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus, or having borderline increased blood glucose level (fasting 100-126Â mg/dL, nonfasting 140-200Â mg/dL). Patients taking olanzapine should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients starting treatment with olanzapine should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span> including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432454" conceptname="Excessive thirst">polydipsia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">polyuria</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438872" conceptname="Excessive eating - polyphagia">polyphagia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">weakness</span>. Patients who develop symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span> during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span> has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (<a href="#s179">17.4</a>)]</span>.
</p>
<p>
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">Hyperglycemia</span>, in some cases extreme and associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4209145" conceptname="Ketoacidosis">ketoacidosis</span> or hyperosmolar <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including olanzapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> and the increasing incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus in the general population. Epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span>-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. While relative risk estimates are inconsistent, the association between atypical antipsychotics and increases in glucose levels appears to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> on a continuum and olanzapine appears to have a greater association than some other atypical antipsychotics.

<p>
Mean increases in blood glucose have been observed in patients treated (median exposure of 9.2 months) with olanzapine in phase 1 of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention EffectivenessÂ (CATIE). The mean increase of serum glucose (fasting and nonfasting samples) from baseline to the average of the 2 highest serum concentrations was 15.0Â mg/dL.
</p>
<p>
In a study of healthy volunteers, subjects who received olanzapine (N=22) for 3 weeks had a mean increase compared to baseline in fasting blood glucose of 2.3 mg/dL. Placebo-treated subjects (N=19) had a mean increase in fasting blood glucose compared to baseline of 0.34 mg/dL.

<p><span class="Underline">Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adults</span> â€” In an analysis of 5 placebo-controlled adult olanzapine monotherapy studies with a median treatment duration of approximately 3 weeks, olanzapine was associated with a greater mean change in fasting glucose levels compared to placebo (2.76Â mg/dL versus 0.17Â mg/dL). The difference in mean changes between olanzapine and placebo was greater in patients with evidence of glucose dysregulation at baseline (patients diagnosed with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus or related adverse reactions, patients treated with anti-diabetic agents, patients with a baseline random glucose level â‰¥200Â mg/dL, and/or a baseline fasting glucose level â‰¥126Â mg/dL). Olanzapine-treated patients had a greater mean HbA1c increase from baseline of 0.04% (median exposure 21 days), compared to a mean HbA1c decrease of 0.06% in placebo-treated subjects (median exposure 17 days).
</p>
<p>
In an analysis of 8 placebo-controlled studies (median treatment exposure 4-5 weeks), 6.1% of olanzapine-treated subjects (N=855) had treatment-emergent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434164" conceptname="Glycosuria">glycosuria</span> compared to 2.8% of placebo-treated subjects (N=599). <a href="#t2">Table 2</a> shows short-term and long-term changes in fasting glucose levels from adult olanzapine monotherapy studies.

<p>The risk of developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses or may even arise after discontinuation of treatment.
</p>
<p>There is no known treatment for established cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.
</p>
<p>Given these considerations, olanzapine should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients (1)Â who suffer from a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2)Â for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.
</p>
<p>If signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> appear in a patient on olanzapine, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with olanzapine despite the presence of the syndrome.

This database includes: (1)Â 2500 patients who participated in multiple-dose oral olanzapine premarketing trials in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> and Alzheimer's disease representing approximately 1122 patient-years of exposure as of FebruaryÂ 14, 1995; (2)Â 182 patients who participated in oral olanzapine premarketing bipolarÂ I disorder (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span> or mixed episodes) trials representing approximately 66 patient-years of exposure; (3)Â 191 patients who participated in an oral olanzapine trial of patients having various <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4294810" conceptname="Psychiatric symptom">psychiatric symptoms</span> in association with Alzheimer's disease representing approximately 29 patient-years of exposure; (4)Â 5788 patients from 88 additional oral olanzapine clinical trials as of DecemberÂ 31, 2001; and (5)Â 722 patients who participated in intramuscular olanzapine for injection premarketing trials in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitated</span> patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span>, bipolarÂ I disorder (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span> or mixed episodes), or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4182210" conceptname="Dementia">dementia</span>. In addition, information from the premarketing 6-week clinical study database for olanzapine in combination with lithium or valproate, consisting of 224 patients who participated in bipolarÂ I disorder (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span> or mixed episodes) trials with approximately 22 patient-years of exposure, is included below.
</p>
<p>The conditions and duration of treatment with olanzapine varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) open-label and double-blind phases of studies, inpatients and outpatients, fixed-dose and dose-titration studies, and short-term or longer-term exposure. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse reactions, results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analytes, ECGs, chest x-rays, and results of ophthalmologic examinations.
</p>
<p>Certain portions of the discussion below relating to objective or numeric safety parameters, namely, dose-dependent adverse reactions, vital sign changes, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span>, laboratory changes, and ECG changes are derived from studies in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> and have not been duplicated for bipolarÂ I disorder (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span> or mixed episodes) or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>. However, this information is also generally applicable to bipolarÂ I disorder (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span> or mixed episodes) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>.
</p>
<p>Adverse reactions during exposure were obtained by spontaneous report and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse reactions without first grouping similar types of reactions into a smaller number of standardized reaction categories. In the tables and tabulations that follow, MedDRA and COSTART Dictionary terminology has been used to classify reported adverse reactions.
</p>
<p>The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. The reported reactions do not include those reaction terms that were so general as to be uninformative. Reactions listed elsewhere in labeling may not be repeated below. It is important to emphasize that, although the reactions occurred during treatment with olanzapine, they were not necessarily caused by it. The entire label should be read to gain a complete understanding of the safety profile of olanzapine.
</p>
<p>The prescriber should be aware that the figures in the tables and tabulations cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse reactions incidence in the population studied.

<p>Following is a list of treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported by patients treated with oral olanzapine (at multiple doses â‰¥1Â mg/day) in clinical trials. This listing is not intended to include reactions (1)Â already listed in previous tables or elsewhere in labeling, (2)Â for which a drug cause was remote, (3)Â which were so general as to be uninformative, (4)Â which were not considered to have significant clinical implications, or (5)Â which occurred at a rate equal to or less than placebo. Reactions are classified by body system using the following definitions: frequent adverse reactions are those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare reactions are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.

<p><span class="Italics">Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adults:</span> An assessment of the premarketing experience for olanzapine revealed an association with asymptomatic increases in ALT, AST, and GGT. Within the original premarketing database of about 2400 adult patients with baseline ALT â‰¤90Â IU/L, the incidence of ALT elevations to &gt;200Â IU/L was 2% (50/2381). None of these patients experienced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span> or other symptoms attributable to liver impairment and most had transient changes that tended to normalize while olanzapine treatment was continued.
</p>
<p>
In placebo-controlled olanzapine monotherapy studies in adults, clinically significant ALT elevations (change from &lt;3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] at baseline to â‰¥3 times ULN) were observed in 5% (77/1426) of patients exposed to olanzapine compared to 1% (10/1187) of patients exposed to placebo. ALT elevations â‰¥5 times ULN were observed in 2% (29/1438) of olanzapine-treated patients, compared to 0.3% (4/1196) of placebo-treated patients. ALT values returned to normal, or were decreasing, at last follow-up in the majority of patients who either continued treatment with olanzapine or discontinued olanzapine.

<p>
In placebo-controlled olanzapine monotherapy studies in adolescents, clinically significant ALT elevations (change from &lt;3 times ULN at baseline to â‰¥3 times ULN) were observed in 12% (22/192) of patients exposed to olanzapine compared to 2% (2/109) of patients exposed to placebo.

<h1>DRUG INTERACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>The risks of using olanzapine in combination with other drugs have not been extensively evaluated in systematic studies.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Diazepam</span> â€” The co-administration of diazepam with olanzapine potentiated the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span> observed with olanzapine <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (<a href="#s113">7.2</a>)]</span>.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Cimetidine and Antacids</span> â€” Single doses of cimetidine (800Â mg) or aluminum- and magnesium-containing antacids did not affect the oral bioavailability of olanzapine.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Inducers of CYP1A2</span> â€” Carbamazepine therapy (200Â mgÂ bid) causes an approximately 50% increase in the clearance of olanzapine. This increase is likely due to the fact that carbamazepine is a potent inducer of CYP1A2 activity. Higher daily doses of carbamazepine may cause an even greater increase in olanzapine clearance.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Alcohol</span> â€” Ethanol (45Â mg/70Â kg single dose) did not have an effect on olanzapine pharmacokinetics. The co-administration of alcohol (i.e., ethanol) with olanzapine potentiated the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span> observed with olanzapine <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (<a href="#s113">7.2</a>)]</span>.

<p><span class="Underline">Inhibitors of CYP1A2</span></p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Fluvoxamine:</span> Fluvoxamine, a CYP1A2 inhibitor, decreases the clearance of olanzapine. This results in a mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine of 54% in female <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4222303" conceptname="Non-smoker">nonsmokers</span> and 77% in male smokers. The mean increase in olanzapine AUC is 52% and 108%, respectively. Lower doses of olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving concomitant treatment with fluvoxamine.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Inhibitors of CYP2D6</span></p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Fluoxetine:</span> Fluoxetine (60Â mg single dose or 60Â mg daily dose for 8 days) causes a small (mean 16%) increase in the maximum concentration of olanzapine and a small (mean 16%) decrease in olanzapine clearance. The magnitude of the impact of this factor is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals, and therefore dose modification is not routinely recommended. When using ZYPREXA and fluoxetine in combination, also refer to the Drug Interactions section of the package insert for Symbyax.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Warfarin</span> â€” Warfarin (20Â mg single dose) did not affect olanzapine pharmacokinetics <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (<a href="#s113">7.2</a>)]</span>.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Inducers of CYP1A2 or Glucuronyl Transferase</span> â€” Omeprazole and rifampin may cause an increase in olanzapine clearance.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Charcoal</span> â€” The administration of activated charcoal (1Â g) reduced the Cmax and AUC of oral olanzapine by about 60%. As peak olanzapine levels are not typically obtained until about 6 hours after dosing, charcoal may be a useful treatment for olanzapine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Underline">CNS Acting Drugs</span> â€” Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine, caution should be used when olanzapine is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs and alcohol.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Antihypertensive Agents</span> â€” Olanzapine, because of its potential for inducing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, may enhance the effects of certain antihypertensive agents.

<p><span class="Underline">Levodopa and Dopamine Agonists</span> â€” Olanzapine may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Lorazepam (IM)</span> â€” Administration of intramuscular lorazepam (2Â mg) 1 hour after intramuscular olanzapine for injection (5Â mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine, unconjugated lorazepam, or total lorazepam. However, this co-administration of intramuscular lorazepam and intramuscular olanzapine for injection added to the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> observed with either drug alone <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<a href="#s57">5.8</a>)]</span>.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Lithium</span> â€” Multiple doses of olanzapine (10Â mg for 8 days) did not influence the kinetics of lithium. Therefore, concomitant olanzapine administration does not require dosage adjustment of lithium <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<a href="#s65">5.16</a>)]</span>.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Valproate</span> â€” Olanzapine (10Â mg daily for 2 weeks) did not affect the steady state plasma concentrations of valproate. Therefore, concomitant olanzapine administration does not require dosage adjustment of valproate <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<a href="#s65">5.16</a>)]</span>.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Effect of Olanzapine on Drug Metabolizing Enzymes</span> â€” InÂ vitro studies utilizing human liver microsomes suggest that olanzapine has little potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A. Thus, olanzapine is unlikely to cause clinically important drug interactions mediated by these enzymes.
</p>
<p>

Gestation was prolonged at 10Â mg/kg/day (5 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). In an oral rabbit teratology study, fetal toxicity (manifested as increased resorptions and decreased fetal weight) occurred at a maternally toxic dose of 30Â mg/kg/day (30 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

<p>Olanzapine has not been systematically studied in humans for its potential for abuse, tolerance, or physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>. While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency for any drug-seeking behavior, these observations were not systematic, and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed.

In the patient taking the largest identified amount, 300Â mg, the only symptoms reported were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196636" conceptname="Dysarthria">slurred speech</span>. In the limited number of patients who were evaluated in hospitals, including the patient taking 300Â mg, there were no observations indicating an adverse change in laboratory analytes or ECG. Vital signs were usually within normal limits following <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span>.
</p>
<p>In postmarketing reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> with olanzapine alone, symptoms have been reported in the majority of cases. In symptomatic patients, symptoms with â‰¥10% incidence included <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021344" conceptname="Abusive behavior">aggressiveness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196636" conceptname="Dysarthria">dysarthria</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, various <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373747" conceptname="Extrapyramidal disease">extrapyramidal symptoms</span>, and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>. Among less commonly reported symptoms were the following potentially medically serious reactions: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4256374" conceptname="Cardiorespiratory arrest">cardiopulmonary arrest</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmias</span> (such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275423" conceptname="Supraventricular tachycardia">supraventricular tachycardia</span> and 1 patient experiencing sinus pause with spontaneous resumption of normal rhythm), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373995" conceptname="Delirium">delirium</span>, possible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="379802" conceptname="Neuroleptic malignant syndrome">neuroleptic malignant syndrome</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>/arrest, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsion</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>. Eli Lilly and Company has received reports of fatality in association with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> of olanzapine alone. In 1 case of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>, the amount of acutely ingested olanzapine was reported to be possibly as low as 450Â mg of oral olanzapine; however, in another case, a patient was reported to survive an acute olanzapine ingestion of approximately 2Â g of oral olanzapine.

</p>
<p></p>
<p>The possibility of multiple drug involvement should be considered. In case of acute overdosage, establish and maintain an airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation, which may include intubation. Gastric lavage (after intubation, if patient is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372448" conceptname="Loss of consciousness">unconscious</span>) and administration of activated charcoal together with a laxative should be considered. The administration of activated charcoal (1Â g) reduced the Cmax and AUC of oral olanzapine by about 60%. As peak olanzapine levels are not typically obtained until about 6 hours after dosing, charcoal may be a useful treatment for olanzapine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>.

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>The mechanism of action of olanzapine, as with other drugs having efficacy in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span>, is unknown. However, it has been proposed that this drug's efficacy in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> is mediated through a combination of dopamine and serotonin typeÂ 2Â (5HT2) antagonism. The mechanism of action of olanzapine in the treatment of acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span> or mixed episodes associated with bipolarÂ I disorder is unknown.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Olanzapine binds with high affinity to the following receptors: serotoninÂ 5HT<span class="Sub">2A/2C</span>, 5HT<span class="Sub">6</span> (K<span class="Sub">i</span>=4, 11, and 5Â nM, respectively), dopamineÂ D<span class="Sub">1-4</span> (K<span class="Sub">i</span>=11-31Â nM), histamineÂ H<span class="Sub">1</span> (K<span class="Sub">i</span>=7Â nM), and adrenergicÂ Î±<span class="Sub">1</span> receptors (K<span class="Sub">i</span>=19Â nM). Olanzapine is an antagonist with moderate affinity binding for serotoninÂ 5HT<span class="Sub">3</span> (K<span class="Sub">i</span>=57Â nM) and muscarinicÂ M<span class="Sub">1-5</span> (K<span class="Sub">i</span>=73, 96, 132, 32, and 48Â nM, respectively). Olanzapine binds weakly to GABA<span class="Sub">A</span>, BZD, and Î²-adrenergic receptors (K<span class="Sub">i</span>&gt;10Â Î¼M).
</p>
<p>Antagonism at receptors other than dopamine and 5HT<span class="Sub">2</span> may explain some of the other therapeutic and side effects of olanzapine. Olanzapine's antagonism of muscarinicÂ M<span class="Sub">1-5</span> receptors may explain its anticholinergic-like effects. Olanzapine's antagonism of histamineÂ H<span class="Sub">1</span> receptors may explain the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> observed with this drug. Olanzapine's antagonism of adrenergicÂ Î±<span class="Sub">1</span> receptors may explain the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span> observed with this drug.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Oral Administration, Monotherapy</span> â€” Olanzapine is well absorbed and reaches peak concentrations in approximately 6 hours following an oral dose. It is eliminated extensively by first pass metabolism, with approximately 40% of the dose metabolized before reaching the systemic circulation. Food does not affect the rate or extent of olanzapine absorption. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that ZYPREXA tablets and ZYPREXA ZYDIS (olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets) dosage forms of olanzapine are bioequivalent.
</p>
<p>Olanzapine displays linear kinetics over the clinical dosing range. Its half-life ranges from 21 to 54 hours (5th to 95th percentile; mean of 30Â hr), and apparent plasma clearance ranges from 12 to 47Â L/hr (5th to 95th percentile; mean of 25Â L/hr).
</p>
<p>Administration of olanzapine once daily leads to steady-state concentrations in about 1 week that are approximately twice the concentrations after single doses. Plasma concentrations, half-life, and clearance of olanzapine may vary between individuals on the basis of smoking status, gender, and age.
</p>
<p>Olanzapine is extensively distributed throughout the body, with a volume of distribution of approximately 1000Â L. It is 93% bound to plasma proteins over the concentration range of 7 to 1100Â ng/mL, binding primarily to albumin and Î±<span class="Sub">1</span>-acid glycoprotein.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Metabolism and Elimination</span> â€” Following a single oral dose of <span class="Sup">14</span>CÂ labeled olanzapine, 7% of the dose of olanzapine was recovered in the urine as unchanged drug, indicating that olanzapine is highly metabolized. Approximately 57% and 30% of the dose was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. In the plasma, olanzapine accounted for only 12% of the AUC for total radioactivity, indicating significant exposure to metabolites. After multiple dosing, the major circulating metabolites were the 10-N-glucuronide, present at steady state at 44% of the concentration of olanzapine, and 4â€²-N-desmethyl olanzapine, present at steady state at 31% of the concentration of olanzapine. Both metabolites lack pharmacological activity at the concentrations observed.
</p>
<p>Direct glucuronidation and cytochromeÂ P450Â (CYP) mediated oxidation are the primary metabolic pathways for olanzapine. InÂ vitro studies suggest that CYPsÂ 1A2 and 2D6, and the flavin-containing monooxygenase system are involved in olanzapine oxidation. CYP2D6 mediated oxidation appears to be a minor metabolic pathway inÂ vivo, because the clearance of olanzapine is not reduced in subjects who are deficient in this enzyme.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Intramuscular Administration</span> â€” ZYPREXA IntraMuscular results in rapid absorption with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 15 to 45 minutes. Based upon a pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers, a 5Â mg dose of intramuscular olanzapine for injection produces, on average, a maximum plasma concentration approximately 5 times higher than the maximum plasma concentration produced by a 5Â mg dose of oral olanzapine. Area under the curve achieved after an intramuscular dose is similar to that achieved after oral administration of the same dose. The half-life observed after intramuscular administration is similar to that observed after oral dosing. The pharmacokinetics are linear over the clinical dosing range. Metabolic profiles after intramuscular administration are qualitatively similar to metabolic profiles after oral administration.

</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Underline"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal Impairment</span></span> â€” Because olanzapine is highly metabolized before excretion and only 7% of the drug is excreted unchanged, renal dysfunction alone is unlikely to have a major impact on the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of olanzapine were similar in patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> and normal subjects, indicating that dosage adjustment based upon the degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> is not required. In addition, olanzapine is not removed by dialysis. The effect of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> on metabolite elimination has not been studied.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Underline"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic Impairment</span></span> â€” Although the presence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> may be expected to reduce the clearance of olanzapine, a study of the effect of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4326594" conceptname="Abnormal liver function">impaired liver function</span> in subjects (n=6) with clinically significant (Childs Pugh ClassificationÂ A andÂ B) cirrhosis revealed little effect on the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Geriatric</span> â€” In a study involving 24 healthy subjects, the mean elimination half-life of olanzapine was about 1.5 times greater in elderly (â‰¥65 years) than in nonelderly subjects (&lt;65 years). Caution should be used in dosing the elderly, especially if there are other factors that might additively influence drug metabolism and/or pharmacodynamic sensitivity <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (<a href="#s12">2</a>)]</span>.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Gender</span> â€” Clearance of olanzapine is approximately 30% lower in women than in men. There were, however, no apparent differences between men and women in effectiveness or adverse effects. Dosage modifications based on gender should not be needed.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Smoking Status</span> â€” Olanzapine clearance is about 40% higher in smokers than in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4222303" conceptname="Non-smoker">nonsmokers</span>, although dosage modifications are not routinely recommended.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Race</span> â€” InÂ vivo studies have shown that exposures are similar among Japanese, Chinese and Caucasians, especially after normalization for body weight differences. Dosage modifications for race are, therefore, not recommended.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Combined Effects</span> â€” The combined effects of age, smoking, and gender could lead to substantial pharmacokinetic differences in populations. The clearance in young smoking males, for example, may be 3 times higher than that in elderly nonsmoking females. Dosing modification may be necessary in patients who exhibit a combination of factors that may result in slower metabolism of olanzapine <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (<a href="#s12">2</a>)]</span>.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Adolescents (ages 13 to 17 years)</span> â€” In clinical studies, most adolescents were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4222303" conceptname="Non-smoker">nonsmokers</span> and this population had a lower average body weight, which resulted in higher average olanzapine exposure compared to adults.

<h1>NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Carcinogenesis</span> â€” Oral carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats. Olanzapine was administered to mice in two 78-week studies at doses of 3, 10, 30/20Â mg/kg/day (equivalent to 0.8-5Â times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) and 0.25, 2, 8Â mg/kg/day (equivalent to 0.06-2Â times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). Rats were dosed for 2 years at doses of 0.25, 1, 2.5, 4Â mg/kg/day (males) and 0.25, 1, 4, 8Â mg/kg/day (females) (equivalent to 0.13-2 and 0.13-4 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, respectively). The incidence of liver <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441818" conceptname="Hemangioma">hemangiomas</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4297200" conceptname="Angiosarcoma">hemangiosarcomas</span> was significantly increased in 1 mouse study in female mice dosed at 8Â mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). These tumors were not increased in another mouse study in females dosed at 10 or 30/20Â mg/kg/day (2-5 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis); in this study, there was a high incidence of early mortalities in males of the 30/20Â mg/kg/day group. The incidence of mammary gland <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> and adenocarcinomas was significantly increased in female mice dosed at â‰¥2Â mg/kg/day and in female rats dosed at â‰¥4Â mg/kg/day (0.5 and 2 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, respectively). Antipsychotic drugs have been shown to chronically elevate prolactin levels in rodents. Serum prolactin levels were not measured during the olanzapine carcinogenicity studies; however, measurements during subchronic toxicity studies showed that olanzapine elevated serum prolactin levels up to 4-fold in rats at the same doses used in the carcinogenicity study. An increase in mammary gland neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and is considered to be prolactin mediated. The relevance for human risk of the finding of prolactin mediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unknown <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<a href="#s64">5.15</a>)]</span>.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Mutagenesis</span> â€” No evidence of genotoxic potential for olanzapine was found in the Ames reverse mutation test, inÂ vivo micronucleus test in mice, the chromosomal aberration test in Chinese hamster ovary cells, unscheduled DNA synthesis test in rat hepatocytes, induction of forward mutation test in mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> cells, or inÂ vivo sister chromatid exchange test in bone marrow of Chinese hamsters.
</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Impairment of Fertility</span> â€” In an oral fertility and reproductive performance study in rats, male mating performance, but not fertility, was impaired at a dose of 22.4Â mg/kg/day and female fertility was decreased at a dose of 3Â mg/kg/day (11 and 1.5 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, respectively). Discontinuance of olanzapine treatment reversed the effects on male mating performance. In female rats, the precoital period was increased and the mating index reduced at 5Â mg/kg/day (2.5 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). Diestrous was prolonged and estrous delayed at 1.1Â mg/kg/day (0.6 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis); therefore olanzapine may produce a delay in ovulation.

<p>In animal studies with olanzapine, the principal hematologic findings were reversible peripheral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4179922" conceptname="Cytopenia">cytopenias</span> in individual dogs dosed at 10Â mg/kg (17 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis), dose-related decreases in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4148615" conceptname="Neutrophil count">neutrophils</span> in mice, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441541" conceptname="Lymphocytopenia">lymphopenia</span> in rats.

Nonspecific <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441541" conceptname="Lymphocytopenia">lymphopenia</span>, consistent with decreased body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span>, occurred in rats receiving 22.5Â mg/kg (11 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) for 3 months or 16Â mg/kg (8 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) for 6 or 12 months. No evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found in any of the species examined. Bone marrows were normocellular or hypercellular, indicating that the reductions in circulating blood cells were probably due to peripheral (non-marrow) factors.

A single haloperidol arm was included as a comparative treatment in 1 of the 2 trials, but this trial did not compare these 2 drugs on the full range of clinically relevant doses for both.
</p>
<p>Several instruments were used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms in these studies, among them the Brief Psychiatric Rating ScaleÂ (BPRS), a multi-item inventory of general psychopathology traditionally used to evaluate the effects of drug treatment in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span>. The BPRS <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychosis</span> cluster (conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, suspiciousness, and unusual thought content) is considered a particularly useful subset for assessing actively <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychotic</span> schizophrenic patients. A second traditional assessment, the Clinical Global ImpressionÂ (CGI), reflects the impression of a skilled observer, fully familiar with the manifestations of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span>, about the overall clinical state of the patient. In addition, 2 more recently developed scales were employed; these included the 30-item Positive and Negative Symptoms ScaleÂ (PANSS), in which are embedded the 18 items of the BPRS, and the Scale for Assessing Negative SymptomsÂ (SANS). The trial summaries below focus on the following outcomes: PANSS total and/or BPRS total; BPRS <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychosis</span> cluster; PANSS negative subscale or SANS; and CGI Severity. The results of the trials follow:
</p>
<p>(1) In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial (n=149) involving 2 fixed olanzapine doses of 1 and 10Â mg/day (once daily schedule), olanzapine, at 10Â mg/day (but not at 1Â mg/day), was superior to placebo on the PANSS total score (also on the extracted BPRS total), on the BPRS <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychosis</span> cluster, on the PANSS Negative subscale, and on CGI Severity.
</p>
<p>(2) In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial (n=253) involving 3 fixed dose ranges of olanzapine (5Â Â±Â 2.5Â mg/day, 10Â Â±Â 2.5Â mg/day, and 15Â Â±Â 2.5Â mg/day) on a once daily schedule, the 2 highest olanzapine dose groups (actual mean doses of 12 and 16Â mg/day, respectively) were superior to placebo on BPRS total score, BPRS <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychosis</span> cluster, and CGI severity score; the highest olanzapine dose group was superior to placebo on the SANS. There was no clear advantage for the high-dose group over the medium-dose group.
</p>
<p>(3) In a longer-term trial, adult outpatients (n=326) who predominantly met DSM-IV criteria for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> and who remained stable on olanzapine during open-label treatment for at least 8 weeks were randomized to continuation on their current olanzapine doses (ranging from 10 to 20Â mg/day) or to placebo. The follow-up period to observe patients for relapse, defined in terms of increases in BPRS positive symptoms or hospitalization, was planned for 12 months, however, criteria were met for stopping the trial early due to an excess of placebo relapses compared to olanzapine relapses, and olanzapine was superior to placebo on time to relapse, the primary outcome for this study. Thus, olanzapine was more effective than placebo at maintaining efficacy in patients stabilized for approximately 8 weeks and followed for an observation period of up to 8 months.
</p>
<p>Examination of population subsets (race and gender) did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of these subgroupings.

<p>The efficacy of oral olanzapine in the acute treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> in adolescents (ages 13 to 17 years) was established in a 6-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of inpatients and outpatients with schizophreniaÂ (n=107) who met diagnostic criteria according to DSM-IV-TR and confirmed by the Kiddie Schedule for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="444100" conceptname="Mood disorder">Affective Disorders</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">Schizophrenia</span> for School Aged Children-Present and Lifetime VersionÂ (K-SADS-PL).
</p>
<p>The primary rating instrument used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms in this trial was the Anchored Version of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale for ChildrenÂ (BPRS-C) total score.
</p>
<p>In this flexible-dose trial, olanzapine 2.5 to 20Â mg/day (mean modal dose 12.5Â mg/day, mean dose of 11.1Â mg/day) was more effective than placebo in the treatment of adolescents diagnosed with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span>, as supported by the statistically significantly greater mean reduction in BPRS-C total score for patients in the olanzapine treatment group than in the placebo group.
</p>
<p>While there is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the adolescent patient treated with ZYPREXA should be maintained, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of olanzapine pharmacokinetic parameters in adult and adolescent patients. It is generally recommended that responding patients be continued beyond the acute response, but at the lowest dose needed to maintain remission. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment.

<p>The primary rating instrument used for assessing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span> symptoms in these trials was the Young <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">Mania</span> Rating ScaleÂ (Y-MRS), an 11-item clinician-rated scale traditionally used to assess the degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span> symptomatology (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, disruptive/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021344" conceptname="Abusive behavior">aggressive behavior</span>, sleep, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4304866" conceptname="Elevated mood">elevated mood</span>, speech, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">increased activity</span>, sexual interest, language/thought disorder, thought content, appearance, and insight) in a range from 0 (no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span> features) to 60 (maximum score). The primary outcome in these trials was change from baseline in the Y-MRS total score. The results of the trials follow:
</p>
<p>(1) In one 3-week placebo-controlled trial (n=67) which involved a dose range of olanzapine (5-20Â mg/day, once daily, starting at 10Â mg/day), olanzapine was superior to placebo in the reduction of Y-MRS total score. In an identically designed trial conducted simultaneously with the first trial, olanzapine demonstrated a similar treatment difference, but possibly due to sample size and site variability, was not shown to be superior to placebo on this outcome.
</p>
<p>(2) In a 4-week placebo-controlled trial (n=115) which involved a dose range of olanzapine (5-20Â mg/day, once daily, starting at 15Â mg/day), olanzapine was superior to placebo in the reduction of Y-MRS total score.
</p>
<p>(3) In another trial, 361 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span> or mixed episode of bipolarÂ I disorder who had responded during an initial open-label treatment phase for about 2 weeks, on average, to olanzapine 5 to 20Â mg/day were randomized to either continuation of olanzapine at their same dose (n=225) or to placebo (n=136), for observation of relapse. Approximately 50% of the patients had discontinued from the olanzapine group by day 59 and 50% of the placebo group had discontinued by day 23 of double-blind treatment. Response during the open-label phase was defined by having a decrease of the Y-MRS total score to â‰¤12 and HAM-DÂ 21 to â‰¤8. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as an increase of the Y-MRS or HAM-DÂ 21 total score to â‰¥15, or being hospitalized for either <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">mania</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>. In the randomized phase, patients receiving continued olanzapine experienced a significantly longer time to relapse.

Patients enrolled in the trials needed to be: (1)Â judged by the clinical investigators as clinically <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitated</span> and clinically appropriate candidates for treatment with intramuscular medication, and (2)Â exhibiting a level of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span> that met or exceeded a threshold score of â‰¥14 on the 5 items comprising the Positive and Negative Syndrome ScaleÂ (PANSS) Excited Component (i.e., poor impulse control, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4200706" conceptname="Tension">tension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4195585" conceptname="Hostile behavior">hostility</span>, uncooperativeness and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">excitement</span> items) with at least 1 individual item score â‰¥4 using a 1-7 scoring system (1=absent, 4=moderate, 7=extreme). In the studies, the mean baseline PANSS Excited Component score was 18.4, with scores ranging from 13 to 32 (out of a maximum score of 35), thus suggesting predominantly moderate levels of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span> with some patients experiencing mild or severe levels of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>. The primary efficacy measure used for assessing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span> signs and symptoms in these trials was the change from baseline in the PANSS Excited Component at 2 hours post-injection.

ZYPREXA and some medicines may interact with each other and may not work as well, or cause possible serious side effects.

</p>
<p><span class="Bold">How should I take ZYPREXA?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Take ZYPREXA exactly as prescribed. Your doctor may need to change (adjust) the dose of ZYPREXA until it is right for you.
</li>
<li>If you miss a dose of ZYPREXA, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for the next dose, just skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the regular time. Do not take two doses of ZYPREXA at the same time.
</li>
<li><span class="Bold">To prevent serious side effects, do not stop taking ZYPREXA suddenly. If you need to stop taking ZYPREXA, your doctor can tell you how to safely stop taking it.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bold">If you take too much ZYPREXA, call your doctor or poison control center at 1-800-222-1222 right away, or get emergency treatment.</span></li>
<li>ZYPREXA can be taken with or without food.
</li>
<li>ZYPREXA is usually taken one time each day.
</li>
<li>Take ZYPREXA ZYDIS as follows:<ul>

</li>
<li>Open the sachet and peel back the foil on the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443720" conceptname="Blister">blister</span>. Do not push the tablet through the foil.
</li>
<li>As soon as you open the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443720" conceptname="Blister">blister</span>, remove the tablet and put it into your mouth.
</li>
<li>The tablet will disintegrate quickly in your saliva so that you can easily swallow it with or without drinking liquid.
