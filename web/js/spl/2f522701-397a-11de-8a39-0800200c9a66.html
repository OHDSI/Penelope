<h2>Mechanism of Action:</h2>
<p class="First">The mechanism by which felbamate exerts its
									anticonvulsant activity is unknown, but in animal test systems
									designed to detect anticonvulsant activity, felbamate has
									properties in common with other marketed anticonvulsants.
									Felbamate is effective in mice and rats in the maximal
									electroshock test, the subcutaneous pentylenetetrazol <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span>
									test, and the subcutaneous picrotoxin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> test. Felbamate
									also exhibits anticonvulsant activity against <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> induced
									by intracerebroventricular administration of glutamate in rats
									and N-methyl-D,L-aspartic acid in mice. Protection against
									maximal electroshock-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> suggests that felbamate
									may reduce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> spread, an effect possibly predictive of
									efficacy in generalized tonic-clonic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106574" conceptname="Partial seizure">partial seizures</span>.
									Protection against pentylenetetrazol-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> suggests
									that felbamate may increase <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> threshold, an effect
									considered to be predictive of potential efficacy in absence
									<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>.</p>
<p>Receptor-binding studies <span class="Italics">in
										vitro</span> indicate that felbamate has weak inhibitory
									effects on GABA-receptor binding, benzodiazepine receptor
									binding, and is devoid of activity at the MK-801 receptor
									binding site of the NMDA receptor-ionophore complex. However,
									felbamate does interact as an antagonist at the
									strychnine-insensitive glycine recognition site of the NMDA
									receptor-ionophore complex. Felbamate is not effective in
									protecting chick embryo retina tissue against the neurotoxic
									effects of the excitatory amino acid agonists NMDA, kainate, or
									quisqualate <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>. </p>
<p>The monocarbamate, p-hydroxy, and 2-hydroxy metabolites
									were inactive in the maximal electroshock-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> test
									in mice. The monocarbamate and p-hydroxy metabolites had only
									weak (0.2 to 0.6) activity compared with felbamate in the
									subcutaneous pentylenetetrazol <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> test. These metabolites
									did not contribute significantly to the anticonvulsant action of
									felbamate.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics:</h2>
<p class="First">The numbers in the pharmacokinetic section are mean
									± standard deviation. </p>
<p>Felbamate is well-absorbed after oral administration.
									Over 90% of the radioactivity after a dose of 1000 mg
										<span class="Sup">14</span> C felbamate was found in the urine. Absolute
									bioavailability (oral vs. parenteral) has not been measured. The
									tablet and suspension were each shown to be bioequivalent to the
									capsule used in clinical trials, and pharmacokinetic parameters
									of the tablet and suspension are similar. There was no effect of
									food on absorption of the tablet; the effect of food on
									absorption of the suspension has not been evaluated.</p>
<p>Following oral administration, felbamate is the
									predominant plasma species (about 90% of plasma
									radioactivity). About 40-50% of absorbed dose appears
									unchanged in urine, and an additional 40% is present as
									unidentified metabolites and conjugates. About 15% is
									present as parahydroxyfelbamate, 2-hydroxyfelbamate, and
									felbamate monocarbamate, none of which have significant
									anticonvulsant activity.</p>
<p>Binding of felbamate to human plasma protein was
									independent of felbamate concentrations between 10 and 310
									micrograms/mL. Binding ranged from 22% to 25%,
									mostly to albumin, and was dependent on the albumin
									concentration.</p>
<p>Felbamate is excreted with a terminal half-life of 20-23
									hours, which is unaltered after multiple doses. Clearance after
									a single 1200 mg dose is 26±3 mL/hr/kg, and after
									multiple daily doses of 3600 mg is 30±8 mL/hr/kg. The
									apparent volume of distribution was 756±82 mL/kg after
									a 1200 mg dose. Felbamate Cmax and AUC are proportionate to dose
									after single and multiple doses over a range of 100-800 mg
									single doses and 1200-3600 mg daily doses. Cmin (trough) blood
									levels are also dose proportional. Multiple daily doses of 1200,
									2400, and 3600 mg gave Cmin values of 30±5,
									55±8, and 83±21 micrograms/mL (N=10 patients).
									Linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics were also observed
									at doses above 3600 mg/day up to the maximum dose studied of
									6000 mg/day. Felbamate gave dose proportional steady-state peak
									plasma concentrations in children age 4-12 over a range of 15,
									30, and 45 mg/kg/day with peak concentrations of 17, 32, and 49
									micrograms/mL.</p>
<p>The effects of race and gender on felbamate
									pharmacokinetics have not been systematically evaluated, but
									plasma concentrations in males (N=5) and females (N=4) given
									felbamate have been similar. The effects of felbamate kinetics
									on hepatic functional impairment have not been evaluated.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal Impairment</span>:</span><br>Felbamate's single dose monotherapy pharmacokinetic parameters
									were evaluated in 12 otherwise healthy individuals with renal
									impairment. There was a 40-50% reduction in total body
									clearance and 9-15 hours prolongation of half-life in renally
									impaired subjects compared to that in subjects with normal renal
									function. Reduced felbamate clearance and a longer half-life
									were associated with diminishing renal function.</p>

<h2>Pharmacodynamics:</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Typical Physiologic
										Responses:</span><br> 1. <span class="Italics">Cardiovascular:</span> In adults, there is no effect of
									felbamate on blood pressure. Small but statistically significant
									mean increases in heart rate were seen during adjunctive therapy
									and monotherapy; however, these mean increases of up to 5 bpm
									were not clinically significant. In children, no clinically
									relevant changes in blood pressure or heart rate were seen
									during adjunctive therapy or monotherapy with felbamate.</p>
<p>2. <span class="Italics">Other Physiologic
										Effects:</span> The only other change in vital signs was
									a mean decrease of approximately 1 respiration per minute in
									<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4313591" conceptname="Respiratory rate">respiratory rate</span> during adjunctive therapy in children. In
									adults, statistically significant mean reductions in body weight
									were observed during felbamate monotherapy and adjunctive
									therapy. In children, there were mean decreases in body weight
									during adjunctive therapy and monotherapy; however, these mean
									changes were not statistically significant. These mean
									reductions in adults and children were approximately 5% of the
									mean weights at baseline. </p>

<h2>Felbatol® Monotherapy
								Trials in Adults</h2>
<p class="First">Felbatol® (3600 mg/day given QID) and low-dose
									valproate (15 mg/kg/day) were compared as monotherapy during a
									112-day treatment period in a multicenter and a single-center
									double-blind efficacy trial. Both trials were conducted
									according to an identical study design. During a 56-day baseline
									period, all patients had at least four partial-onset <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>
									per 28 days and were receiving one antiepileptic drug at a
									therapeutic level, the most common being carbamazepine. In the
									multicenter trial, baseline <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> frequencies were 12.4 per 28
									days in the Felbatol® group and 21.3 per 28 days in the
									low-dose valproate group. In the single-center trial, baseline
									<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> frequencies were 18.1 per 28 days in the
									Felbatol® group and 15.9 per 28 days in the low-dose
									valproate group. Patients were converted to monotherapy with
									Felbatol® or low-dose valproic acid during the first 28
									days of the 112-day treatment period. Study endpoints were
									completion of 112 study days or fulfilling an escape criterion.
									Criteria for escape relative to baseline were: (1) twofold
									increase in monthly <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> frequency, (2) twofold increase in
									highest 2-day <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> frequency, (3) single generalized
									tonic-clonic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> (GTC) if none occurred during baseline, or
									(4) significant prolongation of GTCs. The primary efficacy
									variable was the number of patients in each treatment group who
									met escape criteria.</p>
<p>In the multicenter trial, the percentage of patients who
									met escape criteria was 40% (18/45) in the
									Felbatol® group and 78% (39/50) in the low-dose
									valproate group. In the single-center trial, the percentage of
									patients who met escape criteria was 14% (3/21) in the
									Felbatol® group and 90% (19/21) in the low-dose
									valproate group. In both trials, the difference in the
									percentage of patients meeting escape criteria was statistically
									significant (P&lt;.001) in favor of Felbatol®.

<h2>Felbatol® Adjunctive
								Therapy Trials in Adults</h2>
<p class="First">A double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial
									consisted of two 10-week outpatient treatment periods. Patients
									with refractory partial-onset <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> who were receiving
									phenytoin and carbamazepine at therapeutic levels were
									administered Felbatol® (felbamate) as add-on therapy at
									a starting dosage of 1400 mg/day in three divided doses, which
									was increased to 2600 mg/day in three divided doses. Among the
									56 patients who completed the study, the baseline <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span>
									frequency was 20 per month. Patients treated with
									Felbatol® had fewer <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> than patients treated with
									placebo for each treatment sequence. There was a 23%
									(P=.018) difference in percentage <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> frequency reduction in
									favor of Felbatol®.</p>
<p>Felbatol® 3600 mg/day given QID and placebo were
									compared in a 28-day double-blind add-on trial in patients who
									had their standard antiepileptic drugs reduced while undergoing
									evaluations for surgery of intractable <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>. All patients

<h2>Felbatol® Adjunctive
								Therapy Trial in Children with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome</h2>
<p class="First">In a 70-day double-blind, placebo-controlled add-on trial
									in the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Felbatol® 45 mg/kg/day
									given QID was superior to placebo in controlling the multiple
									<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> types associated with this condition. Patients had at
									least 90 atonic and/or atypical absence <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> per month while
									receiving therapeutic dosages of one or two other antiepileptic
									drugs. Patients had a past history of using an average of eight
									antiepileptic drugs. The most commonly used antiepileptic drug
									during the baseline period was valproic acid. The frequency of
									all types of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> during the baseline period was 1617 per
									month in the Felbatol® group and 716 per month in the
									placebo group. Statistically significant differences in the
									effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> frequency favored Felbatol® over
									placebo for total <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> (26% reduction vs. 5%
									increase, P&lt;.001), atonic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> (44% reduction

									significantly (P&lt;.001) favored Felbatol® over
									placebo.</p>
<p>When efficacy was analyzed by gender in four
									well-controlled trials of felbamate as adjunctive and
									monotherapy for partial-onset <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> and Lennox-Gastaut

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Felbatol® is not indicated as a first line antiepileptic
							treatment (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#KS0602f522701-397a-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66">Warnings</a></span>). Felbatol® is recommended for use only in those

							<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">liver failure</span> is deemed acceptable in light of the benefits conferred by
							its use.</p>
<p>If these criteria are met and the patient has been fully advised
							of the risk, and has provided written acknowledgement,
							Felbatol® can be considered for either monotherapy or

<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322252" conceptname="Suicidal behavior">Suicidal Behavior</span> and
							Ideation</span><br> Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) including Felbatol
							®, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in
							patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with
							any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or
							worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any
							unusual changes in mood or behavior.</p>
<p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono-
							and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients
							randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted
							Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or
							behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials,
							which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated
							incidence rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322252" conceptname="Suicidal behavior">suicidal behavior</span> or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated
							patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029
							placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one
							case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated.
							There were four <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> in drug-treated patients in the trials and none
							in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any
							conclusion about drug effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>. </p>
<p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was
							observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs
							and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most
							trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk
							of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</p>
<p>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally
							consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased
							risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of
							indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any
							indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in
							the clinical trials analyzed.</p>

<p><span class="Bold Italics">Specific Effects of
										Felbatol® on Other Antiepileptic Drugs:</span><br><span class="Bold Underline">Phenytoin:</span>
									Felbatol® causes an increase in steady-state phenytoin
									plasma concentrations. In 10 otherwise healthy subjects with
									<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> ingesting phenytoin, the steady-state trough (Cmin)
									phenytoin plasma concentration was 17±5 micrograms/mL.
									The steady-state Cmin increased to 21±5 micrograms/mL
									when 1200 mg/day of felbamate was coadministered. Increasing the
									felbamate dose to 1800 mg/day in six of these subjects increased
									the steady-state phenytoin Cmin to 25±7 micrograms/mL.
									In order to maintain phenytoin levels, limit adverse
									experiences, and achieve the felbamate dose of 3600 mg/day, a
									phenytoin dose reduction of approximately 40% was
									necessary for eight of these 10 subjects.</p>
<p>In a controlled clinical trial, a 20% reduction
									of the phenytoin dose at the initiation of Felbatol®
									therapy resulted in phenytoin levels comparable to those prior
									to Felbatol® administration.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Underline">Carbamazepine:</span> Felbatol® causes a decrease
									in the steady-state carbamazepine plasma concentrations and an
									increase in the steady-state carbamazepine epoxide plasma
									concentration. In nine otherwise healthy subjects with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>
									ingesting carbamazepine, the steady-state trough (Cmin)
									carbamazepine concentration was 8±2 micrograms/mL. The
									carbamazepine steady-state Cmin decreased 31% to
									5±1 micrograms/mL when felbamate (3000 mg/day, divided
									into three doses) was coadministered. Carbamazepine epoxide
									steady-state Cmin concentrations increased 57% from
									1.0±0.3 to 1.6±0.4 micrograms/mL with the
									addition of felbamate.</p>
<p>In clinical trials, similar changes in carbamazepine and
									carbamazepine epoxide were seen.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Underline">Valproate:</span>
									Felbatol® causes an increase in steady-state valproate
									concentrations. In four subjects with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> ingesting
									valproate, the steady-state trough (Cmin) valproate plasma
									concentration was 63±16 micrograms/mL. The steady-state
									Cmin increased to 78±14 micrograms/mL when 1200 mg/day
									of felbamate was coadministered. Increasing the felbamate dose
									to 2400 mg/day increased the steady-state valproate Cmin to
									96±25 micrograms/mL. Corresponding values for free
									valproate Cmin concentrations were 7±3, 9±4,
									and 11±6 micrograms/mL for 0, 1200, and 2400 mg/day
									Felbatol®, respectively. The ratios of the AUCs of
									unbound valproate to the AUCs of the total valproate were
									11.1%, 13.0%, and 11.5%, with
									coadministration of 0, 1200, and 2400 mg/day of
									Felbatol®, respectively. This indicates that the
									protein binding of valproate did not change appreciably with
									increasing doses of Felbatol®. </p>
<p><span class="Bold Underline">Phenobarbital:</span> Coadministration of felbamate with
									phenobarbital causes an increase in phenobarbital plasma
									concentrations. In 12 otherwise healthy male volunteers
									ingesting phenobarbital, the steady-state trough (Cmin)
									phenobarbital concentration was 14.2 micrograms/mL. The
									steady-state Cmin concentration increased to 17.8 micrograms/mL
									when 2400 mg/day of felbamate was coadministered for one week.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Effects of Other
										Antiepileptic Drugs on Felbatol®:</span><br><span class="Bold Underline">Phenytoin:</span>
									Phenytoin causes an approximate doubling of the clearance of
									Felbatol® (felbamate) at steady-state and, therefore,
									the addition of phenytoin causes an approximate 45%
									decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of
									Felbatol® as compared to the same dose of
									Felbatol® given as monotherapy.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Underline">Carbamazepine:</span> Carbamazepine causes an approximate
									50% increase in the clearance of Felbatol® at
									steady-state and, therefore, the addition of carbamazepine
									results in an approximate 40% decrease in the
									steady-state trough concentrations of Felbatol® as
									compared to the same dose of Felbatol® given as
									monotherapy. </p>
<p><span class="Bold Underline">Valproate:</span>
									Available data suggest that there is no significant effect of
									valproate on the clearance of Felbatol® at
									steady-state. Therefore, the addition of valproate is not
									expected to cause a clinically important effect on
									Felbatol® (felbamate) plasma concentrations.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Underline">Phenobarbital:</span> It appears that phenobarbital may
									reduce plasma felbamate concentrations. Steady-state plasma
									felbamate concentrations were found to be 29% lower than
									the mean concentrations of a group of newly diagnosed subjects
									with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> also receiving 2400 mg of felbamate a day.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Effects of Antacids on
										Felbatol®:</span><br> The rate and extent of
									absorption of a 2400 mg dose of Felbatol® as
									monotherapy given as tablets was not affected when
									coadministered with antacids.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Effects of Erythromycin on
										Felbatol®:</span><br> The coadministration of
									erythromycin (1000 mg/day) for 10 days did not alter the
									pharmacokinetic parameters of Cmax, Cmin, AUC, Cl/kg or tmax at
									felbamate daily doses of 3000 or 3600 mg/day in 10 otherwise
									healthy subjects with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Effects of Felbatol®
										on Low-Dose Combination Oral Contraceptives:</span><br> A group of 24 nonsmoking, healthy white female volunteers
									established on an oral contraceptive regimen containing 30
									µg ethinyl estradiol and 75 µg gestodene for
									at least 3 months received 2400 mg/day of felbamate from
									midcycle (day 15) to midcycle (day 14) of two consecutive oral
									contraceptive cycles. Felbamate treatment resulted in a
									42% decrease in the gestodene AUC 0-24, but no
									clinically relevant effect was observed on the pharmacokinetic
									parameters of ethinyl estradiol. No volunteer showed hormonal
									evidence of ovulation, but one volunteer reported intermenstrual

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis,
										Impairment of Fertility:</span> Carcinogenicity studies
									were conducted in mice and rats. Mice received felbamate as a
									feed admixture for 92 weeks at doses of 300, 600, and 1200 mg/kg
									and rats were also dosed by feed admixture for 104 weeks at
									doses of 30, 100, and 300 (males) or 10, 30, and 100 (females)
									mg/kg. The maximum doses in these studies produced steady-state

									steady-state plasma concentrations in epileptic patients
									receiving 3600 mg/day. There was a statistically significant

									mice and in high-dose female rats. Hepatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4210465" conceptname="Hypertrophy">hypertrophy</span> was

									benign interstitial cell tumors of the testes in high-dose male
									rats receiving felbamate. The relevance of these findings to
									humans is unknown.</p>
<p>As a result of the synthesis process, felbamate could
									contain small amounts of two known animal carcinogens, the
									genotoxic compound ethyl carbamate (urethane) and the
									nongenotoxic compound methyl carbamate. It is theoretically
									possible that a 50 kg patient receiving 3600 mg of felbamate
									could be exposed to up to 0.72 micrograms of urethane and 1800
									micrograms of methyl carbamate. These daily doses are
									approximately 1/35,000 (urethane) and 1/5,500 (methyl carbamate)
									on a mg/kg basis, and 1/10,000 (urethane) and 1/1,600 (methyl
									carbamate) on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, of the dose levels shown
									to be carcinogenic in rodents. Any presence of these two
									compounds in felbamate used in the lifetime carcinogenicity
									studies was inadequate to cause tumors. </p>

<p>Reproduction and fertility studies in rats showed no

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Felbatol® (felbamate) has been studied as monotherapy
							and adjunctive therapy in adults and as adjunctive therapy in children
							with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. As
							Felbatol® is added to or substituted for existing AEDs, it is
							strongly recommended to reduce the dosage of those AEDs in the range of
							20-33% to minimize side effects (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#KS0722f522701-397a-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66">Drug
									Interactions</a></span> subsection).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Dosage Adjustment in the Renally
								Impaired:</span> Felbamate should be used with caution in
							patients with renal dysfunction. In the renally impaired, starting and
							maintenance doses should be reduced by one-half (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#KS0212f522701-397a-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66">CLINICAL
									PHARMACOLOGY / Pharmacokinetics</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#KS0702f522701-397a-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66">PRECAUTIONS</a></span> ). Adjunctive therapy with medications which affect felbamate
							plasma concentrations, especially AEDs, may warrant further reductions
							in felbamate daily doses in patients with renal dysfunction.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Underline">Adults (14 years of age and
								over)</span><br> The majority of patients received 3600 mg/day
							in clinical trials evaluating its use as both monotherapy and adjunctive
							therapy.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Monotherapy:</span> (Initial
							therapy) Felbatol® (felbamate) has not been systematically
							evaluated as initial monotherapy. Initiate Felbatol® at 1200
							mg/day in divided doses three or four times daily. The prescriber is
							advised to titrate previously untreated patients under close clinical
							supervision, increasing the dosage in 600-mg increments every 2 weeks to
							2400 mg/day based on clinical response and thereafter to 3600 mg/day if
							clinically indicated.</p>
<p><a name="KS1112f522701-397a-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66"></a><span class="Bold Italics">Conversion to Monotherapy:</span>
							Initiate Felbatol® at 1200 mg/day in divided doses three or
							four times daily. Reduce the dosage of concomitant AEDs by one-third at
							initiation of Felbatol® therapy. At week 2, increase the
							Felbatol® dosage to 2400 mg/day while reducing the dosage of
							other AEDs up to an additional one-third of their original dosage. At
							week 3, increase the Felbatol® dosage up to 3600 mg/day and
							continue to reduce the dosage of other AEDs as clinically indicated.</p>
<p><a name="KS1122f522701-397a-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66"></a><span class="Bold Italics">Adjunctive Therapy:</span>
							Felbatol® should be added at 1200 mg/day in divided doses three
							or four times daily while reducing present AEDs by 20% in order
							to control plasma concentrations of concurrent phenytoin, valproic acid,
							phenobarbital, and carbamazepine and its metabolites. Further reductions
							of the concomitant AEDs dosage may be necessary to minimize side effects
							due to drug interactions. Increase the dosage of Felbatol® by
							1200 mg/day increments at weekly intervals to 3600 mg/day. Most side
							effects seen during Felbatol® adjunctive therapy resolve as the
							dosage of concomitant AEDs is decreased.</p>

<p>My [My son, daughter, ward <span class="Underline">                                                   's]</span> treatment with Felbatol® has been personally explained to me by  Dr. <span class="Underline">                                                  .</span> The following points of information, among others, have been specifically discussed and made clear and I have had the opportunity to ask any questions concerning this information: </p>
<p>1. I, <span class="Underline">                                                  </span> (Patient's Name), understand that Felbatol® is used to treat certain types of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> and my physician has told me that I have this type(s) of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>;<br>INITIALS:  <span class="Underline">                                                  </span></p>
<p>2.

<p>4. I understand that there are no laboratory tests which will predict if I am at an increased risk for one of the potentially fatal conditions;<br>INITIALS:  <span class="Underline">                                                  </span></p>
<p>5. I understand that I should have the recommended blood work before my treatment with Felbatol® is begun (baseline) and periodically thereafter as clinical judgement warrants. I understand that although this blood work may help detect if I develop one of these conditions, it may do so only after significant, irreversible and potentially fatal damage has already occurred;<br>INITIALS:  <span class="Underline">                                                  </span></p>
<p>6. If I am currently taking other antiepileptic drugs, I understand that the manufacturer of Felbatol® recommends that the dosage of these other drugs be decreased by a certain amount when Felbatol® is started; if my physician determines that this should not be done in my case, he/she has explained the reason(s) for this decision;<br>INITIALS:  <span class="Underline">                                                  </span></p>
<p>7.
