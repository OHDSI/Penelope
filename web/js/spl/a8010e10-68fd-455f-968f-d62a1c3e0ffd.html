<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY IN ADULTS</h1>
<span class="Italics"><br>GI Effects<br><br></span>Famotidine is a competitive inhibitor of histamine H<span class="Sub">2</span>-receptors. The primary clinically important pharmacologic activity of famotidine is inhibition of gastric secretion. Both the acid concentration and volume of gastric secretion are suppressed by famotidine, while changes in pepsin secretion are proportional to volume output.<br><br>In normal volunteers and hypersecretors, famotidine inhibited basal and nocturnal gastric secretion, as well as secretion stimulated by food and pentagastrin. After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory effect occurred within one hour; the maximum effect was dose-dependent, occurring within one to three hours. Duration of inhibition of secretion by doses of 20 and 40 mg was 10 to 12 hours.<br><br>Single evening oral doses of 20 and 40 mg inhibited basal and nocturnal acid secretion in all subjects; mean nocturnal gastric acid secretion was inhibited by 86% and 94%, respectively, for a period of at least 10 hours. The same doses given in the morning suppressed food-stimulated acid secretion in all subjects. The mean suppression was 76% and 84%, respectively, 3 to 5 hours after administration, and 25% and 30%, respectively, 8 to 10 hours after administration. In some subjects who received the 20-mg dose, however, the antisecretory effect was dissipated within 6 to 8 hours. There was no cumulative effect with repeated doses. The nocturnal intragastric pH was raised by evening doses of 20 and 40 mg of famotidine to mean values of 5.0 and 6.4, respectively. When famotidine was given after breakfast, the basal daytime interdigestive pH at 3 and 8 hours after 20 or 40 mg of famotidine was raised to about 5.<br><br>Famotidine had little or no effect on fasting or postprandial serum gastrin levels. Gastric emptying and exocrine pancreatic function were not affected by famotidine.<br><br><span class="Italics">Other Effects<br><br></span>Systemic effects of famotidine in the CNS, cardiovascular, respiratory or endocrine systems were not noted in clinical pharmacology studies. Also, no antiandrogenic effects were noted. (See <a href="#section-">                                     ADVERSE REACTIONS</a>.) Serum hormone levels, including prolactin, cortisol, thyroxine (T<span class="Sub">4</span>), and testosterone, were not altered after treatment with famotidine.<br><br><span class="Italics">Pharmacokinetics</span><br><br>Famotidine is incompletely absorbed. The bioavailability of oral doses is 40 to 45%. Famotidine Tablets and Famotidine for Oral Suspension are bioequivalent. Bioavailability may be slightly increased by food, or slightly decreased by antacids; however, these effects are of no clinical consequence. Famotidine undergoes minimal first-pass metabolism. After oral doses, peak plasma levels occur in 1 to 3 hours. Plasma levels after multiple doses are similar to those after single doses. Fifteen to 20% of famotidine in plasma is protein bound. Famotidine has an elimination half-life of 2.5 to 3.5 hours. Famotidine is eliminated by renal (65 to 70%) and metabolic (30 to 35%) routes. Renal clearance is 250 to 450 mL/min, indicating some tubular excretion. Twenty-five to 30% of an oral dose and 65 to 70% of an intravenous dose are recovered in the urine as unchanged compound. The only metabolite identified in man is the S-oxide.<br><br>There is a close relationship between creatinine clearance values and the elimination halflife of famotidine. In patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>, i.e., creatinine clearance less than 10 mL/min, the elimination half-life of famotidine may exceed 20 hours and adjustment of dose or dosing intervals in moderate and severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> may be necessary (see <a href="#section-">                                     PRECAUTIONS</a>, <a href="#section-">                                     DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).<br><br>In elderly patients, there are no clinically significant age-related changes in the pharmacokinetics of famotidine. However, in elderly patients with decreased renal function, the clearance of the drug may be decreased (see <a href="#section-">                                     PRECAUTIONS</a>, <span class="Italics">Geriatric Use</span>).<br><br><span class="Italics">Clinical Studies</span><br><br><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4057053" conceptname="Acute duodenal ulcer">Duodenal Ulcer</span></span><br><br>In a U.S. multicenter, double-blind study in outpatients with endoscopically confirmed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4057053" conceptname="Acute duodenal ulcer">duodenal ulcer</span>, orally administered famotidine was compared to placebo.

While no direct fetotoxic effects have been observed, sporadic abortions occurring only in mothers displaying marked decreased food intake were seen in some rabbits at oral doses of 200 mg/kg/day (250 times the usual human dose) or higher.

In contrast, pediatric patients 0 to 3 months of age had famotidine clearance values that were 2- to 4-fold less than those in older pediatric patients and adults. These studies also show that the mean bioavailability in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age after oral dosing is similar to older pediatric patients and adults. Pharmacodynamic data in pediatric patients 0 to 3 months of age suggest that the duration of acid suppression is longer compared with older pediatric patients, consistent with the longer famotidine half-life in pediatric patients 0 to 3 months of age.

Although an intravenous famotidine formulation was available, no patients were treated with intravenous famotidine in this study. Also, caregivers were instructed to provide conservative treatment including thickened feedings. Enrolled patients were diagnosed primarily by history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> (spitting up) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span> (fussiness). The famotidine dosing regimen was once daily for patients less than 3 months of age and twice daily for patients greater than or equal to 3 months of age. After 4 weeks of treatment, patients were randomly withdrawn from the treatment and followed an additional 4 weeks for adverse events and symptomatology. Patients were evaluated for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> (spitting up), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span> (fussiness) and global assessments of improvement. The study patients ranged in age at entry from 1.3 to 10.5 months (mean 5.6 ± 2.9 months), 57% were female, 91% were white and 6% were black. Most patients (27 out of 35) continued into the treatment-withdrawal phase of the study. Two patients discontinued famotidine due to adverse events. Most patients improved during the initial treatment phase of the study. Results of the treatment-withdrawal phase were difficult to interpret because of small numbers of patients. Of the 35 patients enrolled in the study, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span> was observed in 5 patients on famotidine that resolved when the medication was discontinued; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span> was not observed in patients on placebo (see <a href="#section-8"> ADVERSE REACTIONS</a>, <span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients</span>).<br><br>These studies suggest that a starting dose of 0.5 mg/kg/dose of famotidine oral suspension may be of benefit for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318800" conceptname="Gastroesophageal reflux disease">GERD</span> for up to 4 weeks once daily in patients less than 3 months of age and twice daily in patients 3 months to less than 1 year of age; the safety and benefit of famotidine treatment beyond 4 weeks have not been established.

In pediatric patients 11 to 15 years of age, oral doses of 0.5 mg/kg were associated with a mean area under the curve (AUC) similar to that seen in adults treated orally with 40 mg. Similarly, in pediatric patients 1 to 15 years of age, intravenous doses of 0.5 mg/kg were associated with a mean AUC similar to that seen in adults treated intravenously with 40 mg. Limited published studies also suggest that the relationship between serum concentration and acid suppression is similar in pediatric patients 1 to 15 years of age as compared with adults.
