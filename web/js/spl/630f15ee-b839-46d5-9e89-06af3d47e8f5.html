Analyses of seventeen placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> were varied, most of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> appeared to be either cardiovascular (eg, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4132309" conceptname="Sudden death">sudden death</span>) or infectious (eg, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255848" conceptname="Pneumonia">pneumonia</span>) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. ABILIFY (aripiprazole) is not approved for the treatment of patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4182210" conceptname="Dementia">dementia</span>-related <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychosis</span> <span class="Italics">[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS <a href="#Section_5.1">(5.1)</a>]</span>.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of adjunctive ABILIFY or any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>.

<p><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p>
<p>Dose Selection:  The recommended starting and target dose for ABILIFY is 10 mg/day or 15 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. ABILIFY has been systematically evaluated and shown to be effective in a dose range of 10 mg/day to 30 mg/day, when administered as the tablet formulation; however, doses higher than 10 mg/day or 15 mg/day were not more effective than 10 mg/day or 15 mg/day. Dosage increases should generally not be made before 2 weeks, the time needed to achieve steady-state <span class="Italics">[see CLINICAL STUDIES <a href="#Section_14.1">(14.1)</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Maintenance Treatment:  Maintenance of efficacy in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> was demonstrated in a trial involving patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> who had been symptomatically stable on other antipsychotic medications for periods of 3 months or longer. These patients were discontinued from those medications and randomized to either ABILIFY 15 mg/day or placebo, and observed for relapse <span class="Italics">[see CLINICAL STUDIES <a href="#Section_14.1">(14.1)</a>]</span>. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the continued need for maintenance treatment.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Adolescents</span></p>
<p>Dose Selection:  The recommended target dose of ABILIFY is 10 mg/day. Aripiprazole was studied in adolescent patients 13 to 17 years of age with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> at daily doses of 10 mg and 30 mg. The starting daily dose of the tablet formulation in these patients was 2 mg, which was titrated to 5 mg after 2 days and to the target dose of 10 mg after 2 additional days. Subsequent dose increases should be administered in 5 mg increments. The 30 mg/day dose was not shown to be more efficacious than the 10 mg/day dose. ABILIFY can be administered without regard to meals <span class="Italics">[see CLINICAL STUDIES <a href="#Section_14.1">(14.1)</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Maintenance Treatment:  The efficacy of ABILIFY for the maintenance treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> in the adolescent population has not been evaluated. While there is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the adolescent patient treated with ABILIFY should be maintained on the drug, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of aripiprazole pharmacokinetic parameters in adult and pediatric patients. Thus, it is generally recommended that responding patients be continued beyond the acute response, but at the lowest dose needed to maintain remission. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">Switching from Other Antipsychotics</span></p>
<p>There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> from other antipsychotics to ABILIFY or concerning concomitant administration with other antipsychotics. While immediate discontinuation of the previous antipsychotic treatment may be acceptable for some patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span>, more gradual discontinuation may be most appropriate for others. In all cases, the period of overlapping antipsychotic administration should be minimized.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">Acute Treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">Manic</span> and Mixed Episodes</span></p>
<p>Adults: The recommended starting dose in adults is 15 mg given once daily as monotherapy and 10 mg to 15 mg given once daily as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. ABILIFY can be given without regard to meals. The recommended target dose of ABILIFY is 15 mg/day, as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. The dose may be increased to 30 mg/day based on clinical response. The safety of doses above 30 mg/day has not been evaluated in clinical trials.</p>
<p>Pediatrics: The recommended starting dose in pediatric patients (10 to 17 years) as monotherapy is 2 mg/day, with titration to 5 mg/day after 2 days, and a target dose of 10 mg/day after 2 additional days. Recommended dosing as adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate is the same.  Subsequent dose increases, if needed, should be administered in 5 mg/day increments.

<p>If ongoing aripiprazole therapy is clinically indicated, oral aripiprazole in a range of 10 mg/day to 30 mg/day should replace aripiprazole injection as soon as possible <span class="Italics">[see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION <a href="#Section_2.1">(2.1</a> and <a href="#Section_2.2">2.2)</a>]</span>.</p>

<p>Patients with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and/or the emergence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4092095" conceptname="Planning suicide">suicidal ideation</span> and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> is a known risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term, placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18-24) with MDD and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.</p>
<p>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440374" conceptname="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">Obsessive Compulsive Disorder</span> (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 4.

<p>It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, ie, beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.</p>

Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.</p>
<p>Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patientâ€™s presenting symptoms.</p>

<p>A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="379802" conceptname="Neuroleptic malignant syndrome">Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome</span> (NMS) may occur with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including aripiprazole. Rare cases of NMS occurred during aripiprazole treatment in the worldwide clinical database. Clinical manifestations of NMS are <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260205" conceptname="Hyperpyrexia">hyperpyrexia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4050941" conceptname="Muscle rigidity">muscle rigidity</span>, altered mental status, and evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434633" conceptname="Disorder of autonomic nervous system">autonomic instability</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4088122" conceptname="Heart irregular">irregular pulse</span> or blood pressure, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">diaphoresis</span>, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439142" conceptname="Myoglobinuria">myoglobinuria</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4230337" conceptname="Rhabdomyolysis">rhabdomyolysis</span>), and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span>. </p>
<p>The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (eg, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255848" conceptname="Pneumonia">pneumonia</span>, systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4181404" conceptname="Heat stroke">heat stroke</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">drug fever</span>, and primary central nervous system pathology.</p>
<p>The management of NMS should include: 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS. </p>
<p>If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.</p>

<p>A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> is unknown. </p>
<p>The risk of developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. </p>
<p>There is no known treatment for established cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and, thereby, may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.</p>
<p>Given these considerations, ABILIFY should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. </p>
<p>If signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> appear in a patient on ABILIFY, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with ABILIFY despite the presence of the syndrome.</p>

<p>Patients with an established diagnosis of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.

</p>
<p>Patients with clinically significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span> should be carefully monitored for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span> or other symptoms or signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur.

<p>As with other antipsychotic drugs, aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> or with conditions that lower the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> threshold, eg, Alzheimerâ€™s <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4182210" conceptname="Dementia">dementia</span>.

<p>ABILIFY, like other antipsychotics, may have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills. For example, in short-term, placebo-controlled trials, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> (including sedation) was reported as follows (aripiprazole incidence, placebo incidence): in adult patients (n=2467) treated with oral ABILIFY (11%, 6%), in pediatric patients ages 6 to 17 (n=611) (24%, 6%), and in adult patients (n=501) on ABILIFY Injection (9%, 6%). <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">Somnolence</span> (including sedation) led to discontinuation in 0.3% (8/2467) of adult patients and 3% (15/611) of pediatric patients (6 to 17 years) on oral ABILIFY in short-term, placebo-controlled trials, but did not lead to discontinuation of any adult patients on ABILIFY Injection.</p>
<p>Despite the relatively modest increased incidence of these events compared to placebo, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that therapy with ABILIFY does not affect them adversely.</p>

<p>Disruption of the bodyâ€™s ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing aripiprazole for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, (eg, exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435796" conceptname="Dehydration">dehydration</span>) <span class="Italics">[see ADVERSE REACTIONS <a href="#Section_6.3">(6.3)</a>]</span>.</p>

A total of 3390 patients were treated with oral aripiprazole for at least 180 days and 1933 patients treated with oral aripiprazole had at least 1 year of exposure.</p>
<p>Aripiprazole has been evaluated for safety in 920 patients (6 to 17 years) who participated in multiple-dose, clinical trials in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span>, bipolar <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">mania</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439780" conceptname="Autistic disorder">autistic disorder</span> and who had approximately 517 patient-years of exposure to oral aripiprazole. A total of 465 pediatric patients were treated with oral aripiprazole for at least 180 days and 117 pediatric patients treated with oral aripiprazole had at least 1 year of exposure.</p>
<p>The conditions and duration of treatment with aripiprazole (monotherapy and adjunctive therapy with antidepressants or mood stabilizers) included (in overlapping categories) double-blind, comparative and noncomparative open-label studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, fixed- and flexible-dose studies, and short- and longer-term exposure.</p>
<p>Adverse events during exposure were obtained by collecting volunteered adverse events, as well as results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analyses, and ECG. Adverse experiences were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. In the tables and tabulations that follow, MedDRA dictionary terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events into a smaller number of standardized event categories, in order to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events.</p>
<p>The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse event of the type listed. An event was considered treatment emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. There was no attempt to use investigator causality assessments; ie, all events meeting the defined criteria, regardless of investigator causality, are included. </p>
<p>Throughout this section, adverse reactions are reported. These are adverse events that were considered to be reasonably associated with the use of ABILIFY (adverse drug reactions) based on the comprehensive assessment of the available adverse event information. A causal association for ABILIFY often cannot be reliably established in individual cases.</p>
<p>The figures in the tables and tabulations cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatment, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescriber with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse reaction incidence in the population studied.</p>

<h1>DRUG INTERACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when ABILIFY is taken in combination with other centrally-acting drugs or alcohol.</p>
<p>Due to its alpha adrenergic antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Aripiprazole is not a substrate of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2E1 enzymes. Aripiprazole also does not undergo direct glucuronidation. This suggests that an interaction of aripiprazole with inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes, or other factors, like smoking, is unlikely.</p>
<p>Both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for aripiprazole metabolism. Agents that induce CYP3A4 (eg, carbamazepine) could cause an increase in aripiprazole clearance and lower blood levels. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole) or CYP2D6 (eg, quinidine, fluoxetine, or paroxetine) can inhibit aripiprazole elimination and cause increased blood levels. </p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Ketoconazole and Other CYP3A4 Inhibitors</span></p>
<p>Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg/day for 14 days) with a 15 mg single dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite by 63% and 77%, respectively. The effect of a higher ketoconazole dose (400 mg/day) has not been studied. When ketoconazole is given concomitantly with aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of its normal dose. Other strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (itraconazole) would be expected to have similar effects and need similar dose reductions; moderate inhibitors (erythromycin, grapefruit juice) have not been studied. When the CYP3A4 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should be increased.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Quinidine and Other CYP2D6 Inhibitors</span></p>
<p>Coadministration of a 10 mg single dose of aripiprazole with quinidine (166 mg/day for 13 days), a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, increased the AUC of aripiprazole by 112% but decreased the AUC of its active metabolite, dehydro-aripiprazole, by 35%. Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of its normal dose when quinidine is given concomitantly with aripiprazole. Other significant inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine or paroxetine, would be expected to have similar effects and should lead to similar dose reductions. When the CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should be increased. When adjunctive ABILIFY is administered to patients with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, ABILIFY should be administered without dosage adjustment as specified in <span class="Italics">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION <a href="#Section_2.3">(2.3)</a></span>.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Carbamazepine and Other CYP3A4 Inducers</span></p>
<p>Coadministration of carbamazepine (200 mg twice daily), a potent CYP3A4 inducer, with aripiprazole (30 mg/day) resulted in an approximate 70% decrease in Cmax and AUC values of both aripiprazole and its active metabolite, dehydro-aripiprazole. When carbamazepine is added to aripiprazole therapy, aripiprazole dose should be doubled. Additional dose increases should be based on clinical evaluation. When carbamazepine is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interactions</span> with drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. In <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> studies, 10 mg/day to 30 mg/day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on metabolism by CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan), CYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole, warfarin), and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan) substrates. Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>.</p>
<p>No effect of aripiprazole was seen on the pharmacokinetics of lithium or valproate.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Alcohol</span></p>
<p>There was no significant difference between aripiprazole coadministered with ethanol and placebo coadministered with ethanol on performance of gross motor skills or stimulus response in healthy subjects. As with most psychoactive medications, patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking ABILIFY.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Famotidine </span></p>
<p>Coadministration of aripiprazole (given in a single dose of 15 mg) with a 40 mg single dose of the H<span class="Sub">2</span> antagonist famotidine, a potent gastric acid blocker, decreased the solubility of aripiprazole and, hence, its rate of absorption, reducing by 37% and 21% the Cmax of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, respectively, and by 13% and 15%, respectively, the extent of absorption (AUC). No dosage adjustment of aripiprazole is required when administered concomitantly with famotidine.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>

<p><span class="Bold">Teratogenic Effects</span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Pregnancy Category C:</span> In animal studies, aripiprazole demonstrated developmental toxicity, including possible teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits.</p>
<p>Pregnant rats were treated with oral doses of 3 mg/kg/day, 10 mg/kg/day, and 30 mg/kg/day (1 times, 3 times, and 10 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) of aripiprazole during the period of organogenesis. Gestation was slightly prolonged at 30 mg/kg. Treatment caused a slight delay in fetal development, as evidenced by decreased fetal weight (30 mg/kg), undescended testes (30 mg/kg), and delayed skeletal ossification (10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg). There were no adverse effects on embryofetal or pup survival. Delivered offspring had decreased body weights (10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg), and increased incidences of hepatodiaphragmatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4101098" conceptname="Nodule">nodules</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201061" conceptname="Diaphragmatic hernia">diaphragmatic hernia</span> at 30 mg/kg (the other dose groups were not examined for these findings). A low incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201061" conceptname="Diaphragmatic hernia">diaphragmatic hernia</span> was also seen in the fetuses exposed to 30 mg/kg. Postnatally, delayed vaginal opening was seen at 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg and impaired reproductive performance (decreased fertility rate, corpora lutea, implants, live fetuses, and increased post-implantation loss, likely mediated through effects on female offspring) was seen at 30 mg/kg. Some maternal toxicity was seen at 30 mg/kg; however, there was no evidence to suggest that these developmental effects were secondary to maternal toxicity.</p>
<p>In pregnant rats receiving aripiprazole injection intravenously (3 mg/kg/day, 9 mg/kg/day, and 27 mg/kg/day) during the period of organogenesis, decreased fetal weight and delayed skeletal ossification were seen at the highest dose, which also caused some maternal toxicity. </p>
<p>Pregnant rabbits were treated with oral doses of 10 mg/kg/day, 30 mg/kg/day, and 100 mg/kg/day (2 times, 3 times, and 11 times human exposure at MRHD based on AUC and 6 times, 19 times, and 65 times the MRHD based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) of aripiprazole during the period of organogenesis. Decreased maternal food consumption and increased abortions were seen at 100 mg/kg. Treatment caused increased fetal mortality (100 mg/kg), decreased fetal weight (30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg), increased incidence of a skeletal abnormality (fused sternebrae at 30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg), and minor skeletal variations (100 mg/kg).</p>
<p>In pregnant rabbits receiving aripiprazole injection intravenously (3 mg/kg/day, 10 mg/kg/day, and 30 mg/kg/day) during the period of organogenesis, the highest dose, which caused pronounced maternal toxicity, resulted in decreased fetal weight, increased fetal abnormalities (primarily skeletal), and decreased fetal skeletal ossification. The fetal no-effect dose was 10 mg/kg, which produced 5 times the human exposure at the MRHD based on AUC and is 6 times the MRHD based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>. </p>
<p>In a study in which rats were treated with oral doses of 3 mg/kg/day, 10 mg/kg/day, and 30 mg/kg/day (1 times, 3 times, and 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) of aripiprazole perinatally and postnatally (from day 17 of gestation through day 21 postpartum), slight maternal toxicity and slightly prolonged gestation were seen at 30 mg/kg. An increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443213" conceptname="Stillbirth">stillbirths</span> and decreases in pup weight (persisting into adulthood) and survival were seen at this dose.</p>
<p>In rats receiving aripiprazole injection intravenously (3 mg/kg/day, 8 mg/kg/day, and 20 mg/kg/day) from day 6 of gestation through day 20 postpartum, an increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443213" conceptname="Stillbirth">stillbirths</span> was seen at 8 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, and decreases in early postnatal pup weights and survival were seen at 20 mg/kg. These doses produced some maternal toxicity. There were no effects on postnatal behavioral and reproductive development.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Non-teratogenic Effects</span></p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. It is not known whether aripiprazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208994" conceptname="Increased muscle tone">hypertonia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">hypotonia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4158346" conceptname="Respiratory distress">respiratory distress</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434750" conceptname="Feeding difficulties and mismanagement">feeding disorder</span> in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity; while in some cases symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization.</p>
<p>Aripiprazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>The mechanism of action of aripiprazole, as with other drugs having efficacy in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span>, bipolar disorder, major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span> associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439780" conceptname="Autistic disorder">autistic disorder</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span> associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> or bipolar disorder, is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the efficacy of aripiprazole is mediated through a combination of partial agonist activity at D<span class="Sub">2</span> and 5-HT<span class="Sub">1A</span> receptors and antagonist activity at 5-HT<span class="Sub">2A</span> receptors. Actions at receptors other than D<span class="Sub">2</span>, 5-HT<span class="Sub">1A</span>, and 5-HT<span class="Sub">2A</span> may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole (eg, the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span> observed with aripiprazole may be explained by its antagonist activity at adrenergic alpha<span class="Sub">1</span> receptors).</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Aripiprazole exhibits high affinity for dopamine D<span class="Sub">2</span> and D<span class="Sub">3</span>, serotonin 5-HT<span class="Sub">1A</span> and 5-HT<span class="Sub">2A</span> receptors (K<span class="Sub">i</span> values of 0.34 nM, 0.8 nM, 1.7 nM, and 3.4 nM, respectively), moderate affinity for dopamine D<span class="Sub">4</span>, serotonin 5-HT<span class="Sub">2C</span> and 5-HT<span class="Sub">7</span>, alpha<span class="Sub">1</span>-adrenergic and histamine H<span class="Sub">1</span> receptors (K<span class="Sub">i</span> values of 44 nM, 15 nM, 39 nM, 57 nM, and 61 nM, respectively), and moderate affinity for the serotonin reuptake site (K<span class="Sub">i</span>=98 nM). Aripiprazole has no appreciable affinity for cholinergic muscarinic receptors (IC<span class="Sub">50</span>&gt;1000 nM). Aripiprazole functions as a partial agonist at the dopamine D<span class="Sub">2</span> and the serotonin 5-HT<span class="Sub">1A</span> receptors, and as an antagonist at serotonin 5-HT<span class="Sub">2A</span> receptor.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>ABILIFY activity is presumably primarily due to the parent drug, aripiprazole, and to a lesser extent, to its major metabolite, dehydro-aripiprazole, which has been shown to have affinities for D<span class="Sub">2</span> receptors similar to the parent drug and represents 40% of the parent drug exposure in plasma. The mean elimination half-lives are about 75 hours and 94 hours for aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, respectively. Steady-state concentrations are attained within 14 days of dosing for both active moieties. Aripiprazole accumulation is predictable from single-dose pharmacokinetics. At steady-state, the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole are dose-proportional. Elimination of aripiprazole is mainly through hepatic metabolism involving two P450 isozymes, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.</p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic studies showed that ABILIFY DISCMELT Orally Disintegrating Tablets are bioequivalent to ABILIFY Tablets.</p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="Bold">ORAL ADMINISTRATION</span></p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Tablet:</span> Aripiprazole is well absorbed after administration of the tablet, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3 hours to 5 hours; the absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87%. ABILIFY can be administered with or without food. Administration of a 15 mg ABILIFY Tablet with a standard high-fat meal did not significantly affect the Cmax or AUC of aripiprazole or its active metabolite, dehydro-aripiprazole, but delayed Tmax by 3 hours for aripiprazole and 12 hours for dehydro-aripiprazole.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Oral Solution:</span> Aripiprazole is well absorbed when administered orally as the solution. At equivalent doses, the plasma concentrations of aripiprazole from the solution were higher than that from the tablet formulation. In a relative bioavailability study comparing the pharmacokinetics of 30 mg aripiprazole as the oral solution to 30 mg aripiprazole tablets in healthy subjects, the solution to tablet ratios of geometric mean Cmax and AUC values were 122% and 114%, respectively <span class="Italics">[see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION <a href="#Section_2.6">(2.6)</a>]</span>. The single-dose pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole were linear and dose-proportional between the doses of 5 mg to 30 mg.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p>
<p>The steady-state volume of distribution of aripiprazole following intravenous administration is high (404 L or 4.9 L/kg), indicating extensive extravascular distribution. At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and its major metabolite are greater than 99% bound to serum proteins, primarily to albumin. In healthy human volunteers administered 0.5 mg/day to 30 mg/day aripiprazole for 14 days, there was dose-dependent D<span class="Sub">2</span> receptor occupancy indicating brain penetration of aripiprazole in humans.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Metabolism and Elimination</span></p>
<p>Aripiprazole is metabolized primarily by three biotransformation pathways: dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant drug moiety in the systemic circulation. At steady-state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plasma. </p>
<p>Approximately 8% of Caucasians and 3â€“8% of Black/African Americans lack the capacity to metabolize CYP2D6 substrates and are classified as poor metabolizers (PM), whereas the rest are extensive metabolizers (EM). PMs have about an 80% increase in aripiprazole exposure and about a 30% decrease in exposure to the active metabolite compared to EMs, resulting in about a 60% higher exposure to the total active moieties from a given dose of aripiprazole compared to EMs. Coadministration of ABILIFY with known inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as quinidine or fluoxetine in EMs, approximately doubles aripiprazole plasma exposure, and dose adjustment is needed <span class="Italics">[see DRUG INTERACTIONS <a href="#Section_7.1">(7.1)</a>]</span>. Similarly, PMs have higher exposure to aripiprazole compared to EMs; hence, PMs should have their initial dose reduced by one-half. Laboratory tests are available to identify CYP2D6 PMs. The mean elimination half-lives are about 75 hours and 146 hours for aripiprazole in EMs and PMs, respectively. Aripiprazole does not inhibit or induce the CYP2D6 pathway.</p>
<p>Following a single oral dose of [<span class="Sup">14</span>C]-labeled aripiprazole, approximately 25% and 55% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Less than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18% of the oral dose was recovered unchanged in the feces.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Bold">INTRAMUSCULAR ADMINISTRATION</span></p>
<p>In two pharmacokinetic studies of aripiprazole injection administered intramuscularly to healthy subjects, the median times to the peak plasma concentrations were at 1 hour and 3 hours. A 5 mg intramuscular injection of aripiprazole had an absolute bioavailability of 100%. The geometric mean maximum concentration achieved after an intramuscular dose was on average 19% higher than the Cmax of the oral tablet. While the systemic exposure over 24 hours was generally similar between aripiprazole injection given intramuscularly and after oral tablet administration, the aripiprazole AUC in the first 2 hours after an intramuscular injection was 90% greater than the AUC after the same dose as a tablet. In stable patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4286201" conceptname="Schizoaffective disorder">schizoaffective disorder</span>, the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole after intramuscular administration were linear over a dose range of 1 mg to 45 mg. Although the metabolism of aripiprazole injection was not systematically evaluated, the intramuscular route of administration would not be expected to alter the metabolic pathways.</p>

<p class="First"></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span></p>
<p>Lifetime carcinogenicity studies were conducted in ICR mice and in Sprague-Dawley (SD) and F344 rats. Aripiprazole was administered for 2 years in the diet at doses of 1 mg/kg/day, 3 mg/kg/day, 10 mg/kg/day, and 30 mg/kg/day to ICR mice and 1 mg/kg/day, 3 mg/kg/day, and 10 mg/kg/day to F344 rats (0.2 times to 5 times and 0.3 times to 3 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, respectively). In addition, SD rats were dosed orally for 2 years at 10 mg/kg/day, 20 mg/kg/day, 40 mg/kg/day, and 60 mg/kg/day (3 times to 19 times the MRHD based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). Aripiprazole did not induce tumors in male mice or rats. In female mice, the incidences of pituitary gland <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> and mammary gland adenocarcinomas and adenoacanthomas were increased at dietary doses of 3 mg/kg/day to 30 mg/kg/day (0.1 times to 0.9 times human exposure at MRHD based on AUC and 0.5 times to 5 times the MRHD based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). In female rats, the incidence of mammary gland fibroadenomas was increased at a dietary dose of 10 mg/kg/day (0.1 times human exposure at MRHD based on AUC and 3 times the MRHD based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>); and the incidences of adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span>/carcinomas were increased at an oral dose of 60 mg/kg/day (14 times human exposure at MRHD based on AUC and 19 times the MRHD based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). </p>
<p>Proliferative changes in the pituitary and mammary gland of rodents have been observed following chronic administration of other antipsychotic agents and are considered prolactin-mediated. Serum prolactin was not measured in the aripiprazole carcinogenicity studies. However, increases in serum prolactin levels were observed in female mice in a 13-week dietary study at the doses associated with mammary gland and pituitary tumors. Serum prolactin was not increased in female rats in 4-week and 13-week dietary studies at the dose associated with mammary gland tumors. The relevance for human risk of the findings of prolactin-mediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unknown.</p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span></p>
<p>The mutagenic potential of aripiprazole was tested in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> bacterial reverse-mutation assay, the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> bacterial DNA repair assay, the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> forward gene mutation assay in mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> cells, the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung (CHL) cells, the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> micronucleus assay in mice, and the unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in rats. Aripiprazole and a metabolite (2,3-DCPP) were clastogenic in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> chromosomal aberration assay in CHL cells with and without metabolic activation. The metabolite, 2,3-DCPP, produced increases in numerical aberrations in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> assay in CHL cells in the absence of metabolic activation. A positive response was obtained in the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> micronucleus assay in mice; however, the response was due to a mechanism not considered relevant to humans.</p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span></p>
<p>Female rats were treated with oral doses of 2 mg/kg/day, 6 mg/kg/day, and 20 mg/kg/day (0.6 times, 2 times, and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) of aripiprazole from 2 weeks prior to mating through day 7 of gestation. Estrus cycle irregularities and increased corpora lutea were seen at all doses, but no impairment of fertility was seen. Increased pre-implantation loss was seen at 6 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg and decreased fetal weight was seen at 20 mg/kg.</p>
<p>Male rats were treated with oral doses of 20 mg/kg/day, 40 mg/kg/day, and 60 mg/kg/day (6 times, 13 times, and 19 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) of aripiprazole from 9 weeks prior to mating through mating.

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p>
<p>The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> was evaluated in five short-term (4-week and 6-week), placebo-controlled trials of acutely relapsed inpatients who predominantly met DSM-III/IV criteria for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span>. Four of the five trials were able to distinguish aripiprazole from placebo, but one study, the smallest, did not. Three of these studies also included an active control group consisting of either risperidone (one trial) or haloperidol (two trials), but they were not designed to allow for a comparison of ABILIFY and the active comparators.</p>
<p>In the four positive trials for ABILIFY, four primary measures were used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) is a multi-item inventory of general psychopathology used to evaluate the effects of drug treatment in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span>. The PANSS positive subscale is a subset of items in the PANSS that rates seven positive symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="444401" conceptname="Delusions">delusions</span>, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">excitement</span>, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4195585" conceptname="Hostile behavior">hostility</span>). The PANSS negative subscale is a subset of items in the PANSS that rates seven negative symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4264021" conceptname="Blunted affect">blunted affect</span>, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive apathetic withdrawal, difficulty in abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity/flow of conversation, stereotyped thinking). The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) assessment reflects the impression of a skilled observer, fully familiar with the manifestations of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span>, about the overall clinical state of the patient.</p>
<p>Â In a 4-week trial (n=414) comparing two fixed doses of ABILIFY (15 mg/day or 30 mg/day) to placebo, both doses of ABILIFY were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score, PANSS positive subscale, and CGI-severity score. In addition, the 15 mg dose was superior to placebo in the PANSS negative subscale. </p>
<p>Â In a 4-week trial (n=404) comparing two fixed doses of ABILIFY (20 mg/day or 30 mg/day) to placebo, both doses of ABILIFY were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score, PANSS positive subscale, PANSS negative subscale, and CGI-severity score.</p>
<p>Â In a 6-week trial (n=420) comparing three fixed doses of ABILIFY (10 mg/day, 15 mg/day, or 20 mg/day) to placebo, all three doses of ABILIFY were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score, PANSS positive subscale, and the PANSS negative subscale. </p>
<p>Â In a 6-week trial (n=367) comparing three fixed doses of ABILIFY (2 mg/day, 5 mg/day, or 10 mg/day) to placebo, the 10 mg dose of ABILIFY was superior to placebo in the PANSS total score, the primary outcome measure of the study. The 2 mg and 5 mg doses did not demonstrate superiority to placebo on the primary outcome measure.</p>
<p>Â In a fifth study, a 4-week trial (n=103) comparing ABILIFY in a range of 5 mg/day to 30 mg/day to placebo, ABILIFY was only significantly different compared to placebo in a responder analysis based on the CGI-severity score, a primary outcome for that trial.</p>
<p>Thus, the efficacy of 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg daily doses was established in two studies for each dose. Among these doses, there was no evidence that the higher dose groups offered any advantage over the lowest dose group of these studies.</p>
<p>An examination of population subgroups did not reveal any clear evidence of differential responsiveness on the basis of age, gender, or race.</p>
<p>A longer-term trial enrolled 310 inpatients or outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> who were, by history, symptomatically stable on other antipsychotic medications for periods of 3 months or longer. These patients were discontinued from their antipsychotic medications and randomized to ABILIFY 15 mg/day or placebo for up to 26 weeks of observation for relapse. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as CGI-Improvement score of â‰¥5 (minimally worse), scores â‰¥5 (moderately severe) on the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4195585" conceptname="Hostile behavior">hostility</span> or uncooperativeness items of the PANSS, or â‰¥20% increase in the PANSS total score. Patients receiving ABILIFY 15 mg/day experienced a significantly longer time to relapse over the subsequent 26 weeks compared to those receiving placebo.</p>

<p>The efficacy of ABILIFY (aripiprazole) in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> in pediatric patients (13 to 17 years of age) was evaluated in one 6-week, placebo-controlled trial of outpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> and had a PANSS score â‰¥70 at baseline. In this trial (n=302) comparing two fixed doses of ABILIFY (10 mg/day or 30 mg/day) to placebo, ABILIFY was titrated starting from 2 mg/day to the target dose in 5 days in the 10 mg/day treatment arm and in 11 days in the 30 mg/day treatment arm.  Both doses of ABILIFY were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score, the primary outcome measure of the study. The 30 mg/day dosage was not shown to be more efficacious than the 10 mg/day dose. Although maintenance efficacy in pediatric patients has not been systematically evaluated, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of aripiprazole pharmacokinetic parameters in adult and pediatric patients.</p>

<p>The efficacy of ABILIFY as monotherapy in the acute treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic episodes</span> was established in four 3-week, placebo-controlled trials in hospitalized patients who met the DSM-IV criteria for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432876" conceptname="Bipolar I disorder">bipolar I disorder</span> with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span> or mixed episodes. These studies included patients with or without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychotic</span> features and two of the studies also included patients with or without a rapid-cycling course.</p>
<p>The primary instrument used for assessing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span> symptoms was the Young <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">Mania</span> Rating Scale (Y-MRS), an 11-item clinician-rated scale traditionally used to assess the degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span> symptomatology (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, disruptive/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021344" conceptname="Abusive behavior">aggressive behavior</span>, sleep, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4304866" conceptname="Elevated mood">elevated mood</span>, speech, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">increased activity</span>, sexual interest, language/thought disorder, thought content, appearance, and insight) in a range from 0 (no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span> features) to 60 (maximum score). A key secondary instrument included the Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar (CGI-BP) Scale.</p>
<p>In the four positive, 3-week, placebo-controlled trials (n=268; n=248; n=480; n=485) which evaluated ABILIFY in a range of 15 mg to 30 mg, once daily (with a starting dose of 15 mg/day in two studies and 30 mg/day in two studies), ABILIFY was superior to placebo in the reduction of Y-MRS total score and CGI-BP Severity of Illness score (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">mania</span>). In the two studies with a starting dose of 15 mg/day, 48% and 44% of patients were on 15 mg/day at endpoint.

<p><span class="Bold">Adjunctive Therapy</span></p>
<p>The efficacy of adjunctive ABILIFY with concomitant lithium or valproate in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span> or mixed episodes was established in a 6-week, placebo-controlled study (n=384) with a 2-week lead-in mood stabilizer monotherapy phase in adult patients who met DSM-IV criteria for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432876" conceptname="Bipolar I disorder">bipolar I disorder</span>.

<p>Patients were initiated on open-label lithium (0.6 mEq/L to 1.0 mEq/L) or valproate (50 Î¼g/mL to 125 Î¼g/mL) at therapeutic serum levels, and remained on stable doses for 2 weeks. At the end of 2 weeks, patients demonstrating inadequate response (Y-MRS total score â‰¥16 and â‰¤25% improvement on the Y-MRS total score) to lithium or valproate were randomized to receive either aripiprazole (15 mg/day or an increase to 30 mg/day as early as day 7) or placebo as adjunctive therapy with open-label lithium or valproate. In the 6-week, placebo-controlled phase, adjunctive ABILIFY starting at 15 mg/day with concomitant lithium or valproate (in a therapeutic range of 0.6 mEq/L to 1.0 mEq/L or 50 Î¼g/mL to 125 Î¼g/mL, respectively) was superior to lithium or valproate with adjunctive placebo in the reduction of the Y-MRS total score and CGI-BP Severity of Illness score (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">mania</span>). Seventy-one percent of the patients coadministered valproate and 62% of the patients coadministered lithium were on 15 mg/day at 6-week endpoint.</p>

This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial compared two fixed doses of ABILIFY (10 mg/day or 30 mg/day) to placebo. The ABILIFY dose was started at 2 mg/day, which was titrated to 5 mg/day after 2 days, and to the target dose in 5 days in the 10 mg/day treatment arm, and in 13 days in the 30 mg/day treatment arm. Both doses of ABILIFY were superior to placebo in change from baseline to week 4 on the Y-MRS total score.</p>

The first phase of this trial was an open-label stabilization period in which inpatients and outpatients were clinically stabilized and then maintained on open-label ABILIFY (15 mg/day or 30 mg/day, with a starting dose of 30 mg/day) for at least 6 consecutive weeks. One hundred sixty-one outpatients were then randomized in a double-blind fashion, to either the same dose of ABILIFY they were on at the end of the stabilization and maintenance period or placebo and were then monitored for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span> or depressive relapse. During the randomization phase, ABILIFY was superior to placebo on time to the number of combined affective relapses (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span> plus depressive), the primary outcome measure for this study. A total of 55 mood events were observed during the double-blind treatment phase. Nineteen were from the ABILIFY group and 36 were from the placebo group. The number of observed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic episodes</span> in the ABILIFY group (6) were fewer than that in the placebo group (19), while the number of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive episodes</span> in the ABILIFY group (9) was similar to that in the placebo group (11).</p>

Patients were initiated on open-label lithium (0.6 mEq/L to 1.0 mEq/L) or valproate (50 Î¼g/mL to 125 Î¼g/mL) at therapeutic serum levels, and remained on stable doses for 2 weeks. At the end of 2 weeks, patients demonstrating inadequate response (Y-MRS total score â‰¥16 and â‰¤35% improvement on the Y-MRS total score) to lithium or valproate received aripiprazole with a starting dose of 15 mg/day with the option to increase to 30 mg or reduce to 10 mg as early as day 4, as adjunctive therapy with open-label lithium or valproate. Prior to randomization, patients on the combination of single-blind aripiprazole and lithium or valproate were required to maintain stability (Y-MRS and MADRS total scores â‰¤12) for 12 consecutive weeks. Three hundred thirty-seven patients were then randomized in a double-blind fashion, to either the same dose of ABILIFY they were on at the end of the stabilization period or placebo plus lithium or valproate and were then monitored for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span>, mixed, or depressive relapse for a maximum of 52 weeks. ABILIFY was superior to placebo on the primary endpoint, time from randomization to relapse to any mood event. A mood event was defined as hospitalization for a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span>, mixed, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive episode</span>, study discontinuation due to lack of efficacy accompanied by Y-MRS score &gt;16 and/or a MADRS &gt;16, or an SAE of worsening disease accompanied by Y-MRS score &gt;16 and/or a MADRS &gt;16. A total of 68 mood events were observed during the double-blind treatment phase. Twenty-five were from the ABILIFY group and 43 were from the placebo group. The number of observed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic episodes</span> in the ABILIFY group (7) were fewer than that in the placebo group (19), while the number of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive episodes</span> in the ABILIFY group (14) was similar to that in the placebo group (18).

<p><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p>
<p>The efficacy of ABILIFY (aripiprazole) in the adjunctive treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD) was demonstrated in two short-term (6-week), placebo-controlled trials of adult patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for MDD who had had an inadequate response to prior antidepressant therapy (1 to 3 courses) in the current episode and who had also demonstrated an inadequate response to 8 weeks of prospective antidepressant therapy (paroxetine controlled-release, venlafaxine extended-release, fluoxetine, escitalopram, or sertraline). Inadequate response for prospective treatment was defined as less than 50% improvement on the 17-item version of the Hamilton <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> Rating Scale (HAMD17), minimal HAMD17 score of 14, and a Clinical Global Impressions Improvement rating of no better than minimal improvement. Inadequate response to prior treatment was defined as less than 50% improvement as perceived by the patient after a minimum of 6 weeks of antidepressant therapy at or above the minimal effective dose.</p>
<p>The primary instrument used for assessing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4191716" conceptname="Symptoms of depression">depressive symptoms</span> was the Montgomery-Asberg <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> Rating Scale (MADRS), a 10-item clinician-rated scale used to assess the degree of depressive symptomatology (apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4200706" conceptname="Tension">tension</span>, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">lassitude</span>, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts). The key secondary instrument was the Sheehan <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052648" conceptname="Disability">Disability</span> Scale (SDS), a 3-item self-rated instrument used to assess the impact of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> on three domains of functioning (work/school, social life, and family life) with each item scored from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extreme).</p>
<p>In the two trials (n=381, n=362), ABILIFY was superior to placebo in reducing mean MADRS total scores. In one study, ABILIFY was also superior to placebo in reducing the mean SDS score.</p>
<p>In both trials, patients received ABILIFY adjunctive to antidepressants at a dose of 5 mg/day. Based on tolerability and efficacy, doses could be adjusted by 5 mg increments, one week apart. Allowable doses were: 2 mg/day, 5 mg/day, 10 mg/day, 15 mg/day, and for patients who were not on potent CYP2D6 inhibitors fluoxetine and paroxetine, 20 mg/day. The mean final dose at the end point for the two trials was 10.7 mg/day and 11.4 mg/day.</p>
<p>An examination of population subgroups did not reveal evidence of differential response based on age, choice of prospective antidepressant, or race. With regard to gender, a smaller mean reduction on the MADRS total score was seen in males than in females.</p>

<p>The efficacy of ABILIFY (aripiprazole) in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span> associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439780" conceptname="Autistic disorder">autistic disorder</span> was established in two 8-week, placebo-controlled trials in pediatric patients (6 to 17 years of age) who met the DSM-IV criteria for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439780" conceptname="Autistic disorder">autistic disorder</span> and demonstrated behaviors such as tantrums, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021344" conceptname="Abusive behavior">aggression</span>, self-injurious behavior, or a combination of these problems. Over 75% of these subjects were under 13 years of age.</p>
<p>Efficacy was evaluated using two assessment scales: the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale. The primary outcome measure in both trials was the change from baseline to endpoint in the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">Irritability</span> subscale of the ABC (ABC-I). The ABC-I subscale measured the emotional and behavioral symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span> in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439780" conceptname="Autistic disorder">autistic disorder</span>, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021344" conceptname="Abusive behavior">aggression</span> towards others, deliberate self-injuriousness, temper tantrums, and quickly changing moods.</p>
<p>The results of these trials are as follows:</p>
<p> In one of the 8-week, placebo-controlled trials, children and adolescents with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439780" conceptname="Autistic disorder">autistic disorder</span> (n=98), aged 6 to 17 years, received daily doses of placebo or ABILIFY 2 mg/day to 15 mg/day. ABILIFY, starting at 2 mg/day with increases allowed up to 15 mg/day based on clinical response, significantly improved scores on the ABC-I subscale and on the CGI-I scale compared with placebo. The mean daily dose of ABILIFY at the end of 8-week treatment was 8.6 mg/day.</p>
<p> In the other 8-week, placebo-controlled trial in children and adolescents with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439780" conceptname="Autistic disorder">autistic disorder</span> (n=218), aged 6 to 17 years, three fixed doses of ABILIFY (5 mg/day, 10 mg/day, or 15 mg/day) were compared to placebo. ABILIFY dosing started at 2 mg/day and was increased to 5 mg/day after one week. After a second week, it was increased to 10 mg/day for patients in the 10 mg and 15 mg dose arms, and after a third week, it was increased to 15 mg/day in the 15 mg/day treatment arm. All three doses of ABILIFY significantly improved scores on the ABC-I subscale compared with placebo.</p>

<p>The efficacy of intramuscular aripiprazole for injection for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span> was established in three short-term (24-hour), placebo-controlled trials in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitated</span> inpatients from two diagnostic groups: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432876" conceptname="Bipolar I disorder">bipolar I disorder</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span> or mixed episodes, with or without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychotic</span> features). Each of the trials included a single active comparator treatment arm of either haloperidol injection (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> studies) or lorazepam injection (bipolar <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">mania</span> study). Patients could receive up to three injections during the 24-hour treatment periods; however, patients could not receive the second injection until after the initial 2-hour period when the primary efficacy measure was assessed. Patients enrolled in the trials needed to be: (1) judged by the clinical investigators as clinically <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitated</span> and clinically appropriate candidates for treatment with intramuscular medication, and (2) exhibiting a level of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span> that met or exceeded a threshold score of â‰¥15 on the five items comprising the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Excited Component (ie, poor impulse control, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4200706" conceptname="Tension">tension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4195585" conceptname="Hostile behavior">hostility</span>, uncooperativeness, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">excitement</span> items) with at least two individual item scores â‰¥4 using a 1-7 scoring system (1 = absent, 4 = moderate, 7 = extreme). In the studies, the mean baseline PANSS Excited Component score was 19, with scores ranging from 15 to 34 (out of a maximum score of 35), thus suggesting predominantly moderate levels of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span> with some patients experiencing mild or severe levels of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>. The primary efficacy measure used for assessing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span> signs and symptoms in these trials was the change from baseline in the PANSS Excited Component at 2 hours post-injection. A key secondary measure was the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) Scale. The results of the trials follow:</p>
<p>Â In a placebo-controlled trial in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitated</span> inpatients predominantly meeting DSM-IV criteria for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> (n=350), four fixed aripiprazole injection doses of 1 mg, 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg, and 15 mg were evaluated. At 2 hours post-injection, the 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg, and 15 mg doses were statistically superior to placebo in the PANSS Excited Component and on the CGI-I Scale.</p>
<p>Â In a second placebo-controlled trial in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitated</span> inpatients predominantly meeting DSM-IV criteria for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> (n=445), one fixed aripiprazole injection dose of 9.75 mg was evaluated. At 2 hours post-injection, aripiprazole for injection was statistically superior to placebo in the PANSS Excited Component and on the CGI-I Scale.</p>
<p>Â In a placebo-controlled trial in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitated</span> inpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432876" conceptname="Bipolar I disorder">bipolar I disorder</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span> or mixed) (n=291), two fixed aripiprazole injection doses of 9.75 mg and 15 mg were evaluated. At 2 hours post-injection, both doses were statistically superior to placebo in the PANSS Excited Component.</p>
<p>Examination of population subsets (age, race, and gender) did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of these subgroupings.</p>

<p>Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021498" conceptname="Panic attack">panic attacks</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4195585" conceptname="Hostile behavior">hostility</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021344" conceptname="Abusive behavior">aggressiveness</span>, impulsivity, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4108925" conceptname="Akathisia">akathisia</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">psychomotor restlessness</span>), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333678" conceptname="Hypomania">hypomania</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">mania</span>, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4092095" conceptname="Planning suicide">suicidal ideation</span>, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patientâ€™s prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patientâ€™s presenting symptoms.

<p>Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with ABILIFY and should counsel them in its appropriate use.

The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have.

Do not push the tablet through the foil because this could damage the tablet.
