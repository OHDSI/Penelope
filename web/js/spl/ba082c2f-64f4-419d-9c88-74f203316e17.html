<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Lidocaine HCl stabilizes the neuronal membrane by                                    inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and                                    conduction of impulses thereby effecting local anesthetic                                    action.</p>

<h2>Hemodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac                                    output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial                                    pressure.  With central neural blockade these changes                                    may be attributable to block of autonomic fibers, a direct                                    depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various                                    components of the cardiovascular system, and/or the                                    beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when                                    present.  The net effect is normally a modest                                    <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> when the recommended dosages are not                                    exceeded.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</h2>
<p class="First">Information derived from diverse formulations,                                    concentrations and usages reveals that lidocaine HCl is                                    completely absorbed following parenteral administration, its                                    rate of absorption depending, for example, upon various factors                                    such as the site of administration and the presence or absence                                    of a vasoconstrictor agent.  Except for intravascular                                    administration, the highest blood levels are obtained following                                    intercostal nerve block and the lowest after subcutaneous                                    administration. </p>
<p>The plasma binding of lidocaine HCl is dependent on drug                                    concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing                                    concentration.  At concentrations of 1 to 4 mcg of free                                    base per mL 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine HCl is protein                                    bound.  Binding is also dependent on the plasma                                    concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. </p>
<p>Lidocaine HCl crosses the blood-brain and placental                                    barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. </p>
<p>Lidocaine HCl is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and                                    metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the                                    kidneys.  Biotransformation includes oxidative                                    N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide                                    linkage, and conjugation.  N-dealkylation, a major                                    pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites                                    monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide.  The                                    pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are                                    similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine                                    HCl.  Approximately 90% of lidocaine HCl                                    administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and                                    less than 10% is excreted unchanged.  The                                    primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of                                    4-hydroxy-2,6-dimethylaniline. </p>
<p>The elimination half-life of lidocaine HCl following an                                    intravenous bolus injection is typically 1.5 to 2                                    hours.  Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine                                    HCl is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function                                    may alter lidocaine HCl kinetics.  The half-life may be                                    prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver                                    dysfunction.  Renal dysfunction does not affect                                    lidocaine HCl kinetics but may increase the accumulation of                                    metabolites.</p>
<p>Factors such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidosis</span> and the use of CNS stimulants                                    and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine HCl required                                    to produce overt systemic effects.  Objective adverse                                    manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing                                    venous plasma levels above 6 mcg free base per mL.  In                                    the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18 to 21 mcg/mL have                                    been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First">XYLOCAINE INJECTIONS FOR INFILTRATION AND NERVE BLOCK SHOULD BE EMPLOYED ONLY BY CLINICIANS WHO ARE WELL VERSED IN DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF DOSE-RELATED TOXICITY AND OTHER ACUTE EMERGENCIES THAT MIGHT ARISE FROM THE BLOCK TO BE EMPLOYED AND THEN ONLY AFTER ENSURING THE <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">IMMEDIATE</span></span> AVAILABILITY OF OXYGEN, OTHER RESUSCITATIVE DRUGS, CARDIOPULMONARY EQUIPMENT AND THE PERSONNEL NEEDED FOR PROPER MANAGEMENT OF TOXIC REACTIONS AND RELATED EMERGENCIES (see also <span class="Bold"><a href="#f38cf058-92bf-4b28-a704-59334a3c8cc1">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#dee2ae0a-5f79-432b-b723-5b3c3e3ed2ec">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>).  DELAY IN PROPER MANAGEMENT OF DOSE-RELATED TOXICITY, UNDERVENTILATION FROM ANY CAUSE AND/OR ALTERED SENSITIVITY MAY LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">ACIDOSIS</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">CARDIAC ARREST</span> AND, POSSIBLY, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">DEATH</span>.</p>
<p>Intra-articular infusions of local anesthetics following arthroscopic and other surgical procedures is an unapproved use, and there have been post-marketing reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span> in patients receiving such infusions.  The majority of reported cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span> have involved the shoulder joint; cases of gleno-humeral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span> have been described in pediatric and adult patients following intra-articular infusions of local anesthetics with and without epinephrine for periods of 48 to 72 hours.  There is insufficient information to determine whether shorter infusion periods are not associated with these findings.  The time of onset of symptoms, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77074" conceptname="Joint pain">joint pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4060220" conceptname="Stiff neck">stiffness</span> and loss of motion can be variable, but may begin as early as the 2nd month after surgery.  Currently, there is no effective treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span>; patients who experienced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span> have required additional diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and some required arthroplasty or shoulder replacement. </p>
<p>To avoid intravascular injection, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span> should be performed before the local anesthetic solution is injected.  The needle must be repositioned until no return of blood can be elicited by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span>.  Note, however, that the absence of blood in the syringe does not guarantee that intravascular injection has been avoided.</p>
<p>Local anesthetic solutions containing antimicrobial preservatives (eg, methylparaben) should not be used for epidural or spinal anesthesia because the safety of these agents has not been established with regard to intrathecal injection, either intentional or accidental.</p>
<p>Xylocaine with epinephrine solutions contain sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatic</span> episodes in certain susceptible people.  The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low.  Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatic</span> than in non-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatic</span> people.<br><br><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">Anaphylactic reactions</span> may occur following administration of lidocaine hydrochloride (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#f38cf058-92bf-4b28-a704-59334a3c8cc1">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span>).<br><br>In the case of severe reaction, discontinue the use of the drug.</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of lidocaine HCl depend on proper dosage, correct technique, adequate precautions, and readiness for emergencies.  Standard textbooks should be consulted for specific techniques and precautions for various regional anesthetic procedures. </p>
<p>Resuscitative equipment, oxygen, and other resuscitative drugs should be available for immediate use (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#aa184fbe-007a-49af-92f0-7028d0fa839c">WARNINGS</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#f38cf058-92bf-4b28-a704-59334a3c8cc1">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span>).  The lowest dosage that results in effective anesthesia should be used to avoid high plasma levels and serious adverse effects.  Syringe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspirations</span> should also be performed before and during each supplemental injection when using indwelling catheter techniques.  During the administration of epidural anesthesia, it is recommended that a test dose be administered initially and that the patient be monitored for central nervous system toxicity and cardiovascular toxicity, as well as for signs of unintended intrathecal administration, before proceeding.  When clinical conditions permit, consideration should be given to employing local anesthetic solutions that contain epinephrine for the test dose because circulatory changes compatible with epinephrine may also serve as a warning sign of unintended intravascular injection.  An intravascular injection is still possible even if <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspirations</span> for blood are negative.  Repeated doses of lidocaine HCl may cause significant increases in blood levels with each repeated dose because of slow accumulation of the drug or its metabolites.  Tolerance to elevated blood levels varies with the status of the patient.  Debilitated, elderly patients, acutely ill patients, and children should be given reduced doses commensurate with their age and physical condition.  Lidocaine HCl should also be used with caution in patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316135" conceptname="Atrioventricular block">heart block</span>.</p>
<p>Lumbar and caudal epidural anesthesia should be used with extreme caution in persons with the following conditions: existing neurological disease, spinal deformities, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="132797" conceptname="Sepsis">septicemia</span>, and severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>.</p>
<p>Local anesthetic solutions containing a vasoconstrictor should be used cautiously and in carefully circumscribed quantities in areas of the body supplied by end arteries or having otherwise compromised blood supply.  Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321052" conceptname="Peripheral vascular disease">peripheral vascular disease</span> and those with hypertensive vascular disease may exhibit exaggerated vasoconstrictor response.  Ischemic injury or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280654" conceptname="Necrosis">necrosis</span> may result.  Preparations containing a vasoconstrictor should be used with caution in patients during or following the administration of potent general anesthetic agents, since <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmias</span> may occur under such conditions.</p>
<p>Careful and constant monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory (adequacy of ventilation) vital signs and the patient’s state of consciousness should be accomplished after each local anesthetic injection.  It should be kept in mind at such times that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">restlessness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377575" conceptname="Tinnitus">tinnitus</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079185" conceptname="Hazy vision">blurred vision</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremors</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> may be early warning signs of central nervous system toxicity.   </p>
<p>Since amide-type local anesthetics are metabolized by the liver, Xylocaine Injection should be used with caution in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span>.  Patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span>, because of their inability to metabolize local anesthetics normally, are at greater risk of developing toxic plasma concentrations.  Xylocaine Injection should also be used with caution in patients with impaired cardiovascular function since they may be less able to compensate for functional changes associated with the prolongation of A-V conduction produced by these drugs.     </p>
<p>Many drugs used during the conduct of anesthesia are considered potential triggering agents for familial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440285" conceptname="Malignant hyperthermia">malignant hyperthermia</span>.  Since it is not known whether amide-type local anesthetics may trigger this reaction and since the need for supplemental general anesthesia cannot be predicted in advance, it is suggested that a standard protocol for the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440285" conceptname="Malignant hyperthermia">malignant hyperthermia</span> should be available.  Early unexplained signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317376" conceptname="Tachypnea">tachypnea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4354255" conceptname="Labile blood pressure">labile blood pressure</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span> may precede temperature elevation.  Successful outcome is dependent on early diagnosis, prompt discontinuance of the suspect triggering agent(s) and institution of treatment, including oxygen therapy, indicated supportive measures and dantrolene (consult dantrolene sodium intravenous package insert before using). </p>
<p>Proper tourniquet technique, as described in publications and standard textbooks, is essential in the performance of intravenous regional anesthesia.  Solutions containing epinephrine or other vasoconstrictors should not be used for this technique.</p>

<h2>Labor and Delivery</h2>
<p class="First">Local anesthetics rapidly cross the placenta and when                                    used for epidural, paracervical, pudendal or caudal block                                    anesthesia, can cause varying degrees of maternal, fetal and                                    neonatal toxicity (see <a href="#f334ba63-b169-4010-8ddf-11dfcb73f686">CLINICAL                                        PHARMACOLOGY</a><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><span class="Italics"><a href="#f334ba63-b169-4010-8ddf-11dfcb73f686">, Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</a></span></span></span>).  The potential for toxicity depends upon                                    the procedure performed, the type and amount of drug used, and                                    the technique of drug administration.  Adverse                                    reactions in the parturient, fetus and neonate involve                                    alterations of the central nervous system, peripheral vascular                                    tone and cardiac function. </p>
<p>Maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> has resulted from regional                                    anesthesia.  Local anesthetics produce vasodilation by                                    blocking sympathetic nerves.  Elevating the                                    patient’s legs and positioning her on her left side                                    will help prevent decreases in blood pressure. </p>
<p>The fetal heart rate also should be monitored                                    continuously, and electronic fetal monitoring is highly                                    advisable.</p>
<p>Epidural, spinal, paracervical, or pudendal anesthesia                                    may alter the forces of parturition through changes in uterine                                    contractility or maternal expulsive efforts.  In one                                    study, paracervical block anesthesia was associated with a                                    decrease in the mean duration of first stage labor and                                    facilitation of cervical dilation.  However, spinal and                                    epidural anesthesia have also been reported to prolong the                                    second stage of labor by removing the parturient’s                                    reflex urge to bear down or by interfering with motor                                    function.  The use of obstetrical anesthesia may                                    increase the need for forceps assistance.</p>
<p>The use of some local anesthetic drug products during                                    labor and delivery may be followed by diminished muscle strength                                    and tone for the first day or two of life.  The                                    long-term significance of these observations is                                    unknown.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314749" conceptname="Fetal bradycardia">Fetal bradycardia</span> may occur in 20 to 30                                    percent of patients receiving paracervical nerve block                                    anesthesia with the amide-type local anesthetics and may be                                    associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4344632" conceptname="Fetal acidosis">fetal acidosis</span>.  Fetal heart rate                                    should always be monitored during paracervical                                    anesthesia.  The physician should weigh the possible                                    advantages against risks when considering a paracervical block                                    in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439128" conceptname="Extreme immaturity">prematurity</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439393" conceptname="Pre-eclampsia">toxemia of pregnancy</span>, and fetal                                    distress.  Careful adherence to recommended dosage is                                    of the utmost importance in obstetrical paracervical                                    block.  Failure to achieve adequate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> with                                    recommended doses should arouse suspicion of intravascular or                                    fetal intracranial injection.  Cases compatible with                                    unintended fetal intracranial injection of local anesthetic                                    solution have been reported following intended paracervical or                                    pudendal block or both.  Babies so affected present                                    with unexplained neonatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> at birth, which correlates                                    with high local anesthetic serum levels, and often manifest                                    <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> within six hours.  Prompt use of supportive                                    measures combined with forced urinary excretion of the local                                    anesthetic has been used successfully to manage this                                    complication.</p>

<h2>Neurologic</h2>
<p class="First">The incidences of adverse reactions associated with the use of local anesthetics may be related to the total dose of local anesthetic administered and are also dependent upon the particular drug used, the route of administration and the physical status of the patient.  In a prospective review of 10,440 patients who received lidocaine HCl for spinal anesthesia, the incidences of adverse reactions were reported to be about 3 percent each for positional <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headaches</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134736" conceptname="Backache">backache</span>; 2 percent for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4190045" conceptname="Rigor">shivering</span>; and less than 1 percent each for peripheral nerve symptoms, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, respiratory inadequacy and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373474" conceptname="Diplopia">double vision</span>.  Many of these observations may be related to local anesthetic techniques, with or without a contribution from the local anesthetic. </p>
<p>In the practice of caudal or lumbar epidural block, occasional unintentional penetration of the subarachnoid space by the catheter may occur.  Subsequent adverse effects may depend partially on the amount of drug administered subdurally.  These may include spinal block of varying magnitude (including total spinal block), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> secondary to spinal block, loss of bladder and bowel control, and loss of perineal sensation and sexual function.  Persistent motor, sensory and/or autonomic (sphincter control) deficit of some lower spinal segments with slow recovery (several months) or incomplete recovery have been reported in rare instances when caudal or lumbar epidural block has been attempted.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134736" conceptname="Backache">Backache</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> have also been noted following use of these anesthetic procedures. </p>

<h2>Management of Local Anesthetic Emergencies</h2>
<p class="First">The first consideration is prevention, best accomplished                                    by careful and constant monitoring of cardiovascular and                                    respiratory vital signs and the patient’s state of                                    consciousness after each local anesthetic injection.                                     At the first sign of change, oxygen should be                                    administered.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Table 1 (Recommended Dosages) summarizes the recommended volumes and concentrations of Xylocaine Injection for various types of anesthetic procedures.  The dosages suggested in this table are for normal healthy adults and refer to the use of epinephrine-free solutions.  When larger volumes are required, only solutions containing epinephrine should be used except in those cases where vasopressor drugs may be contraindicated.</p>
<p>There have been adverse event reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span> in patients receiving intra-articular infusions of local anesthetics following arthroscopic and other surgical procedures.  Xylocaine is not approved for this use (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#aa184fbe-007a-49af-92f0-7028d0fa839c">WARNINGS</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#c73d1650-a10b-4fb4-82ef-e510975e8225">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>
<p>These recommended doses serve only as a guide to the amount of anesthetic required for most routine procedures.  The actual volumes and concentrations to be used depend on a number of factors such as type and extent of surgical procedure, depth of anesthesia and degree of muscular relaxation required, duration of anesthesia required, and the physical condition of the patient.  In all cases the lowest concentration and smallest dose that will produce the desired result should be given.  Dosages should be reduced for children and for the elderly and debilitated patients and patients with cardiac and/or liver disease.</p>
<p>The onset of anesthesia, the duration of anesthesia and the degree of muscular relaxation are proportional to the volume and concentration (ie, total dose) of local anesthetic used.  Thus, an increase in volume and concentration of Xylocaine Injection will decrease the onset of anesthesia, prolong the duration of anesthesia, provide a greater degree of muscular relaxation and increase the segmental spread of anesthesia.  However, increasing the volume and concentration of Xylocaine Injection may result in a more profound <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314171" conceptname="Low blood pressure reading">fall in blood pressure</span> when used in epidural anesthesia.  Although the incidence of side effects with lidocaine HCl is quite low, caution should be exercised when employing large volumes and concentrations, since the incidence of side effects is directly proportional to the total dose of local anesthetic agent injected.</p>
<p>For intravenous regional anesthesia, only the 50 mL single dose vial containing Xylocaine (lidocaine HCl) 0.5% Injection should be used.</p>

<h2>Epidural Anesthesia</h2>
<p class="First">For epidural anesthesia, only the following dosage forms Xylocaine Injection are recommended:</p>
<p>1% without epinephrine                         10 mL Plastic Ampule</p>
<p>1% without epinephrine                         30 mL single dose solutions</p>
<p>1% with epinephrine   1:200,000           30 mL single dose solutions</p>
<p>1.5% without epinephrine                      10 mL Plastic Ampule</p>
<p>1.5% without epinephrine                      20 mL Plastic Ampule</p>
<p>1.5% with epinephrine  1:200,000          30 mL ampules, 30 mL single dose solutions</p>
<p>2% without epinephrine                         10 mL Plastic Ampule</p>
<p>2% with epinephrine   1:200,000           20 mL ampules, 20 mL single dose solutions</p>
<br><p>Although these solutions are intended specifically for epidural anesthesia, they may also be used for infiltration and peripheral nerve block, provided they are employed as single dose units.  These solutions contain no bacteriostatic agent. </p>
<p>In epidural anesthesia, the dosage varies with the number of dermatomes to be anesthetized (generally 2 to 3 mL of the indicated concentration per dermatome).</p>

<h2>Caudal and Lumbar Epidural Block</h2>
<p class="First">As a precaution against the adverse experience sometimes                                    observed following unintentional penetration of the subarachnoid                                    space, a test dose such as 2 to 3 mL of 1.5% lidocaine                                    HCl should be administered at least 5 minutes prior to injecting                                    the total volume required for a lumbar or caudal epidural                                    block.  The test dose should be repeated if the patient                                    is moved in a manner that may have displaced the                                    catheter.  Epinephrine, if contained in the test dose                                    (10 to 15 mcg have been suggested), may serve as a warning of                                    unintentional intravascular injection.  If injected                                    into a blood vessel, this amount of epinephrine is likely to                                    produce a transient “epinephrine response?                                    within 45 seconds, consisting of an increase in heart rate and                                    systolic blood pressure, circumoral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260836" conceptname="Blanching of skin">pallor</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315078" conceptname="Palpitations">palpitations</span> and                                    <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436817" conceptname="Feeling nervous">nervousness</span> in the unsedated patient.  The sedated                                    patient may exhibit only a pulse rate increase of 20 or more                                    beats per minute for 15 or more seconds.  Patients on                                    beta blockers may not manifest changes in heart rate, but blood                                    pressure monitoring can detect an evanescent rise in systolic                                    blood pressure.  Adequate time should be allowed for                                    onset of anesthesia after administration of each test                                    dose.  The rapid injection of a large volume of                                    Xylocaine Injection through the catheter should be avoided, and,                                    when feasible, fractional doses should be                                    administered.</p>
<p>In the event of the known injection of a large volume of                                    local anesthetic solution into the subarachnoid space, after                                    suitable resuscitation and if the catheter is in place, consider                                    attempting the recovery of drug by draining a moderate amount of                                    cerebrospinal fluid (such as 10 mL) through the epidural                                    catheter.</p>

<h1>MAXIMUM RECOMMENDED DOSAGES</h1>

<h2>Adults</h2>
<p class="First">For normal healthy adults, the individual maximum recommended dose of lidocaine HCl with epinephrine should not exceed 7 mg/kg (3.5 mg/lb) of body weight, and in general it is recommended that the maximum total dose not exceed 500 mg.  When used without epinephrine the maximum individual dose should not exceed 4.5 mg/kg (2 mg/lb) of body weight, and in general it is recommended that the maximum total dose does not exceed 300 mg.  For continuous epidural or caudal anesthesia, the maximum recommended dosage should not be administered at intervals of less than 90 minutes.  When continuous lumbar or caudal epidural anesthesia is used for non-obstetrical procedures, more drug may be administered if required to produce adequate anesthesia.</p>
<p>The maximum recommended dose per 90 minute period of lidocaine hydrochloride for paracervical block in obstetrical patients and non-obstetrical patients is 200 mg total.  One half of the total dose is usually administered to each side. Inject slowly, five minutes between sides (see also discussion of paracervical block in <span class="Bold"><a href="#dee2ae0a-5f79-432b-b723-5b3c3e3ed2ec">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>).</p>
<p>For intravenous regional anesthesia, the dose administered should not exceed 4 mg/kg in adults.</p>

<h2>Children</h2>
<p class="First">It is difficult to recommend a maximum dose of any drug for children, since this varies as a function of age and weight.  For children over 3 years of age who have a normal lean body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> and normal body development, the maximum dose is determined by the child’s age and weight.  For example, in a child of 5 years weighing 50 lbs the dose of lidocaine HCl should not exceed 75 to 100 mg (1.5 to 2 mg/lb).  The use of even more dilute solutions (ie, 0.25 to 0.5%) and total dosages not to exceed 3 mg/kg (1.4 mg/lb) are recommended for induction of intravenous regional anesthesia in children.</p>
<br><p>In order to guard against systemic toxicity, the lowest effective concentration and lowest effective dose should be used at all times.  In some cases it will be necessary to dilute available concentrations with 0.9% sodium chloride injection in order to obtain the required final concentration.</p>
<br><p>NOTE: Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever the solution and container permit.  The Injection is not to be used if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate.</p>
