<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">RECOMBINATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)] is a glycoprotein synthesized by a genetically engineered Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line. In culture, the CHO cell line secretes recombinant Factor VIII (rFVIII) into the cell culture medium. The rFVIII is purified from the culture medium utilizing a series of chromatography columns. A key step in the purification process is an immunoaffinity chromatography methodology in which a purification matrix, prepared by immobilization of a monoclonal antibody directed to Factor VIII, is utilized to selectively isolate the rFVIII in the medium. The synthesized rFVIII produced by the CHO cells has the same biological effects as human Factor VIII. Structurally the protein has a similar combination of heterogenous heavy and light chains as found in human Factor VIII.</p>
<p>RECOMBINATE is formulated as a sterile, nonpyrogenic, off-white to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">faint</span> yellow, lyophilized powder preparation of concentrated recombinant Factor VIII for intravenous injection. RECOMBINATE is available in single-dose vials, which contain nominally 250, 500 and 1000 International Units per vial. When reconstituted with the appropriate volume of diluent, the product contains the following stabilizers in maximum amounts: For 10 mL reconstitution volume: 12.5 mg/mL Albumin (Human), 0.20 mg/mL calcium, 1.5 mg/mL polyethylene glycol (3350), 180 mEq/L sodium, 55 mM histidine, 1.5 µg/Factor VIII International Unit (IU) polysorbate-80. Recombinant Von Willebrand Factor (rVWF) is coexpressed with the rFVIII and helps to stabilize it. The final product contains not more than 2 ng rVWF/IU rFVIII, which will not have any clinically relevant effect in patients with von Willebrand’s disease. The product contains no preservative.</p>
<p>Manufacturing of RECOMBINATE is shared by Baxter Healthcare Corporation and Wyeth BioPharma. The recombinant Antihemophilic Factor Concentrate (For Further Manufacturing Use), is produced by Baxter Healthcare Corporation and Wyeth BioPharma (For Further Manufacturing Use) and subsequently formulated and packaged at Baxter Healthcare Corporation.</p>
<p>Each vial of RECOMBINATE is labeled with the Factor VIII activity expressed in IU per vial. Biological potency is determined by an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> assay which is referenced to the World Health Organization (WHO) International Standard for Factor VIII:C Concentrate.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Factor VIII is the specific clotting factor deficient in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434007" conceptname="Hereditary factor VIII deficiency disease">hemophilia A</span> (classical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4236898" conceptname="Hemophilia">hemophilia</span>). <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434007" conceptname="Hereditary factor VIII deficiency disease">Hemophilia A</span> is a genetic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> disorder characterized by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">hemorrhages</span>, which may occur spontaneously or after minor <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433633" conceptname="Late effect of superficial injury">trauma</span>. The administration of RECOMBINATE provides an increase in plasma levels of Factor VIII and can temporarily correct the coagulation defect in these patients. Pharmacokinetic studies on sixty-nine (69) patients revealed the circulating mean half-life for RECOMBINATE to be 14.6 ± 4.9 hours (n=67), which was not statistically significantly different from plasma-derived HEMOFIL M, [Antihemophilic Factor (Human), Method M, Monoclonal Purified]. The mean half-life of HEMOFIL M was 14.7 ± 5.1 hours (n=61). The actual baseline recovery observed with RECOMBINATE was 123.9 ± 47.7 IU/dL (n=23), which is significantly higher than the actual HEMOFIL M baseline recovery of 101.7 ± 31.6 IU/dL (n=61). However, the calculated ratio of actual to expected recovery with RECOMBINATE (121.2 ± 48.9%) is not different on average from HEMOFIL M (123.4 ± 16.4%).</p>
<p>The clinical study of  RECOMBINATE in previously treated patients (individuals with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434007" conceptname="Hereditary factor VIII deficiency disease">hemophilia A</span> who had been treated with plasma derived Factor VIII) was based on observations made on a study group of 69 patients. These individuals received cumulative amounts of Factor VIII ranging from 20,914 to 1,383,063 IU over the 48 month study. Patients were given a total of 17,700 infusions totaling 28,090,769 IU RECOMBINATE.</p>
<p>These patients were successfully treated for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> episodes on a demand basis and also for the prevention of bleeds (prophylaxis). Spontaneous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> episodes successfully managed include hemarthroses, soft tissue and muscle bleeds. Management of hemostasis was also evaluated in surgeries. A total of 24 procedures on 13 patients were performed during this study. These included minor (e.g. tooth extraction) and major (e.g. bilateral osteotomies, thoracotomy and liver transplant) procedures. Hemostasis was maintained perioperatively and postoperatively with individualized Factor VIII replacement.</p>
<p>A study of RECOMBINATE in previously untreated patients was also performed as part of an ongoing study. The study group was comprised of seventy-nine (79)<span class="Sup">1</span> patients, of whom seventy-six (76) had received at least one infusion of RECOMBINATE. To date, this cohort has been given 12,209 infusions totaling over 11,277,043 IU of RECOMBINATE. Hemostasis was appropriately managed in spontaneous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> episodes, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439847" conceptname="Intracranial hemorrhage">intracranial hemorrhage</span> and surgical procedures.</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS and USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">The use of RECOMBINATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)] is indicated in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434007" conceptname="Hereditary factor VIII deficiency disease">hemophilia A</span> (classical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4236898" conceptname="Hemophilia">hemophilia</span>) for the prevention and control of hemorrhagic episodes.<span class="Sup">2</span> RECOMBINATE is also indicated in the perioperative management of patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434007" conceptname="Hereditary factor VIII deficiency disease">hemophilia A</span> (classical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4236898" conceptname="Hemophilia">hemophilia</span>).</p>
<p>RECOMBINATE can be of therapeutic value in patients with acquired Factor VIII inhibitors not exceeding 10 Bethesda Units per mL.<span class="Sup">3</span>  In clinical studies with RECOMBINATE, patients with inhibitors who were entered into the previously treated patient trial and those previously untreated children who have developed inhibitor activity on study, showed clinical hemostatic response when the titer of inhibitor was less than 10 Bethesda Units per mL. However, in such uses, the dosage of RECOMBINATE should be controlled by frequent laboratory determinations of circulating Factor VIII levels as well as the clinical status of the patient.</p>
<p>RECOMBINATE is not indicated in von Willebrand’s disease.</p>

<h2>Neutralizing Antibodies</h2>
<p class="First">Patients treated with antihemophilic factor (AHF) products should be carefully monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. Inhibitors have been reported following administration of RECOMBINATE predominantly in previously untreated and minimally treated patients. The risk of developing inhibitors is highest during the first 20 exposure days. If expected plasma factor VIII activity levels are not attained, or if <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> is not controlled with an expected dose, an assay that measures factor VIII inhibitor concentration should be performed (<span class="Italics">see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span> - <a href="#i4i_lab_tests_id_f9907b17-adda-4aad-8ddd-0de96f323e99">Monitoring Laboratory Tests</a></span>).</p>

<h2>Monitoring Laboratory Tests</h2>
<ul>
<li>Monitor plasma factor VIII activity levels by the one-stage clotting assay to confirm the adequate factor VIII levels have been achieved and maintained, when clinically indicated. (see<span class="Italics"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_f0ab2da1-c189-479e-b800-44fec1ea1648">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</li>
<li>Monitor for development of factor VIII inhibitors. Perform assay to determine if factor VIII inhibitor is present if expected factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> is not controlled with the expected dose of RECOMBINATE. Use Bethesda Units (BU) to titer inhibitors.</li>
<li>If the inhibitor is less than 10 BU per mL, the administration of additional RECOMBINATE concentrate may neutralize the inhibitor, and may permit an appropriate hemostatic response.</li>
<li>Adequate hemostasis may not be achieved if Inhibitor titers are above 10 BU per mL. The inhibitor titer may rise following RECOMBINATE infusion as a result of an anamnestic response to factor VIII. The treatment or prevention of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> in such patients requires the use of alternative therapeutic approaches and agents.</li>

<p>During the Previously Treated Patients (PTP) study, none of the 71 subjects developed <span class="Italics">de novo</span> evidence of Factor VIII inhibitor. However, during the phase II/III portion of the study, 1 subject with a history of inhibitors exhibited inhibitor activity at 6 months (0.8 Bethesda Units [BU]), which resolved by 9 months. One other subject in this study had detectable Factor VIII inhibitor at baseline (1.26 BU) and exhibited an anamnestic response at 6 months (10.3 BU). During a prospective pharmaco-surveillance study of subjects who received batches of RECOMBINATE containing modestly increased Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell protein levels, none of the 34 treated subjects developed a Factor VIII inhibitor.</p>
<p>During the Previously Untreated Patients (PUP) study, 22 of the 73 evaluable subjects developed inhibitors to Factor VIII. Of these, 13 subjects displayed no detectable Factor VIII inhibitors at study exit.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Each vial of RECOMBINATE is labeled with the Factor VIII activity expressed in IU per vial. This potency assignment is referenced to the World Health Organization International Standard for Factor VIII:C Concentrate and is evaluated by appropriate methodology to ensure accuracy of the results.</p>
<p>The expected <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> peak increase in Factor VIII level expressed as IU/dL of plasma or % (percent) of normal can be estimated by multiplying the dose administered per kg body weight (IU/kg) by two. This calculation is based on the clinical findings of Abildgaard <span class="Italics">et al</span><span class="Sup">4</span> and is supported by the data generated by 419 clinical pharmacokinetic studies with RECOMBINATE in 67 patients over time. This pharmacokinetic data demonstrated a peak recovery point above the pre-infusion baseline of approximately 2.0 IU/dL per IU/kg body weight.</p>
<p>Examples (Assuming patient’s baseline Factor VIII level is at &lt;1%):</p>
<p>(1)       A dose of 1750 IU RECOMBINATE administered to a 70 kg patient, <span class="Italics">i.e.</span> 25 IU/kg (1750 IU/70 kg), should be expected to cause a peak post-infusion Factor VIII increase of 25 IU/kg x 2 (IU/dL)/(IU/kg) = 50 IU/dL (50% of normal).</p>
<p>(2)       A peak level of 70% is required in a 40 kg child. In this situation, the dose would be 70 IU/dL/[2(IU/dL)/(IU/kg)] x 40 kg = 1400 IU.</p>

<p>If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> is not controlled with the recommended dose, the plasma level of Factor VIII should be determined and a sufficient dose of RECOMBINATE should be administered to achieve a satisfactory clinical response.</p>
<p>The careful control of the substitution therapy is especially important in cases of major surgery or life threatening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">hemorrhages</span>. In presence of a low titer inhibitor, doses larger than those recommended may be necessary as per standard care. </p>
<p>Although dosage can be estimated by the calculations above, it is strongly recommended that whenever possible, appropriate laboratory tests including serial Factor VIII assays be performed on the patient’s plasma at suitable intervals to assure that adequate Factor VIII levels have been reached and are maintained.</p>
<p>Patients should be evaluated for the development of Factor VIII inhibitors, if the expected plasma Factor VIII activity levels are not attained, or if <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> is not controlled with an appropriate dose.</p>

<h2>Administration: Use Aseptic Technique</h2>
<p class="First">RECOMBINATE is administered by intravenous (IV) injection after reconstitution.</p>
<p>Administer at room temperature. </p>
<p>RECOMBINATE should be administered not more than 3 hours after reconstitution.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Intravenous Syringe Injection</span></p>
<p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. The solution should be colorless to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">faint</span> yellow in appearance. If not, do not use the solution and notify Baxter immediately.</p>
<p>Plastic syringes are recommended for use with this product since proteins such as RECOMBINATE tend to stick to the surface of glass syringes.</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the blue cap from the BAXJECT II device. Connect the syringe to the BAXJECT II device. DO NOT INJECT AIR.</li>
<li>Turn over the connected vials so that the RECOMBINATE vial is on top. Draw the factor concentrate into the syringe by pulling the plunger back slowly.</li>
<li>Disconnect the syringe; attach a suitable needle and inject intravenously as instructed under <a href="#i4i_section_id_c909ed6c-a911-4f5f-8e01-7436a2034cc9">Rate of Administration</a>.</li>
<li>If a patient is to receive more than one vial of RECOMBINATE, the contents of multiple vials may be drawn into the same syringe. <span class="Bold">Please note that the BAXJECT II device is intended for use with a single vial of RECOMBINATE and Sterile Water for Injection only, therefore reconstituting and withdrawing a second vial into the syringe requires a second BAXJECT II device</span>.</li>

<h2>Rate of Administration</h2>
<p class="First">The rate of administration should be a rate that ensures the comfort of the patient. Preparations of RECOMBINATE can be administered at a rate of up to 10 mL per minute with no significant reactions when reconstituted with 10 mL sWFI.</p>
<p>The pulse rate should be determined before and during administration of RECOMBINATE. Should a significant increase in pulse rate occur, reducing the rate of administration or temporarily halting the injection usually allows the symptoms to disappear promptly.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First">Over the investigational period of the original safety and efficacy study of RECOMBINATE, none of the 69 subjects without an inhibitor at entry into the study, developed an inhibitor. In the previously untreated patient group there were 73 eligible subjects with Factor VIII levels less than or equal to 2% who received at least one RECOMBINATE treatment (median days 100, range 3-821) and who were tested for an inhibitor after treatment with RECOMBINATE. Of this group, 23 individuals (32%) developed a detectable inhibitor (median days on treatment at time of detection 10, range 3-69) and of these, 8 subjects (11%) showed a titer greater than 10 B.U.</p>
