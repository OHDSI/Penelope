<h2>Electrophysiology/Mechanisms of Action</h2>
<p class="First">In animals, amiodarone HCl is effective in the prevention or suppression of experimentally induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span>.  The antiarrhythmic effect of amiodarone may be due to at least two major properties:</p>
<dl>
<dt>1.</dt>
<dd>a prolongation of the myocardial cell-action potential duration and refractory period and</dd>
<dt>2.</dt>
<dd>noncompetitive α- and β -adrenergic inhibition.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Amiodarone prolongs the duration of the action potential of all cardiac fibers while causing minimal reduction of dV/dt (maximal upstroke velocity of the action potential).  The refractory period is prolonged in all cardiac tissues.  Amiodarone increases the cardiac refractory period without influencing resting membrane potential, except in automatic cells where the slope of the prepotential is reduced, generally reducing automaticity.  These electrophysiologic effects are reflected in a decreased sinus rate of 15 to 20%, increased PR and QT intervals of about 10%, the development of U-waves and changes in T-wave contour.  These changes should not require discontinuation of Pacerone<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets as they are evidence of its pharmacological action, although amiodarone can cause marked <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171683" conceptname="Sinus bradycardia">sinus bradycardia</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4210313" conceptname="Sinus arrest">sinus arrest</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316135" conceptname="Atrioventricular block">heart block</span>.  On rare occasions, QT prolongation has been associated with worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s12">"WARNINGS"</a></span>).</p>

<h2>Hemodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">In animal studies and after intravenous administration in man, amiodarone relaxes vascular smooth muscle, reduces peripheral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span> (afterload), and slightly increases <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208254" conceptname="Cardiac index">cardiac index</span>.  After oral dosing, however, amiodarone produces no significant change in left ventricular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4108582" conceptname="Left ventricular ejection fraction">ejection fraction</span> (LVEF), even in patients with depressed LVEF.  After acute intravenous dosing in man, amiodarone may have a mild negative inotropic effect.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Following oral administration in man, amiodarone is slowly and variably absorbed.  The bioavailability of amiodarone is approximately 50%, but has varied between 35 and 65% in various studies.  Maximum plasma concentrations are attained 3 to 7 hours after a single dose.  Despite this, the onset of action may occur in 2 to 3 days, but more commonly takes 1 to 3 weeks, even with loading doses.  Plasma concentrations with chronic dosing at 100 to 600 mg/day are approximately dose proportional, with a mean 0.5 mg/L increase for each 100 mg/day.  These means, however, include considerable individual variability.  Food increases the rate and extent of absorption of amiodarone.  The effects of food upon the bioavailability of amiodarone have been studied in 30 healthy subjects who received a single 600-mg dose immediately after consuming a high-fat meal and following an overnight fast.  The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and the peak plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of amiodarone increased by 2.3 (range 1.7 to 3.6) and 3.8 (range 2.7 to 4.4) times, respectively, in the presence of food.  Food also increased the rate of absorption of amiodarone, decreasing the time to peak plasma concentration (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) by 37%.  The mean AUC and mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> of desethylamiodarone increased by 55% (range 58 to 101%) and 32% (range 4 to 84%), respectively, but there was no change in the T<span class="Sub">max</span> in the presence of food.</p>
<p>Amiodarone has a very large but variable volume of distribution, averaging about 60 L/kg, because of extensive accumulation in various sites, especially adipose tissue and highly perfused organs, such as the liver, lung and spleen.  One major metabolite of amiodarone, desethylamiodarone (DEA), has been identified in man; it accumulates to an even greater extent in almost all tissues.  No data are available on the activity of DEA in humans, but in animals, it has significant electrophysiologic and antiarrhythmic effects generally similar to amiodarone itself.  DEA's precise role and contribution to the antiarrhythmic activity of oral amiodarone are not certain.  The development of maximal ventricular Class III effects after oral amiodarone administration in humans correlates more closely with DEA accumulation over time than with amiodarone accumulation.</p>
<p>Amiodarone is metabolized to desethylamiodarone by the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme group, specifically cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and CYP2C8.  The CYP3A4 isoenzyme is present in both the liver and intestines.</p>
<p>Amiodarone is eliminated primarily by hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion and there is negligible excretion of amiodarone or DEA in urine.  Neither amiodarone nor DEA is dialyzable.</p>
<p>In clinical studies of 2 to 7 days, clearance of amiodarone after intravenous administration in patients with VT and VF ranged between 220 and 440 mL/hr/kg.  Age, sex, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span> (cirrhosis) do not have marked effects on the disposition of amiodarone or DEA.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal impairment</span> does not influence the pharmacokinetics of amiodarone.  After a single dose of intravenous amiodarone in cirrhotic patients, significantly lower C<span class="Sub">max</span> and average concentration values are seen for DEA, but mean amiodarone levels are unchanged.  Normal subjects over 65 years of age show lower clearances (about 100 mL/hr/kg) than younger subjects (about 150 mL/hr/kg) and an increase in t<span class="Sub">½</span> from about 20 to 47 days.  In patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047088" conceptname="Left ventricular systolic dysfunction">left ventricular dysfunction</span>, the pharmacokinetics of amiodarone are not significantly altered but the terminal disposition t<span class="Sub">½</span> of DEA is prolonged.  Although no dosage adjustment for patients with renal, hepatic or cardiac abnormalities has been defined during chronic treatment with amiodarone, close clinical monitoring is prudent for elderly patients and those with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047088" conceptname="Left ventricular systolic dysfunction">left ventricular dysfunction</span>.</p>
<p>Following single dose administration in 12 healthy subjects, amiodarone exhibited multi-compartmental pharmacokinetics with a mean apparent plasma terminal elimination half-life of 58 days (range 15 to 142 days) for amiodarone and 36 days (range 14 to 75 days) for the active metabolite (DEA).  In patients, following discontinuation of chronic oral therapy, amiodarone has been shown to have a biphasic elimination with an initial one-half reduction of plasma levels after 2.5 to 10 days.  A much slower terminal plasma-elimination phase shows a half-life of the parent compound ranging from 26 to 107 days, with a mean of approximately 53 days and most patients in the 40- to 55-day range.  In the absence of a loading-dose period, steady-state plasma concentrations, at constant oral dosing, would therefore be reached between 130 and 535 days, with an average of 265 days.  For the metabolite, the mean plasma-elimination half-life was approximately 61 days.  These data probably reflect an initial elimination of drug from well-perfused tissue (the 2.5- to 10-day half-life phase), followed by a terminal phase representing extremely slow elimination from poorly perfused tissue compartments such as fat.</p>
<p>The considerable intersubject variation in both phases of elimination, as well as uncertainty as to what compartment is critical to drug effect, requires attention to individual responses once <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span> control is achieved with loading doses because the correct maintenance dose is determined, in part, by the elimination rates.  Daily maintenance doses of Pacerone<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets should be based on individual patient requirements (see "<span class="Bold"><a href="#s60">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>").</p>
<p>Amiodarone and its metabolite have a limited transplacental transfer of approximately 10 to 50%.  The parent drug and its metabolite have been detected in breast milk.</p>
<p>Amiodarone is highly protein-bound (approximately 96%).</p>
<p>Although electrophysiologic effects, such as prolongation of QTc, can be seen within hours after a parenteral dose of amiodarone, effects on abnormal rhythms are not seen before 2 to 3 days and usually require 1 to 3 weeks, even when a loading dose is used.  There may be a continued increase in effect for longer periods still.  There is evidence that the time to effect is shorter when a loading-dose regimen is used.</p>
<p>Consistent with the slow rate of elimination, antiarrhythmic effects persist for weeks or months after Pacerone<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets are discontinued, but the time of recurrence is variable and unpredictable.  In general, when the drug is resumed after recurrence of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span>, control is established relatively rapidly compared to the initial response, presumably because tissue stores were not wholly depleted at the time of recurrence.</p>

<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">There is no well-established relationship of plasma concentration to effectiveness, but it does appear that concentrations much below 1 mg/L are often ineffective and that levels above 2.5 mg/L are generally not needed.  Within individuals, dose reductions and ensuing decreased plasma concentrations can result in loss of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span> control.  Plasma-concentration measurements can be used to identify patients whose levels are unusually low, and who might benefit from a dose increase, or unusually high, and who might have dosage reduction in the hope of minimizing side effects.  Some observations have suggested a plasma concentration, dose or dose/duration relationship for side effects such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4197819" conceptname="Fibrosis of lung">pulmonary fibrosis</span>, liver-enzyme elevations, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4080669" conceptname="Keratic precipitates">corneal deposits</span> and facial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4083855" conceptname="Abnormal pigment">pigmentation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197608" conceptname="Peripheral neuritis in pregnancy">peripheral neuropathy</span>, gastrointestinal and central nervous system effects.</p>

<h2>Monitoring Effectiveness</h2>
<p class="First">Predicting the effectiveness of any antiarrhythmic agent in long-term prevention of recurrent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">ventricular tachycardia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437894" conceptname="Ventricular fibrillation">ventricular fibrillation</span> is difficult and controversial, with highly qualified investigators recommending use of ambulatory monitoring, programmed electrical stimulation with various stimulation regimens, or a combination of these, to assess response.  There is no present consensus on many aspects of how best to assess effectiveness, but there is a reasonable consensus on some aspects:</p>
<dl>
<dt>1.</dt>
<dd>If a patient with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span> does not manifest a hemodynamically unstable <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span> during electrocardiographic monitoring prior to treatment, assessment of the effectiveness of amiodarone requires some provocative approach, either exercise or programmed electrical stimulation (PES).</dd>
<dt>2.</dt>
<dd>Whether provocation is also needed in patients who do manifest their life-threatening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span> spontaneously is not settled, but there are reasons to consider PES or other provocation in such patients.  In the fraction of patients whose PES-inducible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span> can be made noninducible by amiodarone  (a fraction that has varied widely in various series from less than 10% to almost 40%, perhaps due to different stimulation criteria), the prognosis has been almost uniformly excellent, with very low recurrence (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">ventricular tachycardia</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4132309" conceptname="Sudden death">sudden death</span>) rates.  More controversial is the meaning of continued inducibility.  There has been an impression that continued inducibility in amiodarone patients may not foretell a poor prognosis but, in fact, many observers have found greater recurrence rates in patients who remain inducible than in those who do not.  A number of criteria have been proposed, however, for identifying patients who remain inducible but who seem likely nonetheless to do well on Pacerone<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets.  These criteria include increased difficulty of induction (more stimuli or more rapid stimuli), which has been reported to predict a lower rate of recurrence, and ability to tolerate the induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">ventricular tachycardia</span> without severe symptoms, a finding that has been reported to correlate with better survival but not with lower recurrence rates.  While these criteria require confirmation and further study in general, <span class="Italics">easier</span> inducibility or <span class="Italics">poorer</span> tolerance of the induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span> should suggest consideration of a need to revise treatment.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Several predictors of success not based on PES have also been suggested, including complete elimination of all nonsustained <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">ventricular tachycardia</span> on ambulatory monitoring and very low premature ventricular-beat rates (less than 1 VPB/1,000 normal beats).</p>
<p>While these issues remain unsettled for amiodarone, as for other agents, the prescriber of Pacerone<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets should have access to (direct or through referral), and familiarity with, the full range of evaluatory procedures used in the care of patients with life-threatening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span>.</p>
<p>It is difficult to describe the effectiveness rates of Pacerone<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets, as these depend on the specific <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span> treated, the success criteria used, the underlying cardiac disease of the patient, the number of drugs tried before resorting to Pacerone<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets, the duration of follow-up, the dose of amiodarone HCl, the use of additional antiarrhythmic agents and many other factors.  As amiodarone has been studied principally in patients with refractory life-threatening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span>, in whom drug therapy must be selected on the basis of response and cannot be assigned arbitrarily, randomized comparisons with other agents or placebo have not been possible.  Reports of series of treated patients with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span> and mean follow-up of one year or more have given mortality (due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span>) rates that were highly variable, ranging from less than 5% to over 30%, with most series in the range of 10 to 15%.  Overall  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span>-recurrence rates (fatal and nonfatal) also were highly variable (and, as noted above, depended on response to PES and other measures), and depend on whether patients who do not seem to respond initially are included.  In most cases, considering only patients who seemed to respond well enough to be placed on long-term treatment, recurrence rates have ranged from 20 to 40% in series with a mean follow-up of a year or more.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">Amiodarone has several potentially fatal toxicities, the most important of which is pulmonary toxicity (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="253506" conceptname="Pneumonitis">pneumonitis</span> or interstitial/alveolar <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="253506" conceptname="Pneumonitis">pneumonitis</span>) that has resulted in clinically manifest disease at rates as high as 10 to 17% in some series of patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span> given doses around 400 mg/day, and as abnormal diffusion capacity without symptoms in a much higher percentage of patients.  Pulmonary toxicity has been fatal about 10% of the time.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">Liver injury</span> is common with amiodarone, but is usually mild and evidenced only by abnormal liver enzymes.  Overt liver disease can occur, however, and has been fatal in a few cases.  Like other antiarrhythmics, amiodarone can exacerbate the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span>, e.g., by making the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span> less well tolerated or more difficult to reverse.  This has occurred in 2 to 5% of patients in various series, and significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316135" conceptname="Atrioventricular block">heart block</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171683" conceptname="Sinus bradycardia">sinus bradycardia</span> has been seen in 2 to 5%.  All of these events should be manageable in the proper clinical setting in most cases.  Although the frequency of such proarrhythmic events does not appear greater with amiodarone than with many other agents used in this population, the effects are prolonged when they occur.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Even in patients at high risk of arrhythmic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>, in whom the toxicity of amiodarone is an acceptable risk, Pacerone</span><span class="Sup">® </span><span class="Bold">Tablets pose major management problems that could be life-threatening in a population at risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4132309" conceptname="Sudden death">sudden death</span>, so that every effort should be made to utilize alternative agents first.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">The difficulty of using Pacerone</span><span class="Sup">® </span><span class="Bold">Tablets effectively and safely itself poses a significant risk to patients.  Patients with the indicated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span> must be hospitalized while the loading dose of Pacerone</span><span class="Sup">® </span><span class="Bold">Tablets is given, and a response generally requires at least one week, usually two or more.  Because absorption and elimination are variable, maintenance-dose selection is difficult, and it is not unusual to require dosage decrease or discontinuation of treatment.  In a retrospective survey of 192 patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">ventricular tachyarrhythmias</span>, 84 required dose reduction and 18 required at least temporary discontinuation because of adverse effects, and several series have reported 15 to 20% overall frequencies of discontinuation due to adverse reactions.

<h2>Pulmonary Toxicity</h2>
<p class="First">There have been post-marketing reports of acute-onset (days to weeks) pulmonary injury in patients treated with oral amiodarone with or without initial I.V. therapy. Findings have included pulmonary infiltrates and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> on X-ray, pulmonary alveolar <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">hemorrhage</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254061" conceptname="Pleural effusion">pleural effusion</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256717" conceptname="Bronchospasm">bronchospasm</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314754" conceptname="Wheezing">wheezing</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">dyspnea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="261687" conceptname="Hemoptysis">hemoptysis</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxia</span>. Some cases have progressed to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4256228" conceptname="Respiratory failure">respiratory failure</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.  Post-marketing reports describe cases of pulmonary toxicity in patients treated with low doses of amiodarone; however, reports suggest that the use of lower loading and maintenance doses of amiodarone are associated with a decreased incidence of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity.</p>
<p>Amiodarone HCl Tablets may cause a clinical syndrome of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> and progressive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">dyspnea</span> accompanied by functional, radiographic, gallium-scan, and pathological data consistent with pulmonary toxicity, the frequency of which varies from 2 to 7% in most published reports, but is as high as 10 to 17% in some reports.  Therefore, when Pacerone<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets therapy is initiated, a baseline chest X-ray and pulmonary-function tests, including diffusion capacity, should be performed.  The patient should return for a history, physical exam and chest X-ray every 3 to 6 months.</p>
<p>Pulmonary toxicity secondary to amiodarone seems to result from either indirect or direct toxicity as represented by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="253506" conceptname="Pneumonitis">pneumonitis</span> (including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4279553" conceptname="Eosinophilic asthma">eosinophilic pneumonia</span>) or interstitial/alveolar <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="253506" conceptname="Pneumonitis">pneumonitis</span>, respectively.</p>
<p>Patients with preexisting pulmonary disease have a poorer prognosis if pulmonary toxicity develops.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">Hypersensitivity</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="253506" conceptname="Pneumonitis">pneumonitis</span></span> usually appears earlier in the course of therapy and rechallenging these patients with Pacerone<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets results in a more rapid recurrence of greater severity.</p>
<p>Bronchoalveolar lavage is the procedure of choice to confirm this diagnosis, which can be made when a T suppressor/cytotoxic (CD8-positive) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320074" conceptname="Lymphocytosis">lymphocytosis</span> is noted.  Steroid therapy should be instituted and Pacerone<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets therapy discontinued in these patients.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Interstitial/alveolar <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="253506" conceptname="Pneumonitis">pneumonitis</span></span> may result from the release of oxygen radicals and/or phospholipidosis and is characterized by findings of diffuse alveolar damage, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4119786" conceptname="Interstitial lung disease">interstitial pneumonitis</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012171" conceptname="Fibrosis">fibrosis</span> in lung biopsy specimens.  Phospholipidosis (foamy cells, foamy macrophages), due to inhibition of phospholipase, will be present in most cases of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity; however, these changes also are present in approximately 50% of all patients on amiodarone therapy.  These cells should be used as markers of therapy, but not as evidence of toxicity.  A diagnosis of amiodarone-induced interstitial/alveolar <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="253506" conceptname="Pneumonitis">pneumonitis</span> should lead, at a minimum, to dose reduction or, preferably, to withdrawal of Pacerone<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets to establish reversibility, especially if other acceptable antiarrhythmic therapies are available.  Where these measures have been instituted, a reduction in symptoms of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity was usually noted within the first week, and a clinical improvement was greatest in the first two to three weeks.  Chest X-ray changes usually resolve within two to four months.  According to some experts, steroids may prove beneficial.  Prednisone in doses of 40 to 60 mg/day or equivalent doses of other steroids have been given and tapered over the course of several weeks depending upon the condition of the patient.  In some cases rechallenge with amiodarone at a lower dose has not resulted in return of toxicity. </p>
<p>In a patient receiving Pacerone<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets, any new respiratory symptoms should suggest the possibility of pulmonary toxicity, and the history, physical exam, chest X-ray and pulmonary-function tests (with diffusion capacity) should be repeated and evaluated.  A 15% decrease in diffusion capacity has a high sensitivity but only a moderate specificity for pulmonary toxicity; as the decrease in diffusion capacity approaches 30%, the sensitivity decreases but the specificity increases.  A gallium-scan also may be performed as part of the diagnostic workup.</p>
<p>Fatalities, secondary to pulmonary toxicity, have occurred in approximately 10% of cases.  However, in patients with life-threatening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span>, discontinuation of Pacerone<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets therapy due to suspected drug-induced pulmonary toxicity should be undertaken with caution, as the most common cause of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> in these patients is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4317150" conceptname="Sudden cardiac death">sudden cardiac death</span>.  Therefore, every effort should be made to rule out other causes of respiratory impairment (i.e., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span> with Swan-Ganz catheterization if necessary, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4170143" conceptname="Respiratory tract infection">respiratory infection</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440417" conceptname="Pulmonary embolism">pulmonary embolism</span>, malignancy, etc.) before discontinuing Pacerone<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets in these patients.  In addition, bronchoalveolar lavage, transbronchial lung biopsy and/or open lung biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis, especially in those cases where no acceptable alternative therapy is available.</p>
<p>If a diagnosis of amiodarone-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="253506" conceptname="Pneumonitis">pneumonitis</span> is made, Pacerone<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets should be discontinued, and treatment with steroids should be instituted.  If a diagnosis of amiodarone-induced interstitial/alveolar <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="253506" conceptname="Pneumonitis">pneumonitis</span> is made, steroid therapy should be instituted and, preferably, Pacerone<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets discontinued or, at a minimum, reduced in dosage.  Some cases of amiodarone-induced interstitial/alveolar <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="253506" conceptname="Pneumonitis">pneumonitis</span> may resolve following a reduction in Pacerone<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets dosage in conjunction with the administration of steroids.  In some patients, rechallenge at a lower dose has not resulted in return of interstitial/alveolar <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="253506" conceptname="Pneumonitis">pneumonitis</span>; however, in some patients (perhaps because of severe alveolar damage) the pulmonary lesions have not been reversible.</p>

<h2>Thyroid Abnormalities</h2>
<p class="First">Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T<span class="Sub">4</span>) to triiodothyronine (T<span class="Sub">3</span>) and may cause increased thyroxine levels, decreased T<span class="Sub">3</span> levels and increased levels of inactive reverse T<span class="Sub">3</span> (rT<span class="Sub">3</span>) in clinically euthyroid patients.  It is also a potential source of large amounts of inorganic iodine.  Because of its release of inorganic iodine, or perhaps for other reasons, amiodarone can cause either <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140673" conceptname="Hypothyroidism">hypothyroidism</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142479" conceptname="Hyperthyroidism">hyperthyroidism</span>.  Thyroid function should be monitored prior to treatment and periodically thereafter, particularly in elderly patients, and in any patient with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030041" conceptname="Thyroid nodule">thyroid nodules</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135772" conceptname="Goiter">goiter</span> or other thyroid dysfunction.  Because of the slow elimination of amiodarone and its metabolites, high plasma iodide levels, altered thyroid function and abnormal thyroid-function tests may persist for several weeks or even months following Pacerone<span class="Sup">®</span> (Amiodarone HCl) Tablets withdrawal.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140673" conceptname="Hypothyroidism">Hypothyroidism</span> has been reported in 2 to 4% of patients in most series, but in 8 to 10% in some series.  This condition may be identified by relevant clinical symptoms and particularly by elevated serum TSH levels.  In some clinically hypothyroid amiodarone-treated patients, free thyroxine index values may be normal.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140673" conceptname="Hypothyroidism">Hypothyroidism</span> is best managed by Pacerone<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets dose reduction and/or thyroid hormone supplement.  However, therapy must be individualized, and it may be necessary to discontinue Pacerone<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets in some patients.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142479" conceptname="Hyperthyroidism">Hyperthyroidism</span> occurs in about 2% of patients receiving amiodarone, but the incidence may be higher among patients with prior inadequate dietary iodine intake.  Amiodarone-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142479" conceptname="Hyperthyroidism">hyperthyroidism</span> usually poses a greater hazard to the patient than <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140673" conceptname="Hypothyroidism">hypothyroidism</span> because of the possibility of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138387" conceptname="Thyrotoxicosis">thyrotoxicosis</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span> breakthrough or aggravation, all of which may result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.

<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142479" conceptname="Hyperthyroidism">Hyperthyroidism</span> is best identified by relevant clinical symptoms and signs, accompanied usually by abnormally elevated levels of serum T<span class="Sub">3</span> RIA, and further elevations of serum T<span class="Sub">4</span>, and a subnormal serum TSH level (using a sufficiently sensitive TSH assay).  The finding of a flat TSH response to TRH is confirmatory of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142479" conceptname="Hyperthyroidism">hyperthyroidism</span> and may be sought in equivocal cases.  Since <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span> breakthroughs may accompany amiodarone-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142479" conceptname="Hyperthyroidism">hyperthyroidism</span>, aggressive medical treatment is indicated, including, if possible, dose reduction or withdrawal of Pacerone<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets.</p>
<p>The institution of antithyroid drugs, β-adrenergic blockers and/or temporary corticosteroid therapy may be necessary.  The action of antithyroid drugs may be especially delayed in amiodarone-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138387" conceptname="Thyrotoxicosis">thyrotoxicosis</span> because of substantial quantities of preformed thyroid hormones stored in the gland.  Radioactive iodine therapy is contraindicated because of the low radioiodine uptake associated with amiodarone-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142479" conceptname="Hyperthyroidism">hyperthyroidism</span>. Amiodarone-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142479" conceptname="Hyperthyroidism">hyperthyroidism</span> may be followed by a transient period of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140673" conceptname="Hypothyroidism">hypothyroidism</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s16">"WARNINGS, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138387" conceptname="Thyrotoxicosis">Thyrotoxicosis</span>"</a></span>).</p>
<p>When aggressive treatment of amiodarone-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138387" conceptname="Thyrotoxicosis">thyrotoxicosis</span> has failed or amiodarone cannot be discontinued because it is the only drug effective against the resistant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span>, surgical management may be an option.  Experience with thyroidectomy as a treatment for amiodarone-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138387" conceptname="Thyrotoxicosis">thyrotoxicosis</span> is limited, and this form of therapy could induce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133436" conceptname="Thyrotoxic crisis">thyroid storm</span>.

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Amiodarone is metabolized to desethylamiodarone by the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme group, specifically cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and CYP2C8.  The CYP3A4 isoenzyme is present in both the liver and intestines (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s7">"CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics"</a></span>).  Amiodarone is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and p-glycoprotein.  Therefore, amiodarone has the potential for interactions with drugs or substances that may be substrates, inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 and substrates of p-glycoprotein.  While only a limited number of <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> drug-drug interactions with amiodarone have been reported, the potential for other interactions should be anticipated.  This is especially important for drugs associated with serious toxicity, such as other antiarrhythmics.  If such drugs are needed, their dose should be reassessed and, where appropriate, plasma concentration measured. In view of the long and variable half-life of amiodarone, potential for drug interactions exists, not only with concomitant medication, but also with drugs administered after discontinuation of amiodarone.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Since amiodarone is a substrate for CYP3A4 and CYP2C8, drugs/substances that inhibit CYP3A4 may decrease the metabolism and increase serum concentrations of amiodarone.  Reported examples include the following:</span></p>

Monitoring for amiodarone toxicity and serial measurement of amiodarone serum concentration during concomitant protease inhibitor therapy should be considered.</p>

<p class="First">Amiodarone and one of its major metabolites, desethylamiodarone (DEA), are excreted in human milk, suggesting that breast-feeding could expose the nursing infant to a significant dose of the drug.  Nursing offspring of lactating rats administered amiodarone have been shown to be less viable and have reduced body-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gains</span>.

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of amiodarone HCl tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.  Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.  In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Adverse reactions have been very common in virtually all series of patients treated with amiodarone HCl for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span> with relatively large doses of drug (400 mg/day and above), occurring in about three-fourths of all patients and causing discontinuation in 7 to 18%.  The most serious reactions are pulmonary toxicity, exacerbation of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span> and rare serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver injury</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s12">"WARNINGS"</a></span>), but other adverse effects constitute important problems.  They are often reversible with dose reduction or cessation of amiodarone treatment.  Most of the adverse effects appear to become more frequent with continued treatment beyond six months, although rates appear to remain relatively constant beyond one year.  The time and dose relationships of adverse effects are under continued study.</p>
<p>Neurologic problems are extremely common, occurring in 20 to 40% of patients and including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4272240" conceptname="Malaise">malaise</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span> and involuntary movements, poor coordination and gait, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197608" conceptname="Peripheral neuritis in pregnancy">peripheral neuropathy</span>; they are rarely a reason to stop therapy and may respond to dose reductions or discontinuation (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s20">"PRECAUTIONS"</a></span>). There have been spontaneous reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4050856" conceptname="Peripheral demyelinating neuropathy">demyelinating polyneuropathy</span>.</p>
<p>Gastrointestinal complaints, most commonly <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">constipation</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">anorexia</span>, occur in about 25% of patients but rarely require discontinuation of drug.  These commonly occur during high-dose administration (i.e., loading dose) and usually respond to dose reduction or divided doses.</p>
<p>Ophthalmic abnormalities including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380410" conceptname="Nutritional optic neuropathy">optic neuropathy</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="374954" conceptname="Optic neuritis">optic neuritis</span>, in some cases progressing to permanent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377551" conceptname="Blind hypertensive eye">blindness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4308632" conceptname="Optic disc edema">papilledema</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372635" conceptname="Corneal degeneration">corneal degeneration</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4080920" conceptname="Phytophotodermatitis">photosensitivity</span>, eye <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090431" conceptname="Discomfort">discomfort</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377286" conceptname="Visual field defect">scotoma</span>, lens opacities and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4083487" conceptname="Macular drusen">macular degeneration</span> have been reported (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s12">"WARNINGS"</a></span>).</p>
<p>Asymptomatic corneal microdeposits are present in virtually all adult patients who have been on drug for more than 6 months.  Some patients develop eye symptoms of halos, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260194" conceptname="Photophobia">photophobia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373204" conceptname="Conjunctival xerosis">dry eyes</span>.  Vision is rarely affected and drug discontinuation is rarely needed.</p>
<p>Dermatological adverse reactions occur in about 15% of patients, with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4080920" conceptname="Phytophotodermatitis">photosensitivity</span> being most common (about 10%).  Sunscreen and protection from sun exposure may be helpful, and drug discontinuation is not usually necessary.  Prolonged exposure to amiodarone occasionally results in a blue-gray <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4083855" conceptname="Abnormal pigment">pigmentation</span>.  This is slowly and occasionally incompletely reversible on discontinuation of drug but is of cosmetic importance only.</p>
<p>Cardiovascular adverse reactions, other than exacerbation of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span>, include the uncommon occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span> (3%) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">Bradycardia</span> usually responds to dosage reduction but may require a pacemaker for control.  CHF rarely requires drug discontinuation.  Cardiac conduction abnormalities occur infrequently and are reversible on discontinuation of drug.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES, DIFFICULT DOSING SCHEDULE AND SEVERITY OF THE SIDE EFFECTS IF PATIENTS ARE IMPROPERLY MONITORED, PACERONE<span class="Sup">®</span> TABLETS SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED ONLY BY PHYSICIANS WHO ARE EXPERIENCED IN THE TREATMENT OF LIFE-THREATENING <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">ARRHYTHMIAS</span> WHO ARE THOROUGHLY FAMILIAR WITH THE RISKS AND BENEFITS OF AMIODARONE THERAPY, AND WHO HAVE ACCESS TO LABORATORY FACILITIES CAPABLE OF ADEQUATELY MONITORING THE EFFECTIVENESS AND SIDE EFFECTS OF TREATMENT.</p>
<p>In order to insure that an antiarrhythmic effect will be observed without waiting several months, loading doses are required.  A uniform, optimal dosage schedule for administration of Pacerone<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets has not been determined.  Because of the food effect on absorption, Pacerone<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets should be administered consistently with regard to meals (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s4">"CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"</a></span>).  Individual patient titration is suggested according to the following guidelines:</p>
<p><span class="Italics">For life-threatening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span>, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437894" conceptname="Ventricular fibrillation">ventricular fibrillation</span> or hemodynamically unstable <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">ventricular tachycardia</span></span>:  Close monitoring of the patients is indicated during the loading phase, particularly until risk of recurrent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">ventricular tachycardia</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226399" conceptname="Fibrillation">fibrillation</span> has abated.  Because of the serious nature of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span> and the lack of predictable time course of effect, loading should be performed in a hospital setting.  Loading doses of 800 to 1,600 mg/day are required for 1 to 3 weeks (occasionally longer) until initial therapeutic response occurs.  (Administration of Pacerone<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets in divided doses with meals is suggested for total daily doses of 1,000 mg or higher, or when gastrointestinal intolerance occurs.)  If side effects become excessive, the dose should be reduced.  Elimination of recurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437894" conceptname="Ventricular fibrillation">ventricular fibrillation</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span> usually occurs within 1 to 3 weeks, along with reduction in complex and total <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4008580" conceptname="Ventricular bigeminy">ventricular ectopic beats</span>.</p>
<p>Since grapefruit juice is known to inhibit CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of oral amiodarone in the intestinal mucosa, resulting in increased plasma levels of amiodarone, grapefruit juice should not be taken during treatment with oral amiodarone (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s34">"PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions"</a></span>).</p>
<p>Upon starting Pacerone<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets therapy, an attempt should be made to gradually discontinue prior antiarrhythmic drugs (see section on "<span class="Bold"><a href="#s34">Drug Interactions</a></span>").  When adequate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span> control is achieved, or if side effects become prominent, Pacerone<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets dose should be reduced to 600 to 800 mg/day for one month and then to the maintenance dose, usually 400 mg/day (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s9">"CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Monitoring Effectiveness"</a></span>).  Some patients may require larger maintenance doses, up to 600 mg/day, and some can be controlled on lower doses.  Pacerone<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets may be administered as a single daily dose, or in patients with severe gastrointestinal intolerance, as a b.i.d. dose.  In each patient, the chronic maintenance dose should be determined according to antiarrhythmic effect as assessed by symptoms, Holter recordings and/or programmed electrical stimulation, and by patient tolerance.  Plasma concentrations may be helpful in evaluating nonresponsiveness or unexpectedly severe toxicity (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s4">"CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"</a></span>).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">The lowest effective dose should be used to prevent the occurrence of side effects.  In all instances, the physician must be guided by the severity of the individual patient's <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span> and response to therapy.</span></p>
<p>When dosage adjustments are necessary, the patient should be closely monitored for an extended period of time because of the long and variable half-life of amiodarone and the difficulty in predicting the time required to attain a new steady-state level of drug.  Dosage suggestions are summarized below:</p>
