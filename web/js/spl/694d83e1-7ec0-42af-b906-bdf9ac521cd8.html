<h1>UROPHEN MBâ„¢Â - CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">METHENAMINE degrades in an acidic urine environment releasing formaldehyde which provides bactericidal or bacteriostatic action. It is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. 70 to 90% reaches the urine unchanged at which point it is hydrolyzed if the urine is acidic. Within 24 hours it is almost completely (90%) excreted; of this amount at pH 5, approximately 20% is formaldehyde. Protein binding - some formaldehyde is bound to substances in the urine and surrounding tissues. Methenamine is freely distributed to body tissue and fluids but is not clinically significant as it does not hydrolyze at a pH greater than 6.8.</p>
<p>BENZOIC ACID helps maintain an acid pH in the urine necessary for the degradation of methenamine.</p>
<p>PHENYL SALICYLATE releases salicylate, a mild analgesic for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>.</p>
<p>METHYLENE BLUE possesses weak antiseptic properties. It is well absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract and is rapidly reduced to leukomethylene blue which is stabilized in some combination form in the urine. 75% is excreted unchanged.</p>
<p>HYOSCYAMINE SULFATE is a parasympatholytic drug which relaxes smooth muscles and thus produces an antispasmodic effect. It is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is rapidly distributed throughout the body tissues. Most is excreted in the urine within 12 hours, 13% to 50% being unchanged. Protein binding for hyoscyamine sulfate is moderate and biotransformation is hepatic.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions:</h2>
<p class="First">Although the exact mechanism of this drug interaction is unknown, methylene blue inhibits the action of monoamine oxidase Aâ€” an enzyme responsible for breaking down serotonin in the brain. It is believed that when methylene blue is given to patients taking serotonergic psychiatric medications, high levels of serotonin can build up in the brain, causing toxicity. This is referred to as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">Serotonin Syndrome</span>. Signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">Serotonin Syndrome</span> include mental changes (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">hyperactivity</span>, memory problems), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4247265" conceptname="Muscle twitch">muscle twitching</span>, excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4190045" conceptname="Rigor">shivering</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">shaking</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, trouble with coordination, and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>.</p>

<h2>Additional Information for Healthcare Professionals:</h2>
<p class="First">Methylene blue can interact with serotonergic psychiatric medications and cause serious CNS toxicity.</p>
<p>In emergency situations requiring life-threatening or urgent treatment with methylene blue (as described above), the availability of alternative interventions should be considered and the benefit of methylene blue treatment should be weighed against the risk of serotonin toxicity. If methylene blue must be administered to a patient receiving a serotonergic drug, the serotonergic drug must be immediately stopped, and the patient should be closely monitored for emergent symptoms of CNS toxicity for two weeks (five weeks if fluoxetine [Prozac] was taken), or until 24 hours after the last dose of methylene blue, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>In non-emergency situations when non-urgent treatment with methylene blue is contemplated and planned, the serotonergic psychiatric medication should be stopped to allow its activity in the brain to dissipate. Most serotonergic psychiatric drugs should be stopped at least 2 weeks in advance of methylene blue treatment. Fluoxetine (Prozac), which has a longer half-life compared to similar drugs, should be stopped at least 5 weeks in advance.</p>
<p>Treatment with the serotonergic psychiatric medication may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of methylene blue.</p>
<p>Serotonergic psychiatric medications should not be started in a patient receiving methylene blue. Wait until 24 hours after the last dose of methylene blue before starting the antidepressant.</p>
<p>Educate your patients to recognize the symptoms of serotonin toxicity or CNS toxicity and advise them to contact a healthcare professional immediately if they experience any symptoms while taking serotonergic psychiatric medications or methylene blue.</p>
<p>As a result of hyoscyamine's effects on gastrointestinal motility and gastric emptying, absorption of other oral medications may be decreased during concurrent use with this combination medication.</p>
