<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Ticlopidine hydrochloride is a platelet aggregation inhibitor. Chemically it is 5-[(2-chlorophenyl)methyl]-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno [3,2-c] pyridine hydrochloride. The structural formula is:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="Image from Drug Label Content" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=13D85420-75E2-46E7-93EB-DCD10675CD03&amp;name=ticlopidine-hydro-01.jpg"></div>
<p>Ticlopidine hydrochloride is a white crystalline solid. It is freely soluble in water and self buffers to a pH of 3.6. It also dissolves freely in methanol, is sparingly soluble in methylene chloride and ethanol, slightly soluble in acetone, and insoluble in a buffer solution of pH 6.3. It has a molecular weight of 300.25.</p>
<p>Each tablet, for oral administration, contains 250 mg of ticlopidine hydrochloride. In addition, each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: ammonium chloride, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, starch (corn), and stearic acid. The white film coating contains hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, lactose monohydrate, titanium dioxide and triacetin.</p>

<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">When taken orally, ticlopidine hydrochloride causes a time and dose-dependent inhibition of both platelet aggregation and release of platelet granule constituents, as well as a prolongation of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4219104" conceptname="Bleeding time">bleeding time</span>. The intact drug has no significant in vitro activity at the concentrations attained in vivo; and, although analysis of urine and plasma indicates at least twenty metabolites, no metabolite which accounts for the activity of ticlopidine has been isolated.</p>
<p>Ticlopidine hydrochloride, after oral ingestion, interferes with platelet membrane function by inhibiting ADP-induced plateletfibrinogen binding and subsequent platelet-platelet interactions. The effect on platelet function is irreversible for the life of the platelet, as shown both by persistent inhibition of fibrinogen binding after washing platelets ex vivo and by inhibition of platelet aggregation after resuspension of platelets in buffered medium.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</h2>
<p class="First">After oral administration of a single 250 mg dose, ticlopidine hydrochloride is rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma levels occurring at approximately 2 hours after dosing, and is extensively metabolized. Absorption is greater than 80%. Administration after meals results in a 20% increase in the AUC of ticlopidine.</p>
<p>Ticlopidine hydrochloride displays non-linear pharmacokinetics and clearance decreases markedly on repeated dosing. In older volunteers the apparent half-life of ticlopidine after a single 250 mg dose is about 12.6 hours; with repeat dosing at 250 mg bid, the terminal elimination half-life rises to 4 to 5 days and steady-state levels of ticlopidine hydrochloride in plasma are obtained after approximately 14 to 21 days.</p>
<p>Ticlopidine hydrochloride binds reversibly (98%) to plasma proteins, mainly to serum albumin and lipoproteins. The binding to albumin and lipoproteins is nonsaturable over a wide concentration range. Ticlopidine also binds to alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. At concentrations attained with the recommended dose, only 15% or less ticlopidine in plasma is bound to this protein.</p>
<p>Ticlopidine hydrochloride is metabolized extensively by the liver; only trace amounts of intact drug are detected in the urine. Following an oral dose of radioactive ticlopidine hydrochloride administered in solution, 60% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces. Approximately 1/3 of the dose excreted in the feces is intact ticlopidine hydrochloride, possibly excreted in the bile. Ticlopidine hydrochloride is a minor component in plasma (5%) after a single dose, but at steady state is the major component (15%). Approximately 40% to 50% of the radioactive metabolites circulating in plasma are covalently bound to plasma proteins, probably by acylation.</p>
<p>Clearance of ticlopidine decreases with age. Steady state trough values in elderly patients (mean age 70 years) are about twice those in younger volunteer populations.</p>

<h3>HEPATICALLY IMPAIRED PATIENTS</h3>
<p class="First">The effect of decreased hepatic function on the pharmacokinetics of ticlopidine hydrochloride was studied in 17 patients with advanced cirrhosis. The average plasma concentration of ticlopidine in these subjects was slightly higher than that seen in older subjects in a separate trial (See <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>).</p>

<h3>RENALLY IMPAIRED PATIENTS</h3>
<p class="First">Patients with mildly (Ccr 50 to 80 mL/min) or moderately (Ccr 20 to 50 mL/min) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> were compared to normal subjects (Ccr 80 to 150 mL/min) in a study of the pharmacokinetic and platelet pharmacodynamic effects of ticlopidine hydrochloride (250 mg bid) for 11 days. Concentrations of unchanged ticlopidine hydrochloride were measured after a single 250 mg dose and after the final 250 mg dose on Day 11.</p>
<p>AUC values of ticlopidine increased by 28% and 60% in mild and moderately impaired patients, respectively, and plasma clearance decreased by 37% and 52%, respectively, but there were no statistically significant differences in ADP-induced platelet aggregation. In this small study (26 patients) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4219104" conceptname="Bleeding time">bleeding times</span> showed significant prolongation only in the moderately impaired patients.</p>

<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">In healthy volunteers over the age of 50, substantial inhibition (over 50%) of ADP-induced platelet aggregation is detected within 4 days after administration of ticlopidine hydrochloride 250 mg bid, and maximum platelet aggregation inhibition (60% to 70%) is achieved after 8 to 11 days. Lower doses cause less, and more delayed, platelet aggregation inhibition, while doses above 250 mg bid give little additional effect on platelet aggregation, but an increased rate of adverse effects. The dose of 250 mg bid is the only dose that has been evaluated in controlled clinical trials.</p>
<p>After discontinuation of ticlopidine hydrochloride, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4219104" conceptname="Bleeding time">bleeding time</span> and other platelet function tests return to normal within two weeks in the majority of patients.</p>
<p>At the recommended therapeutic dose (250 mg bid), ticlopidine hydrochloride has no known significant pharmacological actions in man other than inhibition of platelet function and prolongation of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4219104" conceptname="Bleeding time">bleeding time</span>.</p>

<h3>1. Study in Patients Experiencing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">Stroke</span> Precursors</h3>
<p class="First">In a trial comparing ticlopidine and aspirin (The Ticlopidine Aspirin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">Stroke</span> Study or TASS), 3069 patients (1987 men, 1082 women) who had experienced such <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> precursors as transient ischemic attack (TIA), transient monocular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377551" conceptname="Blind hypertensive eye">blindness</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4338523" conceptname="Amaurosis fugax">amaurosis fugax</span>), reversible ischemic neurological deficit or minor <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, were randomized to ticlopidine 250 mg bid or aspirin 650 mg bid. The study was designed to follow patients for at least 2 years and up to 5 years.</p>
<p>Over the duration of the study, ticlopidine hydrochloride significantly reduced the risk of fatal and nonfatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> by 24% (p = 0.011) from 18.1 to 13.8 per 100 patients followed for five years, compared to aspirin. During the first year, when the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> is greatest, the reduction in risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> (fatal and nonfatal) compared to aspirin was 48%; the reduction was similar in men and women.</p>

<h2>Stent Patients</h2>
<p class="First">The ability of ticlopidine hydrochloride to reduce the rate of thrombotic events after the placement of coronary artery stents has been studied in five randomized trials, one of substantial size (Stent Anticoagulation Restenosis Study or STARS) described below, and four smaller studies. In these trials, ticlopidine 250 mg bid with ASA (dose range from 100 mg bid to 325 mg qd) was compared to aspirin alone or to anticoagulant therapy plus aspirin. The trials enrolled patients undergoing both planned (elective) and unplanned coronary stent placement. The types of stents used, the use of intravascular ultrasound, and the use of high-pressure stent deployment varied among the trials, although all patients in STARS received a Palmaz-Schatz stent. The primary efficacy endpoints of the trials were similar, and included <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> and the need for repeat coronary angioplasty or CABG. All trials followed patients for at least 30 days.</p>
<p>In STARS, patients were randomized to receive one of three regimens for 4 weeks: aspirin alone, aspirin plus warfarin, or aspirin plus ticlopidine. Therapy was initiated following successful coronary stent placement. The primary endpoint was the incidence of stent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4130722" conceptname="Thrombosis">thrombosis</span>, defined as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>, Q-Wave MI, or angiographic thrombus within the stented vessel demonstrated at the time of documented <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4200991" conceptname="Ischemia">ischemia</span> requiring emergency revascularization. The incidence rates for the primary endpoint and its components at 30 days are shown in the table below:</p>

<h3>MONITORING FOR HEMATOLOGIC ADVERSE REACTIONS</h3>
<p class="First">Starting just before initiating treatment and continuing through the third month of therapy, patients receiving ticlopidine hydrochloride must be monitored every 2 weeks. Because of ticlopidine’s long plasma half-life, patients who discontinue ticlopidine during this 3-month period should continue to be monitored for 2 weeks after discontinuation. More frequent monitoring, and monitoring after the first 3 months of therapy, is necessary only in patients with clinical signs (e.g., signs or symptoms suggestive of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>) or laboratory signs (e.g., neutrophil count less than 70% of the baseline count, decrease in hematocrit or platelet count) that suggest incipient hematological adverse reactions.</p>
<p>Clinically, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span> might suggest <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span>, TTP or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137829" conceptname="Aplastic anemia">aplastic anemia</span>; TTP might also be suggested by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">weakness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260836" conceptname="Blanching of skin">pallor</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4155911" conceptname="Petechiae">petechiae</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047773" conceptname="Purpura">purpura</span>, dark urine (due to blood, bile pigments, or hemoglobin) or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span>, or neurological changes. Patients should be told to discontinue ticlopidine hydrochloride and to contact the physician immediately upon the occurrence of any of these findings. Laboratory monitoring should include a complete blood count, with special attention to the absolute neutrophil count (WBC x % <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4148615" conceptname="Neutrophil count">neutrophils</span>), platelet count, and the appearance of the peripheral smear. Ticlopidine is occasionally associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span> unrelated to TTP or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137829" conceptname="Aplastic anemia">aplastic anemia</span>. Any acute, unexplained reduction in <span class="Bold">hemoglobin </span>or platelet count should prompt further investigation for a diagnosis of TTP, and the appearance of <span class="Bold">schistocytes </span>(fragmented RBCs) on the smear should be treated as presumptive evidence of TTP. A simultaneous decrease in platelet count and WBC count should prompt further investigation for a diagnosis of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137829" conceptname="Aplastic anemia">aplastic anemia</span>. If there are laboratory signs of TTP or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137829" conceptname="Aplastic anemia">aplastic anemia</span>, or if the neutrophil count is confirmed to be &lt; 1200/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>, then ticlopidine hydrochloride should be discontinued immediately.</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Ticlopidine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients who may be at risk of increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433633" conceptname="Late effect of superficial injury">trauma</span>, surgery or pathological conditions. If it is desired to eliminate the antiplatelet effects of ticlopidine hydrochloride prior to elective surgery, the drug should be discontinued 10 to 14 days prior to surgery. Several controlled clinical studies have found increased surgical blood loss in patients undergoing surgery during treatment with ticlopidine. In TASS and CATS it was recommended that patients have ticlopidine discontinued prior to elective surgery. Several hundred patients underwent surgery during the trials, and no excessive surgical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> was reported.</p>
<p>Prolonged <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4219104" conceptname="Bleeding time">bleeding time</span> is normalized within 2 hours after administration of 20 mg methylprednisolone IV. Platelet transfusions may also be used to reverse the effect of ticlopidine hydrochloride on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>. Because platelet transfusions may accelerate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4130722" conceptname="Thrombosis">thrombosis</span> in patients with TTP on ticlopidine, they should, if possible, be avoided.</p>

<h2>Use in Hepatically Impaired Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Since ticlopidine is metabolized by the liver, dosing of ticlopidine hydrochloride or other drugs metabolized in the liver may require adjustment upon starting or stopping concomitant therapy. Because of limited experience in patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span>, who may have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> diatheses, the use of ticlopidine hydrochloride is not recommended in this population (See <span class="Bold">CLINICAL <span class="Bold">PHARMACOLOGY </span>and <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>).</span></p>

<h3>LIVER FUNCTION</h3>
<p class="First">Ticlopidine hydrochloride therapy has been associated with elevations of alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin and transaminases, which generally occurred within 1 to 4 months of therapy initiation. In controlled clinical trials, the incidence of elevated alkaline phosphatase (greater than two times upper limit of normal) was 7.6% in ticlopidine patients, 6% in placebo patients and 2.5% in aspirin patients. The incidence of elevated AST (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4094657" conceptname="Aspartate aminotransferase">SGOT</span>) (greater than two times upper limit of normal) was 3.1% in ticlopidine patients, 4% in placebo patients and 2.1% in aspirin patients. No progressive increases were observed in closely monitored clinical trials (e.g. no transaminase greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal was seen), but most patients with these abnormalities had therapy discontinued. Occasionally patients had developed minor elevations in bilirubin.</p>
<p>Post-marketing experience includes rare individuals with elevations in their transaminases and bilirubin to &gt;10x above the upper limits of normal. Based on postmarketing and clinical trial experience, liver function testing, including ALT, AST, and GGT, should be considered whenever liver dysfunction is suspected, particularly during the first 4 months of treatment.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Therapeutic doses of ticlopidine hydrochloride caused a 30% increase in the plasma half-life of antipyrine and may cause analogous effects on similarly metabolized drugs. Therefore, the dose of drugs metabolized by hepatic microsomal enzymes with low therapeutic ratios or being given to patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> may require adjustment to maintain optimal therapeutic blood levels when starting or stopping concomitant therapy with ticlopidine. Studies of specific drug interactions yielded the following results:</p>

<h3>ASPIRIN AND OTHER NSAIDs</h3>
<p class="First">Ticlopidine potentiates the effect of aspirin or other NSAIDs on platelet aggregation. The safety of concomitant use of ticlopidine with aspirin or other NSAIDs has not been established. The safety of concomitant use of ticlopidine and aspirin beyond 30 days has not been established (See <span class="Bold">CLINICAL TRIALS: Stent Patients</span>). Aspirin did not modify the ticlopidine-mediated inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation, but ticlopidine potentiated the effect of aspirin on collagen-induced platelet aggregation. Caution should be exercised in patients who have lesions with a propensity to bleed, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcers</span>. Long-term concomitant use of aspirin and ticlopidine is not recommended (See <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS - GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">Bleeding</span></span>).</p>

<h3>DIGOXIN</h3>
<p class="First">Co-administration of ticlopidine hydrochloride with digoxin resulted in a slight decrease (approximately 15%) in digoxin plasma levels. Little or no change in therapeutic efficacy of digoxin would be expected.</p>
</div>

<h3>THEOPHYLLINE</h3>
<p class="First">In normal volunteers, concomitant administration of ticlopidine hydrochloride resulted in a significant increase in the theophylline elimination half-life from 8.6 to 12.2 hours and a comparable reduction in total plasma clearance of theophylline.</p>

<h3>PHENYTOIN</h3>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies demonstrated that ticlopidine does not alter the plasma protein binding of phenytoin. However, the protein binding interactions of ticlopidine and its metabolites have not been studied <span class="Italics">in vivo</span>. Several cases of elevated phenytoin plasma levels with associated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4061577" conceptname="Lethargy">lethargy</span> have been reported following coadministration with ticlopidine hydrochloride.

<h3>OTHER CONCOMITANT THERAPY</h3>
<p class="First">Although specific interaction studies were not performed, in clinical studies ticlopidine hydrochloride was used concomitantly with beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions (See <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>).</p>

<h2>Food Interaction</h2>
<p class="First">The oral bioavailability of ticlopidine is increased by 20% when taken after a meal. Administration of ticlopidine hydrochloride with food is recommended to maximize gastrointestinal tolerance. In controlled trials in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> patients, ticlopidine hydrochloride was taken with meals.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">In a 2-year oral carcinogenicity study in rats, ticlopidine at daily doses of up to 100 mg/kg (610 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) was not tumorigenic. For a 70 kg person (1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area), the dose represents 14 times the recommended clinical dose on a mg/kg basis and two times the clinical dose on body surface area basis. In a 78-week oral carcinogenicity study in mice, ticlopidine at daily doses up to 275 mg/kg (1180 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) was not tumorigenic. The dose represents 40 times the recommended clinical dose on a mg/kg basis and four times the clinical dose on body surface area basis.</p>
<p>Ticlopidine was not mutagenic in vitro in the Ames test, the rat hepatocyte DNA-repair assay, or the Chinese-hamster fibroblast chromosomal aberration test; or <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> in the mouse spermatozoid morphology test, the Chinese-hamster micronucleus test, or the Chinese-hamster bone-marrow-cell sister-chromatid exchange test. Ticlopidine was found to have no effect on fertility of male and female rats at oral doses up to 400 mg/kg/day.</p>

<h3>PREGNANCY CATEGORY B</h3>
<p class="First">Teratology studies have been conducted in mice (doses up to 200 mg/kg/day), rats (doses up to 400 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (doses up to 200 mg/kg/day). Doses of 400 mg/kg in rats, 200 mg/kg/day in mice, and 100 mg/kg in rabbits produced maternal toxicity as well as fetal toxicity, but there was no evidence of a teratogenic potential of ticlopidine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of a human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p>

<h2>Nursing mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Studies in rats have shown ticlopidine is excreted in the milk. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from ticlopidine, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<h2>Geriatric use</h2>
<p class="First">Clearance of ticlopidine is somewhat lower in elderly patients and trough levels are increased. The major clinical trials with ticlopidine in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> patients were conducted in an elderly population with an average age of 64 years. Of the total number of patients in the therapeutic trials, 45% of patients were over 65 years old and 12% were over 75 years old. No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Adverse reactions were relatively frequent, with over 50% of patients reporting at least one. Most (30% to 40%) involved the gastrointestinal tract. Most adverse effects are mild, but 21% of patients discontinued therapy because of an adverse event, principally <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, Gl <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span>. Most adverse effects occur early in the course of treatment, but a new onset of adverse effects can occur after several months.</p>
<p>The incidence rates of adverse events listed in the following table were derived from multicenter, controlled clinical trials in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> patients described above comparing ticlopidine hydrochloride, placebo, and aspirin over study periods of up to 5.8 years.

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">One case of deliberate overdosage with ticlopidine hydrochloride has been reported by a foreign postmarketing surveillance program. A 38 year old male took a single 6000 mg dose of ticlopidine hydrochloride (equivalent to 24 standard 250 mg tablets). The only abnormalities reported were increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4219104" conceptname="Bleeding time">bleeding time</span> and increased SGPT. No special therapy was instituted and the patient recovered without sequelae.</p>
<p>Single oral doses of ticlopidine at 1600 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg were lethal to rats and mice, respectively. Symptoms of acute toxicity were Gl <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">hemorrhage</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435371" conceptname="Hypothermia">hypothermia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">dyspnea</span>, loss of equilibrium and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437643" conceptname="Abnormal gait">abnormal gait</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">Stroke</span> Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Ticlopidine hydrochloride is recommended to help reduce your risk of having a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, but only for patients who have had a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> or early warning symptoms while on aspirin, or for those who have these symptoms but are intolerant or allergic to aspirin.</p>

<h2>Special Warning for Users of Ticlopidine Hydrochloride/Necessary Blood Tests</h2>
<p class="First">Ticlopidine hydrochloride is not prescribed for those who can take aspirin to reduce the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> because ticlopidine hydrochloride can cause life-threatening blood problems. <span class="Bold">Getting your blood tests done and reporting symptoms to your <span class="Bold">doctor as soon as possible can avoid serious complications.</span></span></p>
<p>The white cells of the blood that fight <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> may drop to dangerous levels (a condition called <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span>). This occurs in about 2.4% (1 in 40) of people on ticlopidine. You should be on the lookout for signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4190045" conceptname="Rigor">chills</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="26711" conceptname="Chronic pharyngitis">sore throat</span>. If this problem is caught early, it can almost always be reversed, but if undetected it can be fatal.</p>
<p>Another problem that has occurred in some patients taking ticlopidine is a decrease in cells called platelets (a condition called <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span>). This may occur as part of a syndrome that includes injury to red blood cells, causing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span>, kidney abnormalities, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4204047" conceptname="Neurological symptom">neurologic changes</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>. This condition is called TTP and can be fatal.</p>
<p>Things you should watch for as possible early signs of TTP are <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021666" conceptname="Yellow skin">yellow skin</span> or eye colour, pinpoint dots (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>) on the skin, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260836" conceptname="Blanching of skin">pale</span> colour, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">weakness</span> on a side of the body, or dark urine. <span class="Bold">If any of these occur, contact your doctor immediately.</span></p>
<p>Both complications occur most frequently in the first 90 days after ticlopidine hydrochloride is started. To make sure you don’t develop either of these problems, <span class="Underline">your doctor will arrange for you to have your blood tested before you start taking ticlopidine hydrochloride, and then every 2 weeks for the first 3 months you are on ticlopidine hydrochloride.</span> If detected, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span> can almost always be reversed. It is <span class="Underline">essential</span> that you keep your appointments for the blood tests and that you  call your doctor immediately if you have any indication that you may have TTP or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span>. If you stop taking ticlopidine hydrochloride for any reason within the first 3 months, you will still need to have your blood tested for an additional 2 weeks after  you have stopped taking ticlopidine hydrochloride.</p>
<p>Rarely, decreases in the white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets can occur together. This condition is called <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137829" conceptname="Aplastic anemia">aplastic anemia</span> and can be fatal.</p>
<p>Things you should watch for as possible early signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137829" conceptname="Aplastic anemia">aplastic anemia</span> are feelings of excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">weakness</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">tiredness</span>, paleness, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441737" conceptname="Contusion">bruising</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> from areas such as your nose or gums. You may also develop signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>. <span class="Bold">If any of these occur, contact your doctor immediately.</span></p>

<h2>Other Warnings and Precautions</h2>
<p class="First">A few people may develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span> while being treated with ticlopidine hydrochloride. The signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span> are yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes or consistent darkening of the urine or lightening in the colour of the stools. These symptoms should be reported to your physician promptly.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">If any of the symptoms described above for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span>, TTP, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137829" conceptname="Aplastic anemia">aplastic anemia</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span> occur, contact your doctor <span class="Bold">immediately.</span></span></p>
<p>Ticlopidine hydrochloride should be used <span class="Underline">only</span> as directed by your doctor. Do not give ticlopidine hydrochloride to anyone else.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Keep ticlopidine hydrochloride out of reach of children!</span></p>
<p>Some people may have such side effects as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">skin rash</span>, stomach or intestinal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090431" conceptname="Discomfort">discomfort</span>. If any of these problems are persistent, or if you are concerned about them, bring them to your doctor’s attention.</p>
<p>It may take longer than usual to stop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> when taking ticlopidine hydrochloride. Tell your doctor if you have any more <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441737" conceptname="Contusion">bruising</span> than usual, and, if you have emergency surgery, be sure to let your doctor or dentist know that you are taking ticlopidine hydrochloride. Also, tell your doctor well in advance of any planned surgery (including tooth extraction), because he or she may recommend that you stop taking ticlopidine hydrochloride temporarily.</p>
<p>Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">Stroke</span> Patients</h2>
<p class="First">A <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> occurs when a clot (or thrombus) forms in a blood vessel in the brain or forms in another part of the body and breaks off, then travels to the brain (an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185607" conceptname="Embolism">embolus</span>). In both cases the blood supply to part of the brain is blocked and that part of the brain is damaged. Ticlopidine hydrochloride works by making the blood less likely to clot, although not so much less that it causes you to become likely to bleed, unless you have a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> disorder or some injury (such as a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcer</span> of the stomach or intestine) that is especially likely to bleed.</p>

<h2>Stent Patients</h2>
<p class="First">A <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</span> or angina (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77670" conceptname="Chest pain">chest pain</span>) can occur when fatty deposits block the arteries that carry oxygen and nutrient-rich blood to your heart. To decrease the chance of fatty deposits building up over time, the doctor may recommend the placement of a coronary stent. Ticlopidine hydrochloride may be given to you with aspirin to make blood clots less likely to form inside the stent so that the artery remains open.</p>
