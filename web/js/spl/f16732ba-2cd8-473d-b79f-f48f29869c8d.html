<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor formulated for topical ophthalmic use. </p>
<p>Dorzolamide hydrochloride is described chemically as: (4S-trans)-4-(ethylamino)-5,6-dihydro-6-methyl-4H-thieno[ 2,3-b]thiopyran-2-sulfonamide 7,7-dioxide monohydrochloride. Dorzolamide hydrochloride is optically active. </p>
<p>The specific rotation is </p>
<p>α  25°      (C=1, water) = ~ -17°. </p>
<p>     405 </p>
<p>Its empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">10</span>H<span class="Sub">16</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">4</span>S<span class="Sub">3</span>•HCl and its structural formula is:</p>
<p><img alt="MM1" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=f16732ba-2cd8-473d-b79f-f48f29869c8d&amp;name=MM1.jpg"></p>
<p>Dorzolamide hydrochloride has a molecular weight of 360.9 and a melting point of about 264°C. It is a white to offwhite, crystalline powder, which is soluble in water and slightly soluble in methanol and ethanol. </p>
<p>Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution is supplied as a sterile, isotonic, buffered, slightly viscous, aqueous solution of dorzolamide hydrochloride. The pH of the solution is approximately 5.6, and the osmolarity is 260-330 mOsM. Each mL of Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution 2% contains 20 mg dorzolamide (22.3 mg of dorzolamide hydrochloride). Inactive ingredients are hydroxyethyl cellulose, mannitol, purified water, and sodium citrate dihydrate. Sodium hydroxide may be used to adjust pH. Benzalkonium chloride 0.0075% is added as a preservative.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Carbonic anhydrase (CA) is an enzyme found in many tissues of the body including the eye. It catalyzes the reversible reaction involving the hydration of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135927" conceptname="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</span> and the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435796" conceptname="Dehydration">dehydration</span> of carbonic acid. In humans, carbonic anhydrase exists as a number of isoenzymes, the most active being carbonic anhydrase II (CA-II), found primarily in red blood cells (RBCs), but also in other tissues. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases aqueous humor secretion, presumably by slowing the formation of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span> ions with subsequent reduction in sodium and fluid transport. The result is a reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP). </p>
<p>Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution contains dorzolamide hydrochloride, an inhibitor of human carbonic anhydrase II. Following topical ocular administration, Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution reduces elevated intraocular pressure. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of optic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381732" conceptname="Nerve injury">nerve damage</span> and glaucomatous visual field loss.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>When topically applied, dorzolamide reaches the systemic circulation. To assess the potential for systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibition following topical administration, drug and metabolite concentrations in RBCs and plasma and carbonic anhydrase inhibition in RBCs were measured. Dorzolamide accumulates in RBCs during chronic dosing as a result of binding to CA-II. The parent drug forms a single N-desethyl metabolite, which inhibits CA-II less potently than the parent drug but also inhibits CA-I. The metabolite also accumulates in RBCs where it binds primarily to CA-I. Plasma concentrations of dorzolamide and metabolite are generally below the assay limit of quantitation (15nM). Dorzolamide binds moderately to plasma proteins (approximately 33%). Dorzolamide is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine; the metabolite also is excreted in urine. After dosing is stopped, dorzolamide washes out of RBCs nonlinearly, resulting in a rapid decline of drug concentration initially, followed by a slower elimination phase with a half-life of about four months. </p>
<p>To simulate the systemic exposure after long-term topical ocular administration, dorzolamide was given orally to eight healthy subjects for up to 20 weeks. The oral dose of 2 mg b.i.d. closely approximates the amount of drug delivered by topical ocular administration of Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution 2% t.i.d. Steady state was reached within 8 weeks. The inhibition of CA-II and total carbonic anhydrase activities was below the degree of inhibition anticipated to be necessary for a pharmacological effect on renal function and respiration in healthy individuals.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The efficacy of Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution was demonstrated in clinical studies in the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437541" conceptname="Glaucoma">glaucoma</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381290" conceptname="Ocular hypertension">ocular hypertension</span> (baseline IOP≥23 mmHg). The IOPlowering effect of Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution was approximately 3 to 5 mmHg throughout the day and this was consistent in clinical studies of up to one year duration. </p>
<p>The efficacy of Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution when dosed less frequently than three times a day (alone or in combination with other products) has not been established. </p>
<p>In a one year clinical study, the effect of Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution 2% t.i.d. on the corneal endothelium was compared to that of betaxolol ophthalmic solution b.i.d. and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution 0.5% b.i.d. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in corneal endothelial cell counts or in corneal thickness measurements. There was a mean loss of approximately 4% in the endothelial cell counts for each group over the one year period.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution is a sulfonamide and, although administered topically, is absorbed systemically. Therefore, the same types of adverse reactions that are attributable to sulfonamides may occur with topical administration with Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution. Fatalities have occurred, although rarely, due to severe reactions to sulfonamides including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="141651" conceptname="Stevens-Johnson syndrome">Stevens-Johnson syndrome</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443754" conceptname="Lyell's toxic epidermal necrolysis, subepidermal type">toxic epidermal necrolysis</span>, fulminant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4337543" conceptname="Hepatic necrosis">hepatic necrosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440689" conceptname="Agranulocytosis">agranulocytosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137829" conceptname="Aplastic anemia">aplastic anemia</span>, and other <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="40528016" conceptname="Disorder of hematopoietic system">blood dyscrasias</span>. Sensitization may recur when a sulfonamide is readministered irrespective of the route of administration. If signs of serious reactions or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> occur, discontinue the use of this preparation.</p>
<p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>The management of patients with acute angle-closure <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437541" conceptname="Glaucoma">glaucoma</span> requires therapeutic interventions in addition to ocular hypotensive agents. Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution has not been studied in patients with acute angle-closure <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437541" conceptname="Glaucoma">glaucoma</span>. </p>
<p>Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution has not been studied in patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (CrCl &lt; 30 mL/min). Because Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution and its metabolite are excreted predominantly by the kidney, Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution is not recommended in such patients. </p>
<p>Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution has not been studied in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> and should therefore be used with caution in such patients. </p>
<p>In clinical studies, local ocular adverse effects, primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="379019" conceptname="Conjunctivitis">conjunctivitis</span> and lid reactions, were reported with chronic administration of Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution. Many of these reactions had the clinical appearance and course of an allergic-type reaction that resolved upon discontinuation of drug therapy. If such reactions are observed, Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution should be discontinued and the patient evaluated before considering restarting the drug. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_adverse_effects_id_87441dda-91d1-49e9-b612-d92e552597a7">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span>.) </p>
<p>There is a potential for an additive effect on the known systemic effects of carbonic anhydrase inhibition in patients receiving an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution. The concomitant administration of Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors is not recommended. </p>
<p>There have been reports of bacterial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="374035" conceptname="Keratitis">keratitis</span> associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface. </p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437860" conceptname="Choroidal detachment">Choroidal detachment</span> has been reported with administration of aqueous suppressant therapy (e.g., dorzolamide) after filtration procedures.</p>
<p>There is an increased potential for developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377875" conceptname="Idiopathic corneal edema">corneal edema</span> in patients with low endothelial cell counts. Precautions should be used when prescribing Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution to this group of patients.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution is a sulfonamide and although administered topically is absorbed systemically. Therefore the same types of adverse reactions that are attributable to sulfonamides may occur with topical administration. Patients should be advised that if serious or unusual reactions including severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089139" conceptname="Skin reaction">skin reactions</span> or signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> occur, they should discontinue the use of the product (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_warnings_id_4dada175-facd-4a9d-bd1b-a600c08afd47">WARNINGS</a></span>). </p>
<p>Patients should be advised that if they develop any ocular reactions, particularly <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="379019" conceptname="Conjunctivitis">conjunctivitis</span> and lid reactions, they should discontinue use and seek their physician’s advice. </p>
<p>Patients should be instructed to avoid allowing the tip of the dispensing container to contact the eye or surrounding structures. </p>
<p>Patients should also be instructed that ocular solutions, if handled improperly or if the tip of the dispensing container contacts the eye or surrounding structures, can become contaminated by common bacteria known to cause ocular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span>. Serious damage to the eye and subsequent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377551" conceptname="Blind hypertensive eye">loss of vision</span> may result from using contaminated solutions. </p>
<p>Patients also should be advised that if they have ocular surgery or develop an intercurrent ocular condition (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433633" conceptname="Late effect of superficial injury">trauma</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>), they should immediately seek their physician’s advice concerning the continued use of the present multidose container. </p>
<p>If more than one topical ophthalmic drug is being used, the drugs should be administered at least ten minutes apart. </p>
<p>Patients should be advised that Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution contains benzalkonium chloride which may be absorbed by soft contact lenses. Contact lenses should be removed prior to administration of the solution. Lenses may be reinserted 15 minutes following Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution administration.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Although acid-base and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022093" conceptname="Electrolyte imbalance">electrolyte disturbances</span> were not reported in the clinical trials with Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution, these disturbances have been reported with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and have, in some instances, resulted in drug interactions (e.g., toxicity associated with high-dose salicylate therapy). Therefore, the potential for such drug interactions should be considered in patients receiving Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a two-year study of dorzolamide hydrochloride administered orally to male and female Sprague-Dawley rats, urinary bladder <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4034142" conceptname="Papilloma">papillomas</span> were seen in male rats in the highest dosage group of 20 mg/kg/day (250 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose). <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4034142" conceptname="Papilloma">Papillomas</span> were not seen in rats given oral doses equivalent to approximately 12 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose. No treatment-related tumors were seen in a 21-month study in female and male mice given oral doses up to 75 mg/kg/day (~900 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose).</p>
<p> The increased incidence of urinary bladder <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4034142" conceptname="Papilloma">papillomas</span> seen in the high-dose male rats is a class-effect of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in rats. Rats are particularly prone to developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4034142" conceptname="Papilloma">papillomas</span> in response to foreign bodies, compounds causing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4188213" conceptname="Crystalluria">crystalluria</span>, and diverse sodium salts. </p>
<p>No changes in bladder urothelium were seen in dogs given oral dorzolamide hydrochloride for one year at 2 mg/kg/day (25 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose) or monkeys dosed topically to the eye at 0.4 mg/kg/day (~5 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose) for one year. </p>
<p>The following tests for mutagenic potential were negative: (1) in vivo (mouse) cytogenetic assay; (2) in vitro chromosomal aberration assay; (3) alkaline elution assay; (4) V-79 assay; and (5) Ames test. </p>
<p>In reproduction studies of dorzolamide hydrochloride in rats, there were no adverse effects on the reproductive capacity of males or females at doses up to 188 or 94 times, respectively, the recommended human ophthalmic dose.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pregnancy Category C. Developmental toxicity studies with dorzolamide hydrochloride in rabbits at oral doses of ≥ 2.5 mg/kg/day (31 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose) revealed malformations of the vertebral bodies. These malformations occurred at doses that caused <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span> with decreased body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span> in dams and decreased fetal weights. No treatment-related malformations were seen at 1.0 mg/kg/day (13 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a study of dorzolamide hydrochloride in lactating rats, decreases in body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span> of 5 to 7% in offspring at an Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution Sterile Ophthalmic Solution 2% oral dose of 7.5 mg/kg/day (94 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose) were seen during lactation. A slight delay in postnatal development (incisor <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">eruption</span>, vaginal canalization and eye openings), secondary to lower fetal body weight, was noted. </p>
<p>It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Dorzolamide Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>
<p>
