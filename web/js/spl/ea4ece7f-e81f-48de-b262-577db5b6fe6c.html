<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42232-9">
<a name="s10"></a><a name="section-9"></a><p></p>
<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">The ability to tolerate lithium is greater during the acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span> phase and decreases when <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span> symptoms subside (see <a href="#section-17"> DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).<br><br>The distribution space of lithium approximates that of total body water. Lithium is primarily excreted in urine with insignificant excretion in feces. Renal excretion of lithium is proportional to its plasma concentration. The elimination half-life of lithium is approximately 24 hours. Lithium decreases sodium reabsorption by the renal tubules which could lead to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">sodium depletion</span>. Therefore, it is essential for the patient to maintain a normal diet, including salt, and an adequate fluid intake (2500-3500 mL) at least during the initial stabilization period. Decreased tolerance to lithium has been reported to ensue from protracted <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span> and, if such occur, supplemental fluid and salt should be administered under careful medical supervision and lithium intake reduced or suspended until the condition is resolved.<br><br>In addition to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, concomitant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> with elevated temperatures may also necessitate a temporary reduction or cessation of medication.<br><br>Previously existing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="141253" conceptname="Disorder of thyroid gland">thyroid disorders</span> do not necessarily constitute a contraindication to lithium treatment. Where <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140673" conceptname="Hypothyroidism">hypothyroidism</span> preexists, careful monitoring of thyroid function during lithium stabilization and maintenance allows for correction of changing thyroid parameters and/or adjustment of lithium doses, if any. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140673" conceptname="Hypothyroidism">hypothyroidism</span> occurs during lithium stabilization and maintenance, supplemental thyroid treatment may be used. In general, the concomitant use of diuretics or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors with lithium carbonate should be avoided. In those cases where concomitant use is necessary, extreme caution is advised since sodium loss from these drugs may reduce the renal clearance of lithium resulting in increased serum lithium concentrations with the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium toxicity</span>. When such combinations are used, the lithium dosage may need to be decreased, and more frequent monitoring of lithium serum concentrations is recommended. See <a href="#section-7"> WARNINGS</a> for additional caution information.<br><br>Concomitant administration of carbamazepine and lithium may increase the risk of neurotoxic side effects.<br><br>The following drugs can lower serum lithium concentrations by increasing urinary lithium excretion: acetazolamide, urea, xanthine preparations, and alkalinizing agents such as sodium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span>.<br><br>Concomitant extended use of iodide preparations, especially potassium iodide, with lithium may produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140673" conceptname="Hypothyroidism">hypothyroidism</span>.<br><br>Concurrent use of calcium channel blocking agents with lithium may increase the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4024301" conceptname="Neurotoxicity">neurotoxicity</span> in the form of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437584" conceptname="Ataxia">ataxia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremors</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377575" conceptname="Tinnitus">tinnitus</span>.<br><br>Concurrent use of metronidazole with lithium may provoke <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium toxicity</span> due to reduced renal clearance. Patients receiving such combined therapy should be monitored closely.<br><br>Concurrent use of fluoxetine with lithium has resulted in both increased and decreased serum lithium concentrations. Patients receiving such combined therapy should be monitored closely.<br><br>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Lithium levels should be closely monitored when patients initiate or discontinue NSAID use. In some cases, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium toxicity</span> has resulted from interactions between a NSAID and lithium. Indomethacin and piroxicam have been reported to increase significantly steady-state plasma lithium concentrations. There is also evidence that other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, including the selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, have the same effect. In a study conducted in healthy subjects, mean steady-state lithium plasma levels increased approximately 17% in subjects receiving lithium 450 mg BID with celecoxib 200 mg BID as compared to subjects receiving lithium alone.<br><br>Lithium may impair mental and/or physical abilities. Patients should be cautioned about activities requiring alertness (e.g., operating vehicles or machinery).<br></p>

<p>Such doses will normally produce an effective serum lithium concentration ranging between 1.0 and 1.5 mEq/L. Dosage must be individualized according to serum concentrations and clinical response. Regular monitoring of the patient's clinical state and of serum lithium concentrations is necessary. Serum concentrations should be determined twice per week during the acute phase, and until the serum concentrations and clinical condition of the patient have been stabilized.

<p>Serum lithium concentrations in uncomplicated cases receiving maintenance therapy during remission should be monitored at least every two months. Patients abnormally sensitive to lithium may exhibit toxic signs at serum concentrations of 1.0 to 1.5 mEq/L. Geriatric patients often respond to reduced dosage, and may exhibit signs of toxicity at serum concentrations ordinarily tolerated by other patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

<h2>Important Considerations
</h2>
<ul class="Disc">
<li>Blood samples for serum lithium determinations should be drawn immediately prior to the next dose when lithium concentrations are relatively stable (i.e., 8-12 hours after previous dose). Total reliance must not be placed on serum concentrations alone. Accurate patient evaluation requires both clinical and laboratory analysis.

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">The toxic concentrations for lithium (≥ 1.5 mEq/L) are close to the therapeutic concentrations (0.6-1.2 mEq/L). It is therefore important that patients and their families be cautioned to watch for early toxic symptoms and to discontinue the drug and inform the physician should they occur. (Toxic symptoms are listed in detail under  <a href="#s15">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a>.)<br><br><span class="Bold">Treatment</span><br><br>No specific antidote for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium poisoning</span> is known.  Treatment is supportive. Early symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium toxicity</span> can usually be treated by reduction or cessation of dosage of the drug and resumption of the treatment at a lower dose after 24 to 48 hours. In severe cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium poisoning</span>, the first and foremost goal of<br>treatment consists of elimination of this ion from the patient.<br><br>Treatment is essentially the same as that used in barbiturate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">poisoning</span>: 1) gastric lavage, 2) correction of fluid and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022093" conceptname="Electrolyte imbalance">electrolyte imbalance</span> and, 3) regulation of kidney functioning. Urea, mannitol, and aminophylline all produce significant increases in lithium excretion.  Hemodialysis is an effective and rapid means of removing the ion from the severely toxic patient. However, patient recovery may be slow.<br><br><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">Infection</span> prophylaxis, regular chest X-rays, and preservation of adequate respiration are essential.<br></p>
