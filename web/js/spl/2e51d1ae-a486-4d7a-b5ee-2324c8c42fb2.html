<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">The primary mode of action of glipizide in experimental animals appears to be the stimulation of insulin secretion from the beta cells of pancreatic islet tissue and is thus dependent on functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets. In humans, glipizide appears to lower the blood glucose acutely by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets. The mechanism by which glipizide lowers blood glucose during long-term administration has not been clearly established. In man, stimulation of insulin secretion by glipizide in response to a meal is undoubtedly of major importance. Fasting insulin levels are not elevated even on long-term glipizide administration, but the postprandial insulin response continues to be enhanced after at least 6 months of treatment. The insulinotropic response to a meal occurs within 30 minutes after an oral dose of glipizide in diabetic patients, but elevated insulin levels do not persist beyond the time of the meal challenge. Extrapancreatic effects may play a part in the mechanism of action of oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic drugs.</p>
<p>                   Blood sugar control persists in some patients for up to 24 hours after a single dose of glipizide, even though plasma levels have declined to a small fraction of peak levels by that time (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Pharmacokinetics">Pharmacokinetics</a></span> below).                 </p>
<p>Some patients fail to respond initially, or gradually lose their responsiveness to sulfonylurea drugs, including glipizide. Alternatively, glipizide may be effective in some patients who have not responded or have ceased to respond to other sulfonylureas.</p>

<h2>Other Effects</h2>
<p class="First">It has been shown that glipizide therapy was effective in controlling blood sugar without deleterious changes in the plasma lipoprotein profiles of patients treated for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201826" conceptname="Type 2 diabetes mellitus">NIDDM</span>.</p>
<p>In a placebo-controlled, crossover study in normal volunteers, glipizide had no antidiuretic activity and, in fact, led to a slight increase in free water clearance.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="43682-4">
<a name="Pharmacokinetics"></a><a name="section-3.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Gastrointestinal absorption of glipizide in man is uniform, rapid, and essentially complete. Peak plasma concentrations occur 1 to 3 hours after a single oral dose. The half-life of elimination ranges from 2 to 4 hours in normal subjects, whether given intravenously or orally. The metabolic and excretory patterns are similar with the two routes of administration, indicating that first-pass metabolism is not significant. Glipizide does not accumulate in plasma on repeated oral administration. It has been reported that total absorption and disposition of an oral dose was unaffected by food in normal volunteers, but absorption was delayed by about 40 minutes. Thus, glipizide was more effective when administered about 30 minutes before, rather than with, a test meal in diabetic patients. Protein binding was studied in serum from volunteers who received either oral or intravenous glipizide and found to be 98 to 99% one hour after either route of administration. The apparent volume of distribution of glipizide after intravenous administration was 11 liters, indicative of localization within the extracellular fluid compartment. In mice, no glipizide or metabolites were detectable autoradiographically in the brain or spinal cord of males or females, nor in the fetuses of pregnant females. In another study, however, very small amounts of radioactivity were detected in the fetuses of rats given labelled drug.</p>
<p>The metabolism of glipizide is extensive and occurs mainly in the liver. The primary metabolites are inactive hydroxylation products and polar conjugates and are excreted mainly in the urine. Less than 10% unchanged glipizide is found in the urine.</p>

<h2>SPECIAL WARNING ON INCREASED RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">                     The administration of oral hypoglycemic drugs has been reported to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality as compared to treatment with diet alone or diet plus insulin. This warning is based on the study conducted by the University Group <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">Diabetes</span> Program (UGDP), a long-term prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of glucose-lowering drugs in preventing or delaying vascular complications in patients with non-insulin-dependent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>. The study involved 823 patients who were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups (<span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">Diabetes</span></span>, 19, supp. 2: 747 to 830, 1970). UGDP reported that patients treated for 5 to 8 years with diet plus a fixed dose of tolbutamide (1.5 grams per day) had a rate of cardiovascular mortality approximately 2 1/2 times that of patients treated with diet alone. A significant increase in total mortality was not observed, but the use of tolbutamide was discontinued based on the increase in cardiovascular mortality, thus limiting the opportunity for the study to show an increase in overall mortality. Despite controversy regarding the interpretation of these results, the findings of the UGDP study provide an adequate basis for this warning. The patient should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of glipizide and of alternative modes of therapy.                   </span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Although only one drug in the sulfonylurea class (tolbutamide) was included in this study, it is prudent from a safety standpoint to consider that this warning may also apply to other oral hypoglycemic drugs in this class, in view of their close similarities in mode of action and chemical structure.</span></p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">Hypoglycemia</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">All sulfonylurea drugs are capable of producing severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. Proper patient selection, dosage, and instructions are important to avoid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemic episodes</span>. Renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic insufficiency</span> may cause elevated blood levels of glipizide and the latter may also diminish gluconeogenic capacity, both of which increase the risk of serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemic reactions</span>. Elderly, debilitated or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254542" conceptname="Hypopituitarism">pituitary insufficiency</span>, are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic action of glucose-lowering drugs. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">Hypoglycemia</span> may be difficult to recognize in the elderly, and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">Hypoglycemia</span> is more likely to occur when caloric intake is deficient, after severe or prolonged exercise, when alcohol is ingested, or when more than one glucose-lowering drug is used.</p>

<a name="s12"></a><a name="section-7.1.4"></a><p></p>
<h3><span class="Bold">Loss of Control of Blood Glucose</span></h3>
<p class="First">When a patient stabilized on any diabetic regimen is exposed to stress such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433633" conceptname="Late effect of superficial injury">trauma</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, or surgery, a loss of control may occur. At such times, it may be necessary to discontinue glipizide and administer insulin.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of any oral hypoglycemic drug, including glipizide, in lowering blood glucose to a desired level decreases in many patients over a period of time, which may be due to progression of the severity of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> or to diminished responsiveness to the drug. This phenomenon is known as secondary failure, to distinguish it from primary failure in which the drug is ineffective in an individual patient when first given.</p>

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Patients should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of glipizide and of alternative modes of therapy. They should also be informed about the importance of adhering to dietary instructions, of a regular exercise program, and of regular testing of urine and/or blood glucose.</p>
<p>The risks of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>, its symptoms and treatment, and conditions that predispose to its development should be explained to patients and responsible family members.

<h2>Physician Counseling Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">In initiating treatment for type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, diet should be emphasized as the primary form of treatment. Caloric restriction and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> are essential in the obese diabetic patient. Proper dietary management alone may be effective in controlling the blood glucose and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span>. The importance of regular physical activity should also be stressed, and cardiovascular risk factors should be identified and corrective measures taken where possible. Use of glipizide or other antidiabetic medications must be viewed by both the physician and patient as a treatment in addition to diet and not as a substitution or as a convenient mechanism for avoiding dietary restraint. Furthermore, loss of blood glucose control on diet alone may be transient, thus requiring only short-term administration of glipizide or other antidiabetic medications. Maintenance or discontinuation of glipizide or other antidiabetic medications should be based on clinical judgment using regular clinical and laboratory evaluations.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">                   The hypoglycemic action of sulfonylureas may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, some azoles, and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta adrenergic blocking agents. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving glipizide, the patient should be observed closely for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving glipizide, the patient should be observed closely for loss of control. <span class="Italics">In vitro </span>binding studies with human serum proteins indicate that glipizide binds differently than tolbutamide and does not interact with salicylate or dicumarol. However, caution must be exercised in extrapolating these findings to the clinical situation and in the use of glipizide with these drugs.                 </p>
<p>Certain drugs tend to produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span> and may lead to loss of control. These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving glipizide, the patient should be closely observed for loss of control. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving glipizide, the patient should be observed closely for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>.</p>
<p>A potential interaction between oral miconazole and oral hypoglycemic agents leading to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> has been reported. Whether this interaction also occurs with the intravenous, topical, or vaginal preparations of miconazole is not known. The effect of concomitant administration of fluconazole and glipizide was reported in a placebo-controlled crossover study in normal volunteers. All subjects received glipizide alone and following treatment with 100 mg of fluconazole as a single daily oral dose for 7 days. The mean percentage increase in the glipizide AUC after fluconazole administration was 56.9% (range: 35 to 81).</p>
<p>In studies assessing the effect of colesevelam on the pharmacokinetics of glipizide ER in healthy volunteers, reductions in glipizide AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span> and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of 12% and 13%, respectively were observed when colesevelam was coadministered with glipizide ER. When glipizide ER was administered 4 hours prior to colesevelam, there was no significant change in glipizide AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span> or C<span class="Sub">max</span>, -4% and 0%, respectively. Therefore, glipizide should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam to ensure that colesevelam does not reduce the absorption of glipizide.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">                   A twenty month study in rats and an eighteen month study in mice at doses up to 75 times the maximum human dose revealed no evidence of drug-related carcinogenicity. Bacterial and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mutagenicity tests were uniformly negative. Studies in rats of both sexes at doses up to 75 times the human dose showed no effects on fertility.                 </p>

<h3><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category C</span></h3>
<p class="First">Glipizide was found to be mildly fetotoxic in rat reproductive studies at all dose levels (5 to 50 mg/kg). This fetotoxicity has been similarly noted with other sulfonylureas, such as tolbutamide and tolazamide. The effect is perinatal and believed to be directly related to the pharmacologic (hypoglycemic) action of glipizide. In studies in rats and rabbits, no teratogenic effects were found. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Glipizide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<p>Because recent information suggests that abnormal blood glucose levels during pregnancy are associated with a higher incidence of congenital abnormalities, many experts recommend that insulin be used during pregnancy to maintain blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible.</p>

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>

<a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><a name="section-9"></a><p></p>
<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">               There is no well documented experience with glipizide overdosage. The acute oral toxicity was extremely low in all species tested (LD<span class="Sub">50</span> greater than 4 g/kg).             </p>
<p>Overdosage of sulfonylureas, including glipizide, can produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. Mild hypoglycemic symptoms without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372448" conceptname="Loss of consciousness">loss of consciousness</span> or neurologic findings should be treated aggressively with oral glucose and adjustments in drug dosage and/or meal patterns. Close monitoring should continue until the physician is assured that the patient is out of danger. Severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemic reactions</span> with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span>, or other neurological impairment occur infrequently, but constitute medical emergencies requiring immediate hospitalization. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380688" conceptname="Hypoglycemic coma">hypoglycemic coma</span> is diagnosed or suspected, the patient should be given a rapid intravenous injection of concentrated (50%) glucose solution. This should be followed by a continuous infusion of a more dilute (10%) glucose solution at a rate that will maintain the blood glucose at a level above 100 mg/dL. Patients should be closely monitored for a minimum of 24 to 48 hours since <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> may recur after apparent clinical recovery. Clearance of glipizide from plasma would be prolonged in persons with liver disease. Because of the extensive protein binding of glipizide, dialysis is unlikely to be of benefit.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34068-7">
<a name="s36"></a><a name="section-10"></a><p></p>
<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus with glipizide or any other hypoglycemic agent. In addition to the usual monitoring of urinary glucose, the patient's blood glucose must also be monitored periodically to determine the minimum effective dose for the patient; to detect primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication; and to detect secondary failure, i.e., loss of an adequate blood-glucose-lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4123836" conceptname="Glycosylated hemoglobin">Glycosylated hemoglobin</span> levels may also be of value in monitoring the patient's response to therapy.</p>
<p>Short-term administration of glipizide may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually controlled well on diet.</p>
<p>In general, glipizide should be given approximately 30 minutes before a meal to achieve the greatest reduction in postprandial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span>.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s37"></a><a name="section-10.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Initial Dose</h2>
<p class="First">The recommended starting dose is 5 mg, given before breakfast. Geriatric patients or those with liver disease may be started on 2.5 mg.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s38"></a><a name="section-10.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Titration</h2>
<p class="First">Dosage adjustments should ordinarily be in increments of 2.5 to 5 mg, as determined by blood glucose response. At least several days should elapse between titration steps. If response to a single dose is not satisfactory, dividing that dose may prove effective. The maximum recommended once daily dose is 15 mg. Doses above 15 mg should ordinarily be divided and given before meals of adequate caloric content. The maximum recommended total daily dose is 40 mg.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s39"></a><a name="section-10.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Maintenance</h2>
<p class="First">Some patients may be effectively controlled on a once-a-day regimen, while others show better response with divided dosing. Total daily doses above 15 mg should ordinarily be divided. Total daily doses above 30 mg have been safely given on a b.i.d. basis to long-term patients.</p>
<p>                   In elderly patients, debilitated or malnourished patients, and patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, the initial and maintenance dosing should be conservative to avoid hypo glycemic reactions (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#PRECAUTIONS">PRECAUTIONS</a></span> section).                 </p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s40"></a><a name="section-10.4"></a><p></p>
<h2>Patients Receiving Insulin</h2>
<p class="First">As with other sulfonylurea-class hypoglycemics, many stable non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients receiving insulin may be safely placed on glipizide. When transferring patients from insulin to glipizide, the following general guidelines should be considered:</p>
<dl>
<dt>•</dt>
<dd>For patients whose daily insulin requirement is 20 units or less, insulin may be discontinued and glipizide therapy may begin at usual dosages. Several days should elapse between glipizide titration steps.                   </dd>
<dt>•</dt>
<dd>For patients whose daily insulin requirement is greater than 20 units, the insulin dose should be reduced by 50% and glipizide therapy may begin at usual dosages. Subsequent reductions in insulin dosage should depend on individual patient response. Several days should elapse between glipizide titration steps.                   </dd>
</dl>
<p>During the insulin withdrawal period, the patient should test urine samples for sugar and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4017413" conceptname="Acetoacetate">ketone bodies</span> at least three times daily. Patients should be instructed to contact the prescriber immediately if these tests are abnormal. In some cases, especially when patient has been receiving greater than 40 units of insulin daily, it may be advisable to consider hospitalization during the transition period.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s41"></a><a name="section-10.5"></a><p></p>
<h2>Patients Receiving Other Oral Hypoglycemic Agents</h2>
<p class="First">As with other sulfonylurea-class hypoglycemics, no transition period is necessary when transferring patients to glipizide. Patients should be observed carefully (1 to 2 weeks) for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> when being transferred from longer half-life sulfonylureas (e.g., chlorpropamide) to glipizide due to potential overlapping of drug effect.</p>
<p>When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide ER, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced. Therefore, glipizide should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam.</p>
