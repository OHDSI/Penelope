<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Molindone HydrochlorideÂ has a pharmacological profile in laboratory animals which predominantly resembles that of other antipsychotic agents causing reduction of spontaneous locomotion and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021344" conceptname="Abusive behavior">aggressiveness</span>, suppression of a conditioned response and antagonism of the bizarre stereotyped behavior and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">hyperactivity</span> induced by amphetamines. In addition, Molindone HydrochlorideÂ antagonizes the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> caused by the tranquilizing agent tetrabenazine.</p>
<p>In human clinical studies an antipsychotic effect is achieved in the absence of muscle relaxing or incoordinating effects. Based on EEG studies, Molindone Hydrochloride exerts its effect on the ascending reticular activating system.</p>
<p>Human metabolic studies show Molindone Hydrochloride Tablets to be rapidly absorbed and metabolized when given orally. Unmetabolized drug reached a peak blood level at 1.5 hours. Pharmacological effect from a single oral dose persists for 24 to 36 hours. There are 36 recognized metabolites with less than 2 to 3% unmetabolized Molindone Hydrochloride Tablets being excreted in urine and feces.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">Tardive Dyskinesia</span></h2>
<p class="First"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">Tardive dyskinesia</span>, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> is unknown.</p>
<p>Both the risk of developing the syndrome and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.</p>
<p>There is no known treatment for established cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying disease process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.</p>
<p>Given these considerations, antipsychotics should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that, 1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are <span class="Underline">not</span> available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.</p>
<p>If signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> appear in a patient on antipsychotics, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment despite the presence of the syndrome.</p>
<p>(For further information about the description of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> and its clinical detection, please refer to the section onÂ <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_309840b1-1b66-4135-9a0d-d98fffaed604">Adverse Reactions</a></span>.)</p>

<p class="First">A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="379802" conceptname="Neuroleptic malignant syndrome">Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome</span> (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260205" conceptname="Hyperpyrexia">hyperpyrexia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4050941" conceptname="Muscle rigidity">muscle rigidity</span>, altered mental status and evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434633" conceptname="Disorder of autonomic nervous system">autonomic instability</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4088122" conceptname="Heart irregular">irregular pulse</span> or blood pressure, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">diaphoresis</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac dysrhythmias</span>).</p>
<p>The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255848" conceptname="Pneumonia">pneumonia</span>, systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4181404" conceptname="Heat stroke">heat stroke</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">drug fever</span> and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.</p>
<p>The management of NMS should include, 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.</p>
<p>If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Some patients receiving Molindone Hydrochloride may note <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> initially and they should be advised against activities requiring mental alertness until their response to the drug has been established.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">Increased activity</span> has been noted in patients receiving Molindone Hydrochloride. Caution should be exercised where <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">increased activity</span> may be harmful.</p>
<p>Molindone Hydrochloride does not lower the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> threshold in experimental animals to the degree noted with more sedating antipsychotic drugs. However, in humans <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsive seizures</span> have been reported in a few instances.</p>
<p>The physician should be aware that this tablet preparation contains calcium sulfate as an excipient and that calcium ions may interfere with the absorption of preparations containing phenytoin sodium and tetracyclines.</p>
<p>Molindone Hydrochloride has an antiemetic effect in animals. A similar effect may occur in humans and may obscure signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="193518" conceptname="Intestinal obstruction">intestinal obstruction</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4116092" conceptname="Intracranial tumor">brain tumor</span>.</p>
<p>Antipsychotic drugs elevate prolactin levels; the elevation persists during chronic administration. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with a previously detected breast cancer. Although disturbances such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79884" conceptname="Galactorrhea not associated with childbirth">galactorrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443800" conceptname="Amenorrhea">amenorrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168447" conceptname="Gynecomastia">gynecomastia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">impotence</span> have been reported, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. An increase in mammary neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of antipsychotic drugs. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date, however, have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis; the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time.</p>
<p>Molindone Hydrochloride has not been shown effective in the management of behavioral complications in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440389" conceptname="Mental retardation">mental retardation</span>.</p>

These complications have varied in severity; while in some cases symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization.</p>
<p>Molindone Hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">Tardive Dyskinesia</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">Antipsychotic drugs are known to cause a syndrome of dyskinetic movements commonly referred to as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>. The movements may appear during treatment or upon withdrawal of treatment and may be either reversible or irreversible (i.e., persistent) upon cessation of further antipsychotic administration.</p>
<p>The syndrome is known to have a variable latency for development and the duration of the latency cannot be determined reliably. It is thus wise to assume that any antipsychotic agent has the capacity to induce the syndrome and act accordingly until sufficient data has been collected to settle the issue definitively for a specific drug product. In the case of antipsychotics known to produce the irreversible syndrome, the following has been observed.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">Tardive dyskinesia</span> has appeared in some patients on long-term therapy and has also appeared after drug therapy has been discontinued. The risk appears to be greater in elderly patients on high-dose therapy, especially females. The symptoms are persistent and in some patients appear to be irreversible. The syndrome is characterized by rhythmical involuntary movements of the tongue, face, mouth or jaw (e.g., protrusion of tongue, puffing of cheeks, puckering of mouth, chewing movements). There may be involuntary movements of extremities.</p>
<p>There is no known effective treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>; antiparkinsonism agents usually do not alleviate the symptoms of this syndrome. It is suggested that all antipsychotic agents be discontinued if these symptoms appear. Should it be necessary to reinstitute treatment, or increase the dosage of the agent, or switch to a different antipsychotic agent, the syndrome may be masked. It has been reported that fine vermicular movements of the tongue may be an early sign of the syndrome and if the medication is stopped at that time the syndrome may not developÂ (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_5e10ff2a-d577-454e-84be-8c0b67d3d363">WARNINGS</a></span>).</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Symptomatic, supportive therapy should be the rule.</p>
<p>Gastric lavage is indicated for the reduction of absorption of Molindone Hydrochloride which is freely soluble in water.</p>
<p>Since the adsorption of Molindone Hydrochloride by activated charcoal has not been determined, the use of this antidote must be considered of theoretical value.</p>

Additionally, while the emetic effect of apomorphine is blocked by Molindone Hydrochloride in animals, this blocking effect has not been determined in humans.</p>
<p>A significant increase in the rate of removal of unmetabolized Molindone Hydrochloride from the body by forced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span>, peritoneal or renal dialysis would not be expected. (Only 2% of a single ingested dose of Molindone Hydrochloride is excreted unmetabolized in the urine). However, poor response of the patient may justify use of these procedures.</p>
<p>While the use of laxatives or enemas might be based on general principles, the amount of unmetabolized Molindone HydrochlorideÂ in feces is less than 1%. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373747" conceptname="Extrapyramidal disease">Extrapyramidal symptoms</span> have responded to the use of DiphenhydramineÂ (Benadryl<span class="Sup">Â®</span>)<span class="Sup">*</span>, Amantadine HCl (Symmetrel<span class="Sup">Â®</span>)<span class="Sup">â€ </span> and the synthetic anticholinergic antiparkinson agents, (i.e., Artane<span class="Sup">Â®â€¡</span>, Cogentin<span class="Sup">Â®Â§</span>, Akineton<span class="Sup">Â®Â¶</span>).</p>
