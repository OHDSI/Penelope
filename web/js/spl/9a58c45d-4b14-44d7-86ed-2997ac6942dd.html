<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Betaxolol is a β1-selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent that has weak membrane-stabilizing activity and no intrinsic sympathomimetic (partial agonist) activity. The preferential effect on β1 receptors is not absolute, however, and some inhibitory effects on β2 receptors (found chiefly in the bronchial and vascular musculature) can be expected at higher doses.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</h2>
<p class="First">In man, absorption of an oral dose is complete. There is a small and consistent first-pass effect resulting in an absolute bioavailability of 89% ± 5% that is unaffected by the concomitant ingestion of food or alcohol. Mean peak blood concentrations of 21.6 ng/ml (range 16.3 to 27.9 ng/ml) are reached between 1.5 and 6 (mean about 3) hours after a single oral dose, in healthy volunteers, of 10 mg of betaxolol. Peak concentrations for 20-mg and 40-mg doses are 2 and 4 times that of a 10-mg dose and have been shown to be linear over the dose range of 5 to 40 mg. The peak to trough ratio of plasma concentrations over 24 hours is 2.7. The mean elimination half-life in various studies in normal volunteers ranged from about 14 to 22 hours after single oral doses and is similar in chronic dosing. Steady state plasma concentrations are attained after 5 to 7 days with once-daily dosing in persons with normal renal function.</p>
<p>Betaxolol is approximately 50% bound to plasma proteins. It is eliminated primarily by liver metabolism and secondarily by renal excretion. Following oral administration, greater than 80% of a dose is recovered in the urine as betaxolol and its metabolites. Approximately 15% of the dose administered is excreted as unchanged drug, the remainder being metabolites whose contribution to the clinical effect is negligible.</p>
<p>Steady state studies in normal volunteers and hypertensive patients found no important differences in kinetics. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span>, elimination half-life was prolonged by about 33%, but clearance was unchanged, leading to little change in AUC. Dosage reductions have not routinely been necessary in these patients. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198185" conceptname="Chronic renal failure">chronic renal failure</span> undergoing dialysis, mean elimination half-life was approximately doubled, as was AUC, indicating the need for a lower initial dosage (5 mg) in these patients. The clearance of betaxolol by hemodialysis was 0.015 L/h/kg and by peritoneal dialysis, 0.010 L/h/kg. In one study (n=8), patients with stable <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span>, not on dialysis, with mean creatinine clearance of 27 ml/min showed slight increases in elimination half-life and AUC, but no change in Cmax. In a second study of 30 hypertensive patients with mild to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, there was a reduction in clearance of betaxolol with increasing degrees of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>. Inulin clearance (mL/min/1.73 m2) ranged from 70 to 107 in 7 patients with mild impairment, 41 to 69 in 14 patients with moderate impairment, and 8 to 37 in 9 patients with severe impairment. Clearance following oral dosing was reduced significantly in patients with moderate and severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (26% and 35%, respectively) when compared with those with mildly <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>. In the severely impaired group, the mean Cmax and the mean elimination half-life tended to increase (28% and 24%, respectively) when compared with the mildly impaired group. A starting dose of 5 mg is recommended in patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>.(<a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_a6700107-f1ff-4cab-889b-f814ba2c35a3">See DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>
<p>Studies in elderly patients (n=10) gave inconsistent results but suggest some impairment of elimination, with one small study (n=4) finding a mean half-life of 30 hours. A starting dose of 5 mg is suggested in older patients.</p>

<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical pharmacology studies have demonstrated the beta-adrenergic receptor blocking activity of betaxolol by (1) reduction in resting and exercise heart rate, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span>, and cardiac work load, (2) reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest and during exercise, (3) inhibition of isoproterenol-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, and (4) reduction of reflex orthostatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>.</p>
<p>The β<span class="Sub">1</span>-selectivity of betaxolol in man was shown in three ways: (1) In normal subjects, 10- and 40-mg oral doses of betaxolol, which reduced resting heart rate at least as much as 40 mg of propranolol, produced less inhibition of isoproterenol-induced increases in forearm blood flow and finger <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span> than propranolol. In this study, 10 mg of betaxolol was at least comparable to 50 mg of atenolol. Both doses of betaxolol, and the one dose of atenolol, however, had more effect on the isoproterenol-induced changes than placebo (indicating some β<span class="Sub">2</span> effect at clinical doses) and the higher dose of betaxolol was more inhibitory than the lower. (2) In normal subjects, single intravenous doses of betaxolol and propranolol, which produced equal effects on exercise-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, had differing effects on insulin-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>, with propranolol, but not betaxolol, prolonging the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> compared with placebo. Neither drugaffected the maximum extent of the hypoglycemic response. (3) In a single-blind crossover study in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatics</span> (n=10), intravenous infusion over 30 minutes of low doses of betaxolol (1.5 mg) and propranolol (2 mg) had similar effects on resting heart rate but had differing effects on FEV<span class="Sub">1 </span>and forced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4147814" conceptname="Vital capacity">vital capacity</span>, with propranolol causing statistically significant (10% to 20%) reductions from baseline in mean values for both parameters while betaxolol had no effect on mean values. While blood levels were not measured, the dose of betaxolol used in this study would be expected to produce blood concentrations, at the time of the pulmonary function studies, considerably lower than those achieved during antihypertensive therapy with recommended doses of betaxolol. In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover (4X4 Latin Square) study in 10 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatics</span>, betaxolol (about 5 or 10 mg IV) had little effect on isoproterenol-induced increases in FEV<span class="Sub">1</span>; in contrast, propranolol (about 7 mg IV) inhibited the response.</p>
<p>Consistent with its negative chronotropic effect, due to beta-blockade of the SA node, and lack of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, betaxolol increases sinus cycle length and sinus node recovery time. Conduction in the AV node is also prolonged.</p>
<p>Significant reductions in blood pressure and heart rate were observed 24 hours after dosing in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with doses of 5 to 40 mg administered once daily. The antihypertensive response to betaxolol was similar at peak blood levels (3 to 4 hours) and at trough (24 hours). In a large randomized, parallel dose-response study of 5, 10, and 20 mg, the antihypertensive effects of the 5-mg dose were roughly half of the effects of the 20-mg dose (after adjustment for placebo effects) and the 10-mg dose gave more than 80% of the antihypertensive response to the 20-mg dose. The effect of increasing the dose from 10 mg to 20 mg was thus small. In this study, while the antihypertensive response to betaxolol showed a dose-response relationship, the heart rate response (reduction in HR) was not dose related. In other trials, there was little evidence of a greater antihypertensive response to 40 mg than to 20 mg. The maximum effect of each dose was achieved within 1 or 2 weeks. In comparative trials against propranolol, atenolol, and chlorthalidone, betaxolol appeared to be at least as effective as the comparative agent.</p>
<p>Betaxolol tablets, USP has been studied in combination with thiazide-type diuretics and the blood pressure effects of the combination appear additive. Betaxolol tablets, USP has also been used concurrently with methyldopa, hydralazine, and prazosin.</p>
<p>The mechanism of the antihypertensive effects of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents has not been established. Several possible mechanisms have been proposed, however, including: (1) competitive antagonism of catecholamines at peripheral (especially cardiac) adrenergic-neuronal sites, leading to decreased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span>, (2) a central effect leading to reduced sympathetic outflow to the periphery, and (3) suppression of renin activity.</p>
<p>The results from long-term studies have not shown any diminution of the antihypertensive effect of betaxolol with prolonged use.</p>

<h2>Anesthesia and major surgery</h2>
<p class="First">The necessity, or desirability, of withdrawal of a beta-blocking therapy prior to major surgery is controversial. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade impairs the ability of the heart to respond to beta-adrenergically mediated reflex stimuli. While this might be of benefit in preventing arrhythmic response, the risk of excessive myocardial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> during general anesthesia may be increased and difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heart beat has been reported with beta-blockers. If treatment is continued, particular care should be taken when using anesthetic agents which depress the myocardium, such as ether, cyclopropane, and trichloroethylene, and it is prudent to use the lowest possible dose of betaxolol tablets, USP. Betaxolol tablets, USP, like other beta-blockers, is a competitive inhibitor of beta-receptor agonists and its effect on the heart can be reversed by cautious administration of such agents (eg, dobutamine or isoproterenol—see <a href="#i4i_overdosage_id_a2180ae2-ab4a-4f44-9bed-91ea8c11845b">OVERDOSAGE</a>). Manifestations of excessive vagal tone (eg, profound <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>) may be corrected with atropine 1 to 3 mg IV in divided doses.</p>

<p>Although <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">cardiac failure</span> rarely occurs in appropriately selected patients, patients being treated with beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be advised to consult a physician at the first sign or symptom of failure.</p>
<p>Patients should know how they react to this medicine before they operate automobiles and machinery or engage in other tasks requiring alertness. Patients should contact their physician if any difficulty in breathing occurs, and before surgery of any type.</p>
<p>Patients should inform their physicians, ophthalmologists, or dentists that they are taking betaxololtablets, USP. Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> should be warned that beta-blockers may mask <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span> occurring with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">The following drugs have been coadministered with betaxolol tablets, USP and have not altered its pharmacokinetics: cimetidine, nifedipine, chlorthalidone, and hydrochlorothiazide. Concomitant administration of betaxolol tablets, USP with the oral anticoagulant warfarin has been shown not to potentiate the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.</p>
<p>Catecholamine-depleting drugs (eg, reserpine) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents. Patients treated with a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observed for evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> or marked <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>, which may produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439383" conceptname="Vertigo">vertigo</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">syncope</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span>.</p>
<p>Should it be decided to discontinue therapy in patients receiving beta-blockers and clonidine concurrently, the beta-blocker should be discontinued slowly over several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine.</p>
<p>Literature reports suggest that oral calcium antagonists may be used in combination with beta-adrenergic blocking agents when heart function is normal, but should be avoided in patients with impaired cardiac function. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span>, AV conduction disturbances, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439846" conceptname="Left heart failure">left ventricular failure</span> have been reported in some patients receiving beta-adrenergic blocking agents when an oral calcium antagonist was added to the treatment regimen. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> was more likely to occur if the calcium antagonist were a dihydropyridine derivative, eg, nifedipine, while <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439846" conceptname="Left heart failure">left ventricular failure</span> and AV conduction disturbances, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320744" conceptname="Complete atrioventricular block">complete heart block</span>, were more likely to occur with either verapamil or diltiazem.</p>
<p>Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>.</p>
<p>Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent with negative chronotropic properties that may be additive to those seen with beta blockers. </p>
<p>Disopyramide is a Type I antiarrhythmic drug with potent negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. Disopyramide has been associated with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">asystole</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> when administered with beta blockers.</p>

<h2>Risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylactic reaction</span></h2>
<p class="First">Although it is known that patients on beta-blockers may be refractory to epinephrine in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylactic shock</span>, beta-blockers can, in addition, interfere with the modulation of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergic reaction</span> and lead to an increased severity and/or frequency of attacks. Severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergic reactions</span> including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylaxis</span> have been reported in patients exposed to a variety of allergens either by repeated challenge, or accidental contact, and with diagnostic or therapeutic agents while receiving beta-blockers. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergic reaction</span>.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Lifetime studies with betaxolol HCl in mice at oral dosages of 6, 20, and 60 mg/kg/day (up to 90 × the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] based on 60-kg body weight) and in rats at 3, 12, or 48 mg/kg/day (up to 72 × MRHD) showed no evidence of a carcinogenic effect. In a variety of in vitro and in vivo bacterial and mammalian cell assays, betaxolol HCl was nonmutagenic. Betaxolol did not adversely affect fertility or mating performance of male or female rats at doses up to 256 mg/kg/day (380 × MRHD).</p>

<h3>Pregnancy Category C</h3>
<p class="First">In a study in which pregnant rats received betaxolol at doses of 4, 40, or 400 mg/kg/day, the highest dose (600 × MRHD) was associated with increased postimplantation loss, reduced litter size and weight, and an increased incidence of skeletal and visceral abnormalities, which may have been a consequence of drug-related maternal toxicity. Other than a possible increased incidence of incomplete descent of testes and sternebral reductions, betaxolol at 4 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day (6 × MRHD and 60 × MRHD) caused no fetal abnormalities. In a second study with a different <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span> of rat, 200 mg betaxolol/kg/day (300 × MRHD) was associated with maternal toxicity and an increase in resorptions, but no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span>. In a study in which pregnant rabbits received doses of 1, 4, 12, or 36 mg betaxolol/kg/day (54 × MRHD), a marked increase in post-implantation loss occurred at the highest dose, but no drug-related <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> was observed. The rabbit is more sensitive to betaxolol than other species because of higher bioavailability resulting from saturation of the first-pass effect. In a peri- and postnatal study in rats at doses of 4, 32, and 256 mg betaxolol/kg/day (380 × MRHD), the highest dose was associated with a marked increase in total litter loss within 4 days postpartum. In surviving offspring, growth and development were also affected.</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Betaxolol tablets, USP should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Beta-blockers reduce placental perfusion, which may result in intrauterine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079844" conceptname="Fetal death">fetal death</span>, immature and premature deliveries. In addition, adverse effects (especially <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>) may occur in fetus.</p>

<h2>Neonatal period</h2>
<p class="First">The beta-blocker action persists in the neonate for several days after birth to a treated mother: there is an increased risk of cardiac and pulmonary complications in the neonate in the postnatal period. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">Bradycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4158346" conceptname="Respiratory distress">respiratory distress</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> have also been reported.

<h2>Elderly patients</h2>
<p class="First">Betaxolol tablets, USP may produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span> more frequently in elderly patients. In general, patients 65 years of age and older had a higher incidence rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span> (heart rate &lt; 50 BPM) than younger patients in U.S. clinical trials. In a double-blind study in Europe, 19 elderly patients (mean age = 82) received betaxolol 20 mg daily. Dosage reduction to 10 mg or discontinuation was required for 6 patients due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span> (<a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_a6700107-f1ff-4cab-889b-f814ba2c35a3">See DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Most adverse reactions have been mild and transient and are typical of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, eg, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">dyspnea</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4061577" conceptname="Lethargy">lethargy</span>. Withdrawal of therapy in U.S. and European controlled clinical trials has been necessary in about 3.5% of patients, principally because of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">impotence</span>.</p>
<p>Frequency estimates of adverse events were derived from controlled studies in which adverse reactions were volunteered and elicited in U.S. studies and volunteered and/or elicited in European studies.</p>
<p>In the U.S., the placebo-controlled <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> studies lasted for 4 weeks, while the active-controlled <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> studies had a 22- to 24-week double-blind phase. The following doses were studied: betaxolol—5, 10, 20, and 40 mg once daily; atenolol—25, 50, and 100 mg once daily; and propranolol—40, 80, and 160 mg b.i.d.</p>
<p>Betaxolol tablets, USP, like other beta-blockers, has been associated with the development of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255891" conceptname="Lupus erythematosus">lupus erythematosus</span>). In controlled clinical studies, conversion of ANA from negative to positive occurred in 5.3% of the patients treated with betaxolol tablets, USP, 6.3% of the patients treated with atenolol, 4.9% of the patients treated with propranolol, and 3.2% of the patients treated with placebo.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">No specific information on emergency treatment of overdosage with betaxolol tablets, USP is available. The most common effects expected are <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256717" conceptname="Bronchospasm">bronchospasm</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. In one acute overdosage of betaxolol, a 16-year-old female recovered fully after ingesting 460 mg.</p>
<p>Oral LD50s are 350 to 400 mg betaxolol/kg in mice and 860 to 980 mg/kg in rats.</p>
<p>In the case of overdosage, treatment with betaxolol tablets, USP should be stopped and the patient carefully observed. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis does not remove substantial amounts of the drug. In addition to gastric lavage, the following therapeutic measures are suggested if warranted:</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">The initial dose of betaxolol tablets, USP in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> is ordinarily 10 mg once daily either alone or added to diuretic therapy. The full antihypertensive effect is usually seen within 7 to 14 days. If the desired response is not achieved the dose can be doubled after 7 to 14 days. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg has not been shown to produce a statistically significant additional antihypertensive effect; but the 40-mg dose has been studied and is well tolerated. An increased effect (reduction) on heart rate should be anticipated with increasing dosage. If monotherapy with betaxolol tablets, USP does not produce the desired response, the addition of a diuretic agent or other antihypertensive should be considered (<a href="#i4i_interactions_id_ba6134c6-3793-4b3b-8f0d-43686be162c6">see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</a>).</p>
