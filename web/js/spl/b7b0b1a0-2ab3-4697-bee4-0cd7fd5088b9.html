<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Desloratadine is a long-acting tricyclic histamine antagonist with selective H<span class="Sub">1</span>-receptor histamine antagonist activity. Receptor binding data indicate that at a concentration of 2–3 ng/mL (7 nanomolar), desloratadine shows significant interaction with the human histamine H<span class="Sub">1</span>-receptor. Desloratadine inhibited histamine release from human mast cells <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>.</p>
<p>Results of a radiolabeled tissue distribution study in rats and a radioligand H<span class="Sub">1</span>-receptor binding study in guinea pigs showed that desloratadine did not readily cross the blood brain barrier.</p>

<h3>Absorption</h3>
<p class="First">Following oral administration of desloratadine 5 mg once daily for 10 days to normal healthy volunteers, the mean time to maximum plasma concentrations (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) occurred at approximately 3 hours post dose and mean steady state peak plasma concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 4 ng/mL and 56.9 ng∙hr/mL were observed, respectively. Neither food nor grapefruit juice had an effect on the bioavailability (C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC) of desloratadine.</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetic profile of CLARINEX Syrup was evaluated in a three-way crossover study in 30 adult volunteers. A single dose of 10 mL of CLARINEX Syrup containing 5 mg of desloratadine was bioequivalent to a single dose of 5 mg CLARINEX Tablet. Food had no effect on the bioavailability (AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of CLARINEX Syrup.</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetic profile of CLARINEX RediTabs Tablets was evaluated in a three-way crossover study in 24 adult volunteers. A single CLARINEX RediTabs Tablet containing 5 mg of desloratadine was bioequivalent to a single 5 mg CLARINEX RediTabs Tablet (original formulation) for both desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine. Water had no effect on the bioavailability (AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of CLARINEX RediTabs Tablets.</p>

<h3>Distribution</h3>
<p class="First">Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine are approximately 82% to 87% and 85% to 89%, bound to plasma proteins, respectively. Protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered in subjects with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>.</p>

<h3>Metabolism</h3>
<p class="First">Desloratadine (a major metabolite of loratadine) is extensively metabolized to 3-hydroxydesloratadine, an active metabolite, which is subsequently glucuronidated. The enzyme(s) responsible for the formation of 3-hydroxydesloratadine have not been identified. Data from clinical trials indicate that a subset of the general population has a decreased ability to form 3-hydroxydesloratadine, and are poor metabolizers of desloratadine. In pharmacokinetic studies (n=3748), approximately 6% of subjects were poor metabolizers of desloratadine (defined as a subject with an AUC ratio of 3-hydroxydesloratadine to desloratadine less than 0.1, or a subject with a desloratadine half-life exceeding 50 hours). These pharmacokinetic studies included subjects between the ages of 2 and 70 years, including 977 subjects aged 2–5 years, 1575 subjects aged 6–11 years, and 1196 subjects aged 12–70 years. There was no difference in the prevalence of poor metabolizers across age groups. The frequency of poor metabolizers was higher in Blacks (17%, n=988) as compared to Caucasians (2%, n=1462) and Hispanics (2%, n=1063). The median exposure (AUC) to desloratadine in the poor metabolizers was approximately 6-fold greater than in the subjects who are not poor metabolizers. Subjects who are poor metabolizers of desloratadine cannot be prospectively identified and will be exposed to higher levels of desloratadine following dosing with the recommended dose of desloratadine. In multidose clinical safety studies, where metabolizer status was identified, a total of 94 poor metabolizers and 123 normal metabolizers were enrolled and treated with CLARINEX Syrup for 15–35 days. In these studies, no overall differences in safety were observed between poor metabolizers and normal metabolizers. Although not seen in these studies, an increased risk of exposure-related adverse events in patients who are poor metabolizers cannot be ruled out.</p>

<h3>Elimination</h3>
<p class="First">The mean elimination half-life of desloratadine was 27 hours. C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values increased in a dose proportional manner following single oral doses between 5 and 20 mg. The degree of accumulation after 14 days of dosing was consistent with the half-life and dosing frequency. A human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> balance study documented a recovery of approximately 87% of the <span class="Sup">14</span>C-desloratadine dose, which was equally distributed in urine and feces as metabolic products. Analysis of plasma 3-hydroxydesloratadine showed similar T<span class="Sub">max</span> and half-life values compared to desloratadine.</p>

<h3>Geriatric</h3>
<p class="First">In older subjects (≥ 65 years old; n=17) following multiple-dose administration of CLARINEX Tablets, the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values for desloratadine were 20% greater than in younger subjects (&lt; 65 years old). The oral total body clearance (CL/F) when normalized for body weight was similar between the two age groups. The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was 33.7 hr in subjects ≥ 65 years old. The pharmacokinetics for 3-hydroxydesloratadine appeared unchanged in older versus younger subjects. These age-related differences are unlikely to be clinically relevant and no dosage adjustment is recommended in elderly subjects.</p>

<h3>Pediatric Subjects</h3>
<p class="First">In subjects 6 to 11 years old, a single dose of 5 mL of CLARINEX Syrup containing 2.5 mg of desloratadine resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg CLARINEX Tablet. In subjects 2 to 5 years old, a single dose of 2.5 mL of CLARINEX Syrup containing 1.25 mg of desloratadine resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg CLARINEX Tablet. However, the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">t</span> of the metabolite (3-OH desloratadine) were 1.27 and 1.61 times higher for the 5 mg dose of syrup administered in adults compared to the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">t</span> obtained in children 2–11 years of age receiving 1.25–2.5 mg of CLARINEX Syrup.</p>
<p>A single dose of either 2.5 mL or 1.25 mL of CLARINEX Syrup containing 1.25 mg or 0.625 mg, respectively, of desloratadine was administered to subjects 6 to 11 months of age and 12 to 23 months of age. The results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that a dose of 1 mg for subjects aged 6 to 11 months and 1.25 mg for subjects 12 to 23 months of age is required to obtain desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg dose of CLARINEX Syrup.</p>
<p>The CLARINEX RediTabs Tablet 2.5 mg tablet has not been evaluated in pediatric patients. Bioequivalence of the CLARINEX RediTabs Tablet and the original CLARINEX RediTabs Tablets was established in adults. In conjunction with the dose finding studies in pediatrics described, the pharmacokinetic data for CLARINEX RediTabs Tablet supports the use of the 2.5 mg dose strength in pediatric patients 6–11 years of age.</p>

<h3>Renally Impaired</h3>
<p class="First">Desloratadine pharmacokinetics following a single dose of 7.5 mg were characterized in patients with mild (n=7; creatinine clearance 51–69 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>), moderate (n=6; creatinine clearance 34–43 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>), and severe (n=6; creatinine clearance 5–29 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> or hemodialysis-dependent (n=6) patients. In patients with mild and moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, median C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values increased by approximately 1.2- and 1.9-fold, respectively, relative to subjects with normal renal function. In patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> or who were hemodialysis dependent, C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values increased by approximately 1.7- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Minimal changes in 3-hydroxydesloratadine concentrations were observed. Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were poorly removed by hemodialysis. Plasma protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>. Dosage adjustment for patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> is recommended (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_ff52ab80-c70b-4756-a3d0-66846ca39764">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span> section).</p>

<h3>Hepatically Impaired</h3>
<p class="First">Desloratadine pharmacokinetics were characterized following a single oral dose in patients with mild (n=4), moderate (n=4), and severe (n=4) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> as defined by the Child-Pugh classification of hepatic function and 8 subjects with normal hepatic function. Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>, regardless of severity, had approximately a 2.4-fold increase in AUC as compared with normal subjects. The apparent oral clearance of desloratadine in patients with mild, moderate, and severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> was 37%, 36%, and 28% of that in normal subjects, respectively. An increase in the mean elimination half-life of desloratadine in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> was observed. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine, the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values for patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> were not statistically significantly different from subjects with normal hepatic function. Dosage adjustment for patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> is recommended (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_ff52ab80-c70b-4756-a3d0-66846ca39764">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span> section).</p>

<h3>Gender</h3>
<p class="First">Female subjects treated for 14 days with CLARINEX Tablets had 10% and 3% higher desloratadine C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values, respectively, compared with male subjects. The 3-hydroxydesloratadine C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values were also increased by 45% and 48%, respectively, in females compared with males. However, these apparent differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dosage adjustment is recommended.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">In two controlled crossover clinical pharmacology studies in healthy male (n=12 in each study) and female (n=12 in each study) volunteers, desloratadine 7.5 mg (1.5 times the daily dose) once daily was coadministered with erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 200 mg every 12 hours for 10 days. In three separate controlled, parallel group clinical pharmacology studies, desloratadine at the clinical dose of 5 mg has been coadministered with azithromycin 500 mg followed by 250 mg once daily for 4 days (n=18) or with fluoxetine 20 mg once daily for 7 days after a 23-day pretreatment period with fluoxetine (n=18) or with cimetidine 600 mg every 12 hours for 14 days (n=18) under steady state conditions to normal healthy male and female volunteers. Although increased plasma concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC 0–24 hrs) of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were observed (see <a href="#id_3aa7f901-a27e-4ac9-aeda-c808f417b52a">Table 1</a>), there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine, as assessed by electrocardiographic parameters (including the corrected QT interval), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and adverse events.</p>

<p class="First">The clinical efficacy and safety of CLARINEX Tablets were evaluated in over 2,300 patients 12 to 75 years of age with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280726" conceptname="Seasonal allergic rhinitis">seasonal allergic rhinitis</span>. A total of 1,838 patients received 2.5–20 mg/day of CLARINEX in four double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 2 to 4 weeks' duration conducted in the United States. The results of these studies demonstrated the efficacy and safety of CLARINEX 5 mg in the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280726" conceptname="Seasonal allergic rhinitis">seasonal allergic rhinitis</span>. In a dose ranging trial, CLARINEX 2.5–20 mg/day was studied. Doses of 5, 7.5, 10, and 20 mg/day were superior to placebo; and no additional benefit was seen at doses above 5.0 mg. In the same study, an increase in the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> was observed at doses of 10 mg/day and 20 mg/day (5.2% and 7.6%, respectively), compared to placebo (2.3%).</p>
<p>In two 4-week studies of 924 patients (aged 15 to 75 years) with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280726" conceptname="Seasonal allergic rhinitis">seasonal allergic rhinitis</span> and concomitant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>, CLARINEX Tablets 5 mg once daily improved <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4320791" conceptname="Rhinitis">rhinitis</span> symptoms, with no decrease in pulmonary function.

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">The carcinogenic potential of desloratadine was assessed using a loratadine study in rats and a desloratadine study in mice. In a 2-year study in rats, loratadine was administered in the diet at doses up to 25 mg/kg/day (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 30 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). A significantly higher incidence of hepatocellular tumors (combined <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> and carcinomas) was observed in males given 10 mg/kg/day of loratadine and in males and females given 25 mg/kg/day of loratadine. The estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures in rats given 10 mg/kg of loratadine were approximately 7 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose. The clinical significance of these findings during long-term use of desloratadine is not known.</p>
<p>In a 2-year dietary study in mice, males and females given up to 16 mg/kg/day and 32 mg/kg/day desloratadine, respectively, did not show significant increases in the incidence of any tumors. The estimated desloratadine and metabolite exposures in mice at these doses were 12 and 27 times, respectively, the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose.</p>
<p>In genotoxicity studies with desloratadine, there was no evidence of genotoxic potential in a reverse mutation assay (<span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span>/E. coli</span> mammalian microsome bacterial mutagenicity assay) or in two assays for chromosomal aberrations (human peripheral blood lymphocyte clastogenicity assay and mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay).</p>
<p>There was no effect on female fertility in rats at desloratadine doses up to 24 mg/kg/day (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 130 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). A male specific decrease in fertility, demonstrated by reduced female conception rates, decreased sperm numbers and motility, and histopathologic testicular changes, occurred at an oral desloratadine dose of 12 mg/kg in rats (estimated desloratadine exposures were approximately 45 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). Desloratadine had no effect on fertility in rats at an oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 8 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose).</p>

<h2>Pregnancy Category C</h2>
<p class="First">Desloratadine was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 48 mg/kg/day (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 210 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose) or in rabbits at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (estimated desloratadine exposures were approximately 230 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). In a separate study, an increase in pre-implantation loss and a decreased number of implantations and fetuses were noted in female rats at 24 mg/kg (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 120 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). Reduced body weight and slow righting reflex were reported in pups at doses of 9 mg/kg/day or greater (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 50 times or greater than the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). Desloratadine had no effect on pup development at an oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 7 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, desloratadine should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p>

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">The recommended dose of CLARINEX Syrup in the pediatric population is based on cross-study comparison of the plasma concentration of CLARINEX in adults and pediatric subjects. The safety of CLARINEX Syrup has been established in 246 pediatric subjects aged 6 months to 11 years in three placebo-controlled clinical studies. Since the course of seasonal and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="40486433" conceptname="Perennial allergic rhinitis">perennial allergic rhinitis</span> and chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140803" conceptname="Idiopathic urticaria">idiopathic urticaria</span> and the effects of CLARINEX are sufficiently similar in the pediatric and adult populations, it allows extrapolation from the adult efficacy data to pediatric patients. The effectiveness of CLARINEX Syrup in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of CLARINEX Tablets in adults. The safety and effectiveness of CLARINEX Tablets or CLARINEX Syrup have not been demonstrated in pediatric patients less than 6 months of age.</p>
<p>The CLARINEX RediTabs Tablet 2.5 mg tablet has not been evaluated in pediatric patients. Bioequivalence of the CLARINEX RediTabs Tablet and the previously marketed RediTabs Tablet was established in adults. In conjunction with the dose finding studies in pediatrics described, the pharmacokinetic data for CLARINEX RediTabs Tablet supports the use of the 2.5 mg dose strength in pediatric patients 6–11 years of age.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of desloratadine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_section_id_3055f68c-026d-4fc3-b1b3-c6b7aafb86de">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY – Special Populations</a></span>).</p>

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Patients should be instructed to use CLARINEX Tablets as directed. As there are no food effects on bioavailability, patients can be instructed that CLARINEX Tablets, Syrup, or RediTabs Tablets may be taken without regard to meals. Patients should be advised not to increase the dose or dosing frequency, as studies have not demonstrated increased effectiveness at higher doses and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> may occur.

<p class="First">In multiple-dose placebo-controlled trials, 2,834 patients ages 12 years or older received CLARINEX Tablets at doses of 2.5 mg to 20 mg daily, of whom 1,655 patients received the recommended daily dose of 5 mg. In patients receiving 5 mg daily, the rate of adverse events was similar between CLARINEX and placebo-treated patients. The percent of patients who withdrew prematurely due to adverse events was 2.4% in the CLARINEX group and 2.6% in the placebo group. There were no serious adverse events in these trials in patients receiving desloratadine. All adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received the recommended daily dose of CLARINEX Tablets (5.0 mg once-daily), and that were more common with CLARINEX Tablets than placebo, are listed in Table 5.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Information regarding acute overdosage is limited to experience from clinical trials conducted during the development of the CLARINEX product. In a dose ranging trial, at doses of 10 mg and 20 mg/day <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> was reported.</p>
<p>Single daily doses of 45 mg were given to normal male and female volunteers for 10 days. All ECGs obtained in this study were manually read in a blinded fashion by a cardiologist. In CLARINEX-treated subjects, there was an increase in mean heart rate of 9.2 bpm relative to placebo. The QT interval was corrected for heart rate (QTc) by both the Bazett and Fridericia methods. Using the QTc (Bazett) there was a mean increase of 8.1 msec in CLARINEX-treated subjects relative to placebo. Using QTc (Fridericia) there was a mean increase of 0.4 msec in CLARINEX-treated subjects relative to placebo. No clinically relevant adverse events were reported.</p>
<p>In the event of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, consider standard measures to remove any unabsorbed drug. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. Desloratadine and 3-hydroxy-desloratadine are not eliminated by hemodialysis.</p>
<p>Lethality occurred in rats at oral doses of 250 mg/kg or greater (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 120 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). The oral median lethal dose in mice was 353 mg/kg (estimated desloratadine exposures were approximately 290 times the human daily oral dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). No <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> occurred at oral doses up to 250 mg/kg in monkeys (estimated desloratadine exposures were approximately 810 times the human daily oral dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).</p>
