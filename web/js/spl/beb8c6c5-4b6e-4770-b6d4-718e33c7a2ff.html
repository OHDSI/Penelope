<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">There is evidence that the metabolism of fluorouracil in the anabolic pathway blocks the methylation reaction of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.Â  In this manner, fluorouracil interferes with the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and to a lesser extent inhibits the formation of ribonucleic acid (RNA).Â  Since DNA and RNA are essential to cell division and growth, the effect of fluorouracil may be to create a thymine deficiency which provokes unbalanced growth and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> of the cell.Â  The effects of DNA and RNA deprivation are most marked on those cells which grow more rapidly and which take up fluorouracil at a more rapid rate.</p>
<p>Following intravenous injection, fluorouracil distributes into tumors, intestinal mucosa, bone marrow, liver and other tissues throughout the body.Â  In spite of its limited lipid solubility, fluorouracil diffuses readily across the blood-brain barrier and distributes into cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue.</p>
<p>Seven to 20 percent of the parent drug is excreted unchanged in the urine in 6 hours; of this, over 90% is excreted in the first hour.Â  The remaining percentage of the administered dose is metabolized, primarily in the liver.Â  The catabolic metabolism of fluorouracil results in degradation products (e.g., CO<span class="Sub">2</span>, urea and Î±-fluoro-ÃŸ-alanine) which are inactive.Â  The inactive metabolites are excreted in the urine over the next 3 to 4 hours.Â  When fluorouracil is labeled in the six carbon position, thus preventing the <span class="Sup">14</span>C metabolism to CO<span class="Sub">2</span>, approximately 90% of the total radioactivity is excreted in the urine.Â  When fluorouracil is labeled in the two carbon position, approximately 90% of the total radioactivity is excreted in expired CO<span class="Sub">2</span>.Â  Ninety percent of the dose is accounted for during the first 24 hours following intravenous administration.</p>
<p>Following intravenous administration of fluorouracil, the mean half-life of elimination from plasma is approximately 16 minutes, with a range of 8 to 20 minutes, and is dose dependent.Â  No intact drug can be detected in the plasma 3 hours after an intravenous injection.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First">THE DAILY DOSE OF FLUOROURACIL IS NOT TO EXCEED 800 MG.Â  IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT PATIENTS BE HOSPITALIZED DURING THEIR FIRST COURSE OF TREATMENT.</p>
<p>Fluorouracil should be used with extreme caution in poor risk patients with a history of high-dose pelvic irradiation or previous use of alkylating agents, those who have widespread involvement of bone marrow by metastatic tumors or those with impaired hepatic or renal function.</p>
<p>Rarely, unexpected, severe toxicity (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138455" conceptname="Stomatitis">stomatitis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4024301" conceptname="Neurotoxicity">neurotoxicity</span>) associated with 5-fluorouracil has been attributed to deficiency of dipyrimidine dehydrogenase activity.<span class="Sup">1</span>Â  A few patients have been rechallenged with 5-fluorouracil and despite 5-fluorouracil dose lowering, toxicity recurred and progressed with worse morbidity.Â  Absence of this catabolic enzyme appears to result in prolonged clearance of 5-fluorouracil.</p>

<h2>Pregnancy</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category D.</span></span></p>
<p>Fluorouracil may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.Â  Fluorouracil has been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals.Â  Fluorouracil exhibited maximum <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> when given to mice as single intraperitoneal injections of 10 to 40 mg/kg on day 10 or 12 of gestation.Â  Similarly, intraperitoneal doses of 12 to 37 mg/kg given to rats between days 9 and 12 of gestation and intramuscular doses of 3 to 9 mg given to hamsters between days 8 and 11 of gestation were teratogenic.Â  Malformations included <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135923" conceptname="Cleft palate">cleft palates</span>, skeletal defects and deformed appendages, paws and tails.Â  The dosages which were teratogenic in animals are 1 to 3 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose.Â  In monkeys, divided doses of 40 mg/kg given between days 20 and 24 of gestation were not teratogenic.</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with Fluorouracil in pregnant women.Â  While there is no evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> in humans due to Fluorouracil, it should be kept in mind that other drugs which inhibit DNA synthesis (e.g., methotrexate and aminopterin) have been reported to be teratogenic in humans.Â  Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant.Â  If the drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking the drug, the patient should be told of the potential hazard to the fetus.Â  Fluorouracil should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Fluorouracil is a highly toxic drug with a narrow margin of safety.Â  Therefore, patients should be carefully supervised, since therapeutic response is unlikely to occur without some evidence of toxicity.Â  Severe hematological toxicity, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">gastrointestinal hemorrhage</span> and even <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> may result from the use of Fluorouracil despite meticulous selection of patients and careful adjustment of dosage.Â  Although severe toxicity is more likely in poor risk patients, fatalities may be encountered occasionally even in patients in relatively good condition.</p>
<p>Therapy is to be discontinued promptly whenever one of the following signs of toxicity appears:</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility<br>
</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Carcinogenesis</span></span></p>
<p>Long-term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of fluorouracil have not been conducted.Â  However, there was no evidence of carcinogenicity in small groups of rats given fluorouracil orally at doses of 0.01, 0.3, 1 or 3 mg per rat 5 days per week for 52 weeks, followed by a 6-month observation period.Â  Also, in other studies, 33 mg/kg of fluorouracil was administered intravenously to male rats once a week for 52 weeks followed by observation for the remainder of their lifetimes with no evidence of carcinogenicity.Â  Female mice were given 1 mg of fluorouracil intravenously once a week for 16 weeks with no effect on the incidence of lung <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span>.Â  On the basis of the available data, no evaluation can be made of the carcinogenic risk of fluorouracil to humans.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Mutagenesis</span></span></p>
<p>Oncogenic transformation of fibroblasts from mouse embryo has been induced <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">in vitro</span></span> by fluorouracil, but the relationship between oncogenicity and mutagenicity is not clear.Â  Fluorouracil has been shown to be mutagenic to several <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span> typhimurium</span></span>, including TA 1535, TA 1537 and TA 1538, and to <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span></span>, although no evidence of mutagenicity was found with <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span> typhimurium</span></span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> TA 92, TA 98 and TA 100.Â  In addition, a positive effect was observed in the micronucleus test on bone marrow cells of the mouse, and fluorouracil at very high concentrations produced chromosomal breaks in hamster fibroblasts <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">in vitro</span></span>. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Impairment of Fertility</span></span></p>
<p>Fluorouracil has not been adequately studied in animals to permit an evaluation of its effects on fertility and general reproductive performance.Â  However, doses of 125 or 250 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally, have been shown to induce chromosomal aberrations and changes in chromosomal organization of spermatogonia in rats.Â  Spermatogonial differentiation was also inhibited by fluorouracil, resulting in transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4035976" conceptname="Sterility">infertility</span>.Â  However, in studies with a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span> of mouse which is sensitive to the induction of sperm head abnormalities after exposure to a range of chemical mutagens and carcinogens, fluorouracil did not produce any abnormalities at oral doses of up to 80 mg/kg/day.Â  In female rats, fluorouracil, administered intraperitoneally at weekly doses of 25 or 50 mg/kg for 3 weeks during the pre-ovulatory phase of oogenesis, significantly reduced the incidence of fertile matings, delayed the development of pre- and post-implantation embryos, increased the incidence of pre-implantation lethality and induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434153" conceptname="Congenital chromosomal disease">chromosomal anomalies</span> in these embryos.Â  In a limited study in rabbits, a single 25 mg/kg dose of fluorouracil or 5 daily doses of 5 mg/kg had no effect on ovulation, appeared not to affect implantation and had only a limited effect in producing zygote destruction.Â  Compounds such as fluorouracil, which interfere with DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, might be expected to have adverse effects on gametogenesis.</p>

<h2>Maintenance Therapy<br>
</h2>
<p class="First">In instances where toxicity has not been a problem, it is recommended that therapy be continued using either of the following schedules:</p>
<p>Â Â Â  1. Repeat dosage of first course every 30 days after the last day of the previous course of treatment.</p>
<p>Â Â Â  2. When toxic signs resulting from the initial course of therapy have subsided, administer a maintenance dosage of 10 to 15 mg/kg/week as a single dose.Â  Do not exceed 1 g per week.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>The patientâ€™s reaction to the previous course of therapy should be taken into account in determining the amount of the drug to be used, and the dosage should be adjusted accordingly.Â  Some patients have received from 9 to 45 courses of treatment during periods which ranged from 12 to 60 months.</p>
<p>Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should be considered.Â  Several guidelines on this subject have been published.<span class="Sup">2-7</span>Â  There is no general agreement that all of the procedures recommended in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate.</p>

<h2>Note</h2>
<p class="First">Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.Â  Although the Fluorouracil solution may discolor slightly during storage, the potency and safety are not adversely affected.Â  If a precipitate occurs due to exposure to low temperatures, resolubilize by heating to 140Â°F and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">shaking</span> vigorously; allow to cool to body temperature before using.</p>

<h1>DIRECTION FOR PROPER USE OF PHARMACY BULK PACKAGE<br>
</h1>
<p class="First">Pharmacy Bulk Packages are for use in a Pharmacy Admixture Service only in a vertical laminar flow hood.Â  They should be inserted into the ring sling (plastic hanging device) provided and suspended as a unit in the vertical laminar flow hood. Â The container closure should be penetrated only one time utilizing a suitable sterile dispensing set or transfer device which allows measured distribution of the contents. Â Swab vial stopper with an antiseptic solution. Â Insert the device/set into the vial using aseptic technique (see graphic illustration below).</p>
<p>Â <img alt="fluorouracil-picture" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=beb8c6c5-4b6e-4770-b6d4-718e33c7a2ff&amp;name=fluorouracil-injection-usp-pbp-figure-2-fluorouracil-picture.jpg"></p>
<p>Once the sterile dispensing set or transfer device has been inserted into the container, withdrawal of the contents should be accomplished without delay.Â  <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">However, if this is not possible, a maximum time of 4 hours from the initial entry may be allowed to complete fluid aliquoting/transferring operations.Â  The transferred drug solution should be used promptly. Â Discard the contents no later than 4 hours after initial closure puncture.</span></span></p>
