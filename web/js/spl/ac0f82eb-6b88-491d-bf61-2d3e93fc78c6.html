<h1><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</span></h1>
<p class="First">Oxycodone hydrochloride component:</p>
<p>Oxycodone hydrochloride is a semisynthetic opioid analgesic with multiple actions which involve the central nervous system and smooth muscle. The mechanism of action of oxycodone is not known but is thought to be related to its binding to opiate receptors in the central nervous system. In addition to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, opioids may produce sedation and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>.</p>
<p>Ibuprofen component:</p>
<p>Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent that possesses analgesic and antipyretic activities. Its mode of action, similar to other NSAIDs, is not completely understood, but is thought to be related to its inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity and prostaglandin synthesis. Ibuprofen is a peripherally acting analgesic. Ibuprofen does not have any known effects on opiate receptors.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="43682-4">
<a name="section-3.1"></a><p></p>
<h2><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics
</span></h2>
<p class="First">Absorption:</p>
<p>Oxycodone is rapidly absorbed after single dose administration of oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen tablets. Maximum concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of oxycodone, ranging from 9.8 ng/mL to 11.7 ng/mL, are obtained within 1.3 hr to 2.1 hr after administration of oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen. Repeated administration of oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen, every 6 hours, results in approximately 50 to 65% increase in C<span class="Sub">max</span>. In the presence of food, the bioavailability of oxycodone is slightly (25%) increased.</p>
<p>Ibuprofen is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen. C<span class="Sub">max</span> values range from 18.5 mcg/mL to 34.3 mcg/mL and are reached 1.6 hr to 3.1 hr after oral administration of oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen. Repeated administration of oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen every 6 hours does not result in any accumulation of ibuprofen. The bioavailability of ibuprofen is not altered in the presence of food.</p>
<p>Distribution:</p>
<p>Oxycodone binding to protein in serum is approximately 45%.</p>
<p>Ibuprofen is extensively bound to plasma proteins (99%).</p>
<p>Metabolism:</p>
<p>Oxycodone is metabolized in the liver by means of N-demethylation and O-demethylation, 6-ketoreduction and glucuronidation. The major circulating metabolite is noroxycodone, which possesses weak analgesic activity.</p>
<p>Oxymorphone, the end product of O-demethylation, has analgesic activity but is present in the plasma at low concentrations. Metabolism of oxycodone to oxymorphone occurs via CYP2D6.</p>
<p>Ibuprofen is present as a racemate and following absorption, it undergoes interconversion in the plasma from the R-isomer to the S-isomer.</p>
<p>Both the R- and S-isomers are metabolized to two primary metabolites: (+)-2-4'-(2-hydroxy-2-methyl-propyl) phenyl propionic acid and (+)-2-4'-(2-carboxypropyl) phenyl propionic acid, both of which circulate in the plasma at low levels relative to the parent.</p>
<p>Elimination:</p>
<p>Oxycodone is eliminated from the systemic circulation with half life (T<span class="Sub">1/2</span>) values ranging from 3.1 hr to 3.7 hr after single dose administration of oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen tablets. Urinary excretion of unchanged oxycodone amounts to approximately 4% of the administered oxycodone dose.</p>
<p>Ibuprofen is eliminated from the systemic circulation with half life (T<span class="Sub">1/2</span>) values ranging from 1.8 hr to 2.6 hr after single dose administration of oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen tablets. Urinary excretion of unchanged ibuprofen is minimal (less than 0.2% of administered ibuprofen dose).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Special Populations:</span></p>
<p>Gender: There are no gender effects on the pharmacokinetics of oxycodone or ibuprofen after administration of oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen tablets.</p>
<p>Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of oxycodone and ibuprofen after administration of oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen tablets have not been evaluated.</p>
<p>When either drug was administered alone, the pharmacokinetics of oxycodone and ibuprofen were similar in elderly subjects, compared to young healthy subjects.</p>
<p>Pediatrics: The pharmacokinetics of oxycodone and ibuprofen after administration of oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen tablets has not been evaluated in a pediatric population.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">CLINICAL STUDIES
</span></h1>
<p class="First">Oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen was investigated in three clinical studies. Two studies involving a total of 949 patients following dental surgery (removal of ipsilateral molars) and a third study of 456 patients following abdominal/pelvic surgery were conducted. In the three studies patients were administered a single dose of the oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen tablets, ibuprofen alone, oxycodone hydrochloride alone or placebo for acute, moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>.</p>
<p>In these single dose studies, oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen combination product produced greater efficacy than placebo and each of oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen tablets individual components as measured by the magnitude of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relief and the reduction in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> intensity through six hours.

<h2><span class="Bold">Cardiovascular Effects
</span></h2>
<p class="First">Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</p>
<p>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</p>
<p>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI events (see WARNINGS; Gastrointestinal</p>
<p>Effects - Risk of Ulceration, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">Bleeding</span>, and Perforation).</p>
<p>Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> (see <a href="#bf7df16b-de01-4f4d-a0f5-cc5ff2b3fe37">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>).</p>

</span></h2>
<p class="First">NSAIDs, including oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcers</span>, gross <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2 to 4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk.</p>
<p>NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcer</span> disease or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">gastrointestinal bleeding</span>.

Other factors that increase risk for GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.</p>
<p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions
</span></h2>
<p class="First">Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs (e.g., certain cardiovascular drugs and antidepressants), such blockade has not yet been shown to be of clinical significance with this agent. However, clinicians should be aware of this possible interaction.</p>
<p>Anticholinergics: The concurrent use of anticholinergics with oxycodone preparations may produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192357" conceptname="Paralytic ileus">paralytic ileus</span>.</p>
<p>CNS Depressants: Patients receiving narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with oxycodone may exhibit an additive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span>. Interactive effects resulting in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, profound sedation, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span> may result if these drugs are taken in combination with the usual dosage of oxycodone. When such combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced.</p>
<p>Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics: Agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol and buprenorphine) should be administered with caution to patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as oxycodone. In this situation, mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics may reduce the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span> of oxycodone and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients.</p>
<p>Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs): MAOIs have been reported to intensify the effects of at least one opioid drug causing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> and significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> of respiration or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>. The use of oxycodone is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.</p>
<p>Neuromuscular Blocking Agents: Oxycodone, as well as other opioid analgesics, may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>.</p>
<p>ACE-Inhibitors: Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors.</p>
<p>Aspirin: When oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen is administered with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen is not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however as with other products containing NSAIDs, concomitant administration of oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.</p>
<p>Diuretics: Ibuprofen has been shown to reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen the patient should be observed closely for signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> (see <a href="#bd2bf914-3e47-4263-9494-dd8faec8fde4">WARNINGS; Renal Effects</a>), as well as diuretic efficacy.</p>
<p>Lithium: Ibuprofen has been shown to produce an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium toxicity</span>.</p>
<p>Methotrexate: Ibuprofen, as well as other NSAIDs, has been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that ibuprofen could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen is administered concomitantly with methotrexate.</p>
<p>Warfarin: The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a greater risk of serious GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> than users of either drug alone.</p>

<h3>Teratogenic Effects</h3>
<p class="First">Pregnancy Category C prior to 30 weeks gestation; Category D starting at 30 weeks gestation</p>
<p>Starting at 30 weeks gestation, oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen, and other NSAIDS, should be avoided by pregnant women as premature closure of the ductus arteriosus in the fetus may occur. Oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman starting at 30 weeks gestation. If oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen, and other NSAIDS, are used during this time period in pregnancy, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Prior to 30 weeks gestation, oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus.</p>
<p>Animal studies to assess the potential effects of the combination of oxycodone and ibuprofen on embryo-fetal development were conducted in the rat and rabbit model.</p>
<p>Pregnant rats were treated by oral gavage with combination doses of oxycodone:ibuprofen mg/kg/day (0.25:20, 0.5:40, 1:80, or 2:160) on days 7 to16 of gestation. There was no evidence for developmental toxicity or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> at any dose, although maternal toxicity was noted at doses of 0.5:40 and above. The highest dose tested in the rat (2:160 mg/kg/day) is equivalent to the maximum recommended human daily dose (20:1600 mg/day) on a body surface area (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) basis. This dose was associated with maternal toxicity (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>, clinical signs, decreased BW).</p>
<p>Pregnant rabbits were treated by oral gavage with combination doses of oxycodone/ibuprofen (0.38:30, 0.75:60, 1.5:120 or 3:240 mg/kg/day) on gestation days 7 to19. Oxycodone/ibuprofen treatment was not teratogenic under the conditions of the assay. Maternal toxicity was noted at doses of 1.5:120 (reduced body weight and food consumption) and 3:240 mg/kg/day (mortality). The NOAEL for maternal toxicity, 0.75:60 mg/kg/day, is 0.75 fold the proposed maximum daily human dose based upon the body surface area. Developmental toxicity, as evidenced by delayed ossification and reduced fetal body weights, was noted at the highest dose, which is approximately 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, and is likely due to maternal toxicity. The fetal no adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 1.5:120 mg/kg/day is approximately 1.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p>
<p>In a pre- and postnatal development study conducted in rats, there was increased mortality of pups born to dams dose with 0.5:40 mg/kg/day oxycodone:ibuprofen and above which is equivalent to 0.25-times of the MRHD (20:1600 mg/day) on a body surface area (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) basis. There was an increase in stillborn F1 pups and decrease in mean pup weight in dams dosed with 1:80 mg/kg/day oxycodone:ibuprofen, which is 0.5-times the MRHD (20:1600 mg/day) on a body surface area (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) basis.</p>

Withdrawal symptoms and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> have been observed in neonates whose mothers were taking narcotic analgesics during pregnancy. Although adverse effects in the nursing infant have not been documented, withdrawal can occur in breast-feeding infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is discontinued. Because many drugs are excreted in human-milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span>
</span></h1>
<p class="First">Oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen tablets contain oxycodone, which is a mu-opioid agonist with an abuse liability similar to other opioid agonists and is a Schedule II controlled substance. Oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen tablets, and other opioids used in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, can be abused and are subject to criminal diversion.</p>
<p>Addiction is a primary, chronic, neurobiologic disease, with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations. It is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following: impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug addiction</span> is a treatable disease utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common.</p>
<p>“Drug seeking? behavior is very common in addicts and drug abusers. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated “loss? of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). “Doctor shopping? to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction.</p>
<p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> and tolerance. Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> usually assumes clinically significant dimensions only after several weeks of continued opioid use, although a mild degree of physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> may develop after a few days of opioid therapy. Tolerance, in which increasingly large doses are required in order to produce the same degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, is manifested initially by a shortened duration of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span>, and subsequently by decreases in the intensity of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>. The rate of development of tolerance varies among patients. Physicians should be aware that abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction and is characterized by misuse for non-medical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. Oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen tablets, like other opioids, may be diverted for non-medical use. Record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised.</p>
<p>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</p>

In severe cases <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> may occur.</p>
<p>The toxicity of ibuprofen <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> is dependent on the amount of drug ingested and the time elapsed since ingestion, although individual response may vary, necessitating individual evaluation of each case. Although uncommon, serious toxicity and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> have been reported in the medical literature with ibuprofen overdosage. The most frequently reported symptoms of ibuprofen <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4061577" conceptname="Lethargy">lethargy</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>.

<p><span class="Bold">Treatment</span></p>
<p>In the treatment of opioid overdosage, primary attention should be given to the re-establishment of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) should be employed in the management of circulatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4078925" conceptname="Pulmonary edema">pulmonary edema</span> accompanying <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, as indicated. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">Cardiac arrest</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span> may require cardiac massage or defibrillation. The narcotic antagonist naloxone hydrochloride is a specific antidote against <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, which may result from overdosage or unusual sensitivity to narcotics including oxycodone. An appropriate dose of naloxone hydrochloride should be administered intravenously with simultaneous efforts at respiratory resuscitation. Since the duration of action of oxycodone may exceed that of the naloxone, the patient should be kept under continuous surveillance and repeated doses of the antagonist should be administered as needed to maintain adequate respiration. Management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidosis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">gastrointestinal bleeding</span> may be necessary. In cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">acute overdose</span>, the stomach should be emptied through ipecac-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> or gastric lavage. Orally administered activated charcoal may help in reducing the absorption and reabsorption of ibuprofen. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">Emesis</span> is most effective if initiated within 30 minutes of ingestion. Induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> is not recommended in patients with impaired consciousness or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> greater than 400 mg/kg of the ibuprofen component in children because of the risk for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> and the potential for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span> of gastric contents.</p>
