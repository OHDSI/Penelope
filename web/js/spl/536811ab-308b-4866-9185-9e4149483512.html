<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Carbamazepine has demonstrated anticonvulsant properties in rats and mice with electrically and chemically induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>. It appears to act by reducing polysynaptic responses and blocking the post-tetanic potentiation. Carbamazepine greatly reduces or abolishes <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> induced by stimulation of the infraorbital nerve in cats and rats. It depresses thalamic potential and bulbar and polysynaptic reflexes, including the linguomandibular reflex in cats. Carbamazepine is chemically unrelated to other anticonvulsants or other drugs used to control the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="379801" conceptname="Trigeminal neuralgia">trigeminal neuralgia</span>. The mechanism of action remains unknown.</p>
<p>The principal metabolite of carbamazepine, carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, has anticonvulsant activity as demonstrated in several <span class="Bold">in vivo</span> animal models of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>. Though clinical activity for the epoxide has been postulated, the significance of its activity with respect to the safety and efficacy of carbamazepine has not been established. </p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">In clinical studies, carbamazepine suspension, conventional tablets, and carbamazepine extended-release tablets delivered equivalent amounts of drug to the systemic circulation. However, the suspension was absorbed somewhat faster, and the carbamazepine extended-release tablet slightly slower, than the conventional tablet. The bioavailability of the carbamazepine extended-release tablet was 89% compared to suspension. Following a b.i.d. dosage regimen, the suspension provides higher peak levels and lower trough levels than those obtained from the conventional tablet for the same dosage regimen. On the other hand, following a t.i.d. dosage regimen, carbamazepine suspension affords steady-state plasma levels comparable to carbamazepine tablets given b.i.d. when administered at the same total mg daily dose. Following a b.i.d. dosage regimen, carbamazepine extended-release tablets afford steady-state plasma levels comparable to conventional carbamazepine tablets given q.i.d., when administered at the same total mg daily dose. Carbamazepine in blood is 76% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma levels of carbamazepine are variable and may range from 0.5 to 25 mcg/mL, with no apparent relationship to the daily intake of the drug. Usual adult therapeutic levels are between 4 and 12 mcg/mL. In polytherapy, the concentration of carbamazepine and concomitant drugs may be increased or decreased during therapy, and drug effects may be altered (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_interactions_id_f50f05ce-b15d-4698-a25a-ec95720793e5">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</a></span>). Following chronic oral administration of suspension, plasma levels peak at approximately 1.5 hours compared to 4 to 5 hours after administration of conventional carbamazepine tablets, and 3 to 12 hours after administration of carbamazepine-extended-release tablets. The CSF/serum ratio is 0.22, similar to the 24% unbound carbamazepine in serum. Because carbamazepine induces its own metabolism, the half-life is also variable. Autoinduction is completed after 3 to 5 weeks of a fixed dosing regimen. Initial half-life values range from 25 to 65 hours, decreasing to 12 to 17 hours on repeated doses. Carbamazepine is metabolized in the liver. Cytochrome P450 3A4 was identified as the major isoform responsible for the formation of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide from carbamazepine. After oral administration of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-carbamazepine, 72% of the administered radioactivity was found in the urine and 28% in the feces. This urinary radioactivity was composed largely of hydroxylated and conjugated metabolites, with only 3% of unchanged carbamazepine.</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetic parameters of carbamazepine disposition are similar in children and in adults. However, there is a poor correlation between plasma concentrations of carbamazepine and carbamazepine dose in children. Carbamazepine is more rapidly metabolized to carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (a metabolite shown to be equipotent to carbamazepine as an anticonvulsant in animal screens) in the younger age groups than in adults. In children below the age of 15, there is an inverse relationship between CBZ-E/CBZ ratio and increasing age (in one report from 0.44 in children below the age of 1 year to 0.18 in children between 10 to 15 years of age).</p>
<p>The effects of race and gender on carbamazepine pharmacokinetics have not been systematically evaluated.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First">Patients with a history of adverse hematologic reaction to any drug may be particularly at risk.</p>
<p>Severe dermatologic reactions including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443754" conceptname="Lyell's toxic epidermal necrolysis, subepidermal type">toxic epidermal necrolysis</span> (Lyell s syndrome) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="141651" conceptname="Stevens-Johnson syndrome">Stevens-Johnson syndrome</span>, have been reported with carbamazepine. These reactions have been extremely rare. However, a few fatalities have been reported.</p>
<p>Carbamazepine has shown mild anticholinergic activity; therefore, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4011560" conceptname="Raised intraocular pressure">increased intraocular pressure</span> should be closely observed during therapy.</p>
<p>Because of the relationship of the drug to other tricyclic compounds, the possibility of activation of a latent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychosis</span> and, in elderly patients, of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span> should be borne in mind. </p>
<p>As with all antiepileptic drugs, carbamazepine should be withdrawn gradually to minimize the potential of increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> frequency. </p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42228-7">

<h2>Usage in Pregnancy</h2>
<p class="First">Carbamazepine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.</p>
<p>Epidemiological data suggest that there may be an association between the use of carbamazepine during pregnancy and congenital malformations, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4283381" conceptname="Spina bifida">spina bifida</span>. There have been reports in association with carbamazepine of other congenital anomalies and developmental disorders (e.g., craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations and anomalies involving various body systems). In treating or counseling women of childbearing potential, the prescribing physician will wish to weigh the benefits of therapy against the risks. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.</p>
<p>Retrospective case reviews suggest that, compared with monotherapy, there may be a higher prevalence of teratogenic effects associated with the use of anticonvulsants in combination therapy. Therefore, if therapy is to be continued, monotherapy may be preferable for pregnant women. </p>
<p>In humans, transplacental passage of carbamazepine is rapid (30 to 60 minutes), and the drug is accumulated in the fetal tissues, with higher levels found in liver and kidney than in brain and lung. </p>
<p>Carbamazepine has been shown to have adverse effects in reproduction studies in rats when given orally in dosages 10 to 25 times the maximum human daily dosage (MHDD) of 1200 mg on a mg/kg basis or 1.5 to 4 times the MHDD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. In rat teratology studies, 2 of 135 offspring showed kinked ribs at 250 mg/kg and 4 of 119 offspring at 650 mg/kg showed other anomalies (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135923" conceptname="Cleft palate">cleft palate</span>, 1; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134730" conceptname="Talipes">talipes</span>, 1; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434143" conceptname="Anophthalmos">anophthalmos</span>, 2). In reproduction studies in rats, nursing offspring demonstrated a lack of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span> and an unkempt appearance at a maternal dosage level of 200 mg/kg. </p>
<p>Antiepileptic drugs should not be discontinued abruptly in patients in whom the drug is administered to prevent major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> because of the strong possibility of precipitating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span> with attendant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxia</span> and threat to life. In individual cases where the severity and frequency of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> disorder are such that removal of medication does not pose a serious threat to the patient, discontinuation of the drug may be considered prior to and during pregnancy, although it cannot be said with any confidence that even minor <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> do not pose some hazard to the developing embryo or fetus. </p>
<p>Tests to detect defects using currently accepted procedures should be considered a part of routine prenatal care in childbearing women receiving carbamazepine. </p>
<p>There have been a few cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380533" conceptname="Convulsions in the newborn">neonatal seizures</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> associated with maternal carbamazepine and other concomitant anticonvulsant drug use.

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Before initiating therapy, a detailed history and physical examination should be made. </p>
<p>Carbamazepine should be used with caution in patients with a mixed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> disorder that includes atypical absence <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>, since in these patients carbamazepine has been associated with increased frequency of generalized <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_indications_id_251baa7c-560a-4936-abf9-4b3d2d953e52">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</a></span>). </p>
<p>Therapy should be prescribed only after critical benefit-to-risk appraisal in patients with a history of cardiac conduction disturbance; cardiac, hepatic or renal damage; adverse hematologic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reaction</span> to other drugs, including reactions to other anticonvulsants; or interrupted courses of therapy with carbamazepine.</p>
<p>Hepatic effects, ranging from slight elevations in liver enzymes to rare cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic failure</span> have been reported (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_adverse_effects_id_12d88eed-322a-47e4-9937-985fab02c78c">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_lab_tests_id_a443f503-3bbc-4d12-947f-b66bef18ad6d">PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests</a></span>). In some cases, hepatic effects may progress despite discontinuation of the drug. </p>
<p>Multi-organ <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span> occurring days to weeks or months after initiating treatment have been reported in rare cases (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_section_id_25c68acb-4cef-41b2-8603-6a302a9745b0">ADVERSE REACTIONS, Other</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_info_patients_id_a26024ba-6376-4758-bbe6-25b872372b07">PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients</a></span>). </p>
<p>Discontinuation of carbamezepine should be considered if any evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> develops.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">Hypersensitivity reactions</span> to carbamazepine have been reported in patients who previously experienced this reaction to anticonvulsants including phenytoin and phenobarbital.

If positive, caution should be used in prescribing carbamazepine.</p>
<p>Since a given dose of carbamazepine suspension will produce higher peak levels than the same dose given as the tablet, it is recommended that patients given the suspension be started on lower doses and increased slowly to avoid unwanted side effects (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_8e408c9e-cd30-4c25-bf7a-3caceb025811">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>

<p class="First">Patients should be made aware of the early toxic signs and symptoms of a potential hematologic problem, as well as dermatologic, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="26711" conceptname="Chronic pharyngitis">sore throat</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcers</span> in the mouth, easy <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441737" conceptname="Contusion">bruising</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315085" conceptname="Lymphadenopathy">lymphadenopathy</span> and petechial or purpuric <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">hemorrhage</span>, and in the case of liver reactions, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">anorexia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span>. The patient should be advised, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, the patient should be advised that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use.</p>
<p>Caution should be exercised if alcohol is taken in combination with carbamazepine therapy, due to a possible additive sedative effect.</p>
<p>Since <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> may occur, patients should be cautioned about the hazards of operating machinery or automobiles or engaging in other potentially dangerous tasks.</p>

<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">Complete pretreatment blood counts, including platelets and possibly reticulocytes and serum iron, should be obtained as a baseline. If a patient in the course of treatment exhibits low or decreased white blood cell or platelet counts, the patient should be monitored closely. Discontinuation of the drug should be considered if any evidence of significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4145241" conceptname="Bone marrow depression">bone marrow depression</span> develops.</p>
<p>Baseline and periodic evaluations of liver function, particularly in patients with a history of liver disease, must be performed during treatment with this drug since <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver damage</span> may occur (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_precautions_general_id_3380516d-495c-4349-9312-f6d2e20ac8ff">PRECAUTIONS, General</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_adverse_effects_id_12d88eed-322a-47e4-9937-985fab02c78c">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span>). Carbamazepine should be discontinued, based on clinical judgment, if indicated by newly occurring or worsening clinical or laboratory evidence of liver dysfunction or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">hepatic damage</span>, or in the case of active liver disease.</p>
<p>Baseline and periodic eye examinations, including slit-lamp, funduscopy and tonometry are recommended, since many phenothiazines and related drugs have been shown to cause eye changes.</p>
<p>Baseline and periodic complete urinalysis and BUN determinations are recommended for patients treated with this agent because of observed renal dysfunction.</p>
<p>Monitoring of blood levels (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_clinical_pharmacology_id_ff236e99-8d32-426c-95fa-eabffde5f260">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span>) has increased the efficacy and safety of anticonvulsants. This monitoring may be particularly useful in cases of dramatic increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> frequency and for verification of compliance. In addition, measurement of drug serum levels may aid in determining the cause of toxicity when more than one medication is being used.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4261836" conceptname="Thyroid panel">Thyroid function tests</span> have been reported to show decreased values with carbamazepine administered alone.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">There has been a report of a patient who passed an orange rubbery precipitate in his stool the day after ingesting carbamazepine suspension immediately followed by Thorazine<span class="Sup">®</span> (chlorpromazine hydrochloride) solution. Subsequent testing has shown that mixing carbamazepine suspension and chlorpromazine solution (both generic and brand name) as well as carbamazepine suspension and liquid Mellaril<span class="Sup">®</span> (thioridizine) resulted in the occurrence of this precipitate. Because the extent to which this occurs with other liquid medications is not known, carbamazepine suspension should not be administered simultaneously with other liquid medicinal agents or diluents. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_8e408c9e-cd30-4c25-bf7a-3caceb025811">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>
<p>Clinically meaningful drug interactions have occurred with concomitant medications and include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>

<h3>Agents That May Affect Carbamazepine Plasma Levels</h3>
<p class="First">CYP 3A4 inhibitors inhibit carbamazepine metabolism and can thus increase plasma carbamazepine levels. Drugs that have been shown, or would be expected, to increase plasma carbamazepine levels include:</p>
<dl>

<h3>Effect of Carbamazepine on Plasma Levels of Concomitant Agents</h3>
<p class="First">Increased levels: clomipramine HCl, phenytoin, primidone.</p>
<p>Carbamazepine induces hepatic CYP activity. Carbamazepine causes, or would be expected to cause, decreased levels of the following:</p>
<p>acetaminophen, alprazolam, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g., felodipine), cyclosporine, corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone, dexamethasone), clonazepam, clozapine, dicumarol, doxycycline, ethosuximide, haloperidol, itraconazole, lamotrigine, levothyroxine, methadone, methsuximide, midazolam, oral and other hormonal contraceptives, oxcarbazepine, phensuximide, phenytoin, praziquantel, protease inhibitors, risperidone, theophylline, tiagabine, topiramate, tramadol, tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., imipramine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline), valproate, warfarin, ziprasidone, zonisamide.</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of carbamazepine and lithium may increase the risk of neurotoxic side effects.</p>
<p>Alterations of thyroid function have been reported in combination therapy with other anticonvulsant medications.</p>
<p>Concomitant use of carbamazepine with hormonal contraceptive products (e.g. oral, and levonorgestrel subdermal implant contraceptives) may render the contraceptives less effective because the plasma concentrations of the hormones may be decreased. Breakthrough <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> and unintended pregnancies have been reported. Alternative or back-up methods of contraception should be considered.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Carbamazepine, when administered to Sprague-Dawley rats for two years in the diet at doses of 25, 75 and 250 mg/kg/day, resulted in a dose-related increase in the incidence of hepatocellular tumors in females and of benign interstitial cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> in the testes of males.</p>
<p>Carbamazepine must, therefore, be considered to be carcinogenic in Sprague-Dawley rats. Bacterial and mammalian mutagenicity studies using carbamazepine produced negative results. The significance of these findings relative to the use of carbamazepine in humans is, at present, unknown.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Carbamazepine and its epoxide metabolite are transferred to breast milk. The ratio of the concentration in breast milk to that in maternal plasma is about 0.4 for carbamazepine and about 0.5 for the epoxide. The estimated doses given to the newborn during breast feeding are in the range of 2 to 5 mg daily for carbamazepine and 1 to 2 mg daily for the epoxide.</p>
<p>Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from carbamazepine, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Substantial evidence of carbamazepine s effectiveness for use in the management of children with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_indications_id_251baa7c-560a-4936-abf9-4b3d2d953e52">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</a></span> for specific <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> types) is derived from clinical investigations performed in adults and from studies in several <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> systems which support the conclusion that (1) the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> propagation are essentially identical in adults and children, and (2) the mechanism of action of carbamazepine in treating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> is essentially identical in adults and children.</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, this information supports a conclusion that the generally accepted therapeutic range of total carbamazepine in plasma (i.e., 4 to 12 mcg/mL) is the same in children and adults.</p>
<p>The evidence assembled was primarily obtained from short-term use of carbamazepine. The safety of carbamazepine in children has been systematically studied up to 6 months. No longer-term data from clinical trials is available.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">If adverse reactions are of such severity that the drug must be discontinued, the physician must be aware that abrupt discontinuation of any anticonvulsant drug in a responsive epileptic patient may lead to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> or even <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span> with its life-threatening hazards.</p>

<p><span class="Italics">Elimination of the Drug:</span> Induction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">(see <a href="#id_4c1729c3-a132-4fb2-ad22-2b5cae0cfaa1">table</a> below)</p>
<p>Carbamazepine suspension in combination with liquid chlorpromazine or thioridazine results in precipitate formation, and, in the case of chlorpromazine, there has been a report of a patient passing an orange rubbery precipitate in the stool following coadministration of the two drugs. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_interactions_id_f50f05ce-b15d-4698-a25a-ec95720793e5">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</a>.</span>) Because the extent to which this occurs with other liquid medications is not known, carbamazepine suspension should not be administered simultaneously with other liquid medications or diluents. </p>
<p>Monitoring of blood levels has increased the efficacy and safety of anticonvulsants (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_lab_tests_id_a443f503-3bbc-4d12-947f-b66bef18ad6d">PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests</a></span>). Dosage should be adjusted to the needs of the individual patient. A low initial daily dosage with a gradual increase is advised. As soon as adequate control is achieved, the dosage may be reduced very gradually to the minimum effective level. Medication should be taken with meals.</p>
<p>Since a given dose of carbamazepine suspension will produce higher peak levels than the same dose given as the tablet, it is recommended to start with low doses (children 6 to 12 years; 1/2 teaspoon q.i.d.) and to increase slowly to avoid unwanted side effects.</p>
<p>Conversion of patients from oral carbamazepine tablets to carbamazepine suspension: Patients should be converted by administering the same number of mg per day in smaller, more frequent doses (i.e., b.i.d. tablets to t.i.d. suspension). </p>
