<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Comparisons of buprenorphine with full agonists such as methadone and hydromorphone suggest that sublingual buprenorphine produces typical opioid agonist effects which are limited by a ceiling effect. </p>
<p>In non-dependent subjects, acute sublingual doses of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets produced opioid agonist effects, which reached a maximum between doses of 8 mg and 16 mg of buprenorphine. The effects of 16 mg buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets were similar to those produced by 16 mg buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets (buprenorphine alone).</p>
<p>Opioid agonist ceiling effects were also observed in a double-blind, parallel group, dose ranging comparison of single doses of buprenorphine sublingual solution (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg), placebo, and a full agonist control at various doses. The treatments were given in ascending dose order at intervals of at least one week to 16 opioid-experienced, non-dependent subjects. Both drugs produced typical opioid agonist effects. For all the measures for which the drugs produced an effect, buprenorphine produced a dose-related response but, in each case, there was a dose that produced no further effect. In contrast, the highest dose of the full agonist control always produced the greatest effects. Agonist objective rating scores remained elevated for the higher doses of buprenorphine (8 to 32 mg) longer than for the lower doses and did not return to baseline until 48 hours after drug administrations. The onset of effects appeared more rapidly with buprenorphine than with the full agonist control, with most doses nearing peak effect after 100 minutes for buprenorphine compared to 150 minutes for the full agonist control.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buprenorphine in intravenous (2 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg, 12 mg and 16 mg) and sublingual (12 mg) doses has been administered to non-dependent subjects to examine cardiovascular, respiratory and subjective effects at doses comparable to those used for treatment of opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>. Compared with placebo, there were no statistically significant differences among any of the treatment conditions for blood pressure, heart rate, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4313591" conceptname="Respiratory rate">respiratory rate</span>, O<span class="Sub">2</span> saturation or skin temperature across time. Systolic BP was higher in the 8 mg group than placebo (3 hour AUC values). Minimum and maximum effects were similar across all treatments. Subjects remained responsive to low voice and responded to computer prompts. Some subjects showed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, but no other changes were observed. </p>
<p>The respiratory effects of sublingual buprenorphine were compared with the effects of methadone in a double-blind, parallel group, dose ranging comparison of single doses of buprenorphine sublingual solution (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg) and oral methadone (15, 30, 45, or 60 mg) in non-dependent, opioid-experienced volunteers. In this study, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312603" conceptname="Hypoventilation">hypoventilation</span> not requiring medical intervention was reported more frequently after buprenorphine doses of 4 mg and higher than after methadone. Both drugs decreased O<span class="Sub">2</span> saturation to the same degree.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Physiologic and subjective effects following acute sublingual administration of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets and buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets were similar at equivalent dose levels of buprenorphine. Naloxone, in the buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets formulation, had no clinically significant effect when administered by the sublingual route, although blood levels of the drug were measurable. </p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Plasma levels of buprenorphine increased with the sublingual dose of buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets and buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets, and plasma levels of naloxone increased with the sublingual dose of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets (Table 1). There was a wide inter-patient variability in the sublingual absorption of buprenorphine and naloxone, but within subjects the variability was low. Both C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of buprenorphine increased in a linear fashion with the increase in dose (in the range of 4 to 16 mg), although the increase was not directly dose-proportional. </p>
<p>Naloxone did not affect the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and both buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets and buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets deliver similar plasma concentrations of buprenorphine. The levels of naloxone were too low to assess dose-proportionality. At the three naloxone doses of 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg, levels above the limit of quantitation (0.05 ng/mL) were not detected beyond 2 hours in seven of eight subjects. In one individual, at the 4 mg dose, the last measurable concentration was at 8 hours. Within each subject (for most of the subjects), across the doses there was a trend toward an increase in naloxone concentrations with increase in dose. Mean peak naloxone levels ranged from 0.11 to 0.28 ng/mL in the dose range of 1 to 4 mg.</p>

<p>Buprenorphine is approximately 96% protein bound, primarily to alpha and beta globulin. </p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buprenorphine undergoes both N-dealkylation to norbuprenorphine and glucuronidation. The N-dealkylation pathway is mediated by cytochrome P-450 3A4 isozyme. Norbuprenorphine, an active metabolite, can further undergo glucuronidation. </p>

<p>A <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> balance study of buprenorphine showed complete recovery of radiolabel in urine (30%) and feces (69%) collected up to 11 days after dosing. Almost all of the dose was accounted for in terms of buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine, and two unidentified buprenorphine metabolites. In urine, most of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine was conjugated (buprenorphine, 1% free and 9.4% conjugated; norbuprenorphine, 2.7% free and 11% conjugated). In feces, almost all of the buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine were free (buprenorphine, 33% free and 5% conjugated; norbuprenorphine, 21% free and 2% conjugated). </p>

Subjects receiving buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets should be closely monitored and may require dose-reduction if inhibitors of CYP 3A4 such as azole antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin) and HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir, indinavir and saquinavir) are co-administered. The interaction of buprenorphine with CYP 3A4 inducers has not been investigated; therefore it is recommended that patients receiving buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets should be closely monitored if inducers of CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin) are co-administered (SEE<a href="#WARNINGS"> WARNINGS</a>). </p>

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Clinical data on the safety and efficacy of buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets are derived from studies of buprenorphine sublingual tablet formulations, with and without naloxone, and from studies of sublingual administration of a more bioavailable ethanolic solution of buprenorphine. </p>
<p>Buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets have been studied in 575 patients, buprenorphine HCl tablets in 1834 patients and buprenorphine sublingual solutions in 2470 patients. A total of 1270 females have received buprenorphine in clinical trials. Dosing recommendations are based on data from one trial of both tablet formulations and two trials of the ethanolic solution. All trials used buprenorphine in conjunction with psychosocial counseling as part of a comprehensive addiction treatment program. There have been no clinical studies conducted to assess the efficacy of buprenorphine as the only component of treatment. </p>
<p>In a double blind placebo- and active controlled study, 326 heroin-addicted subjects were randomly assigned to either 16 mg buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets per day, 16 mg buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets per day or placebo tablets. For subjects randomized to either active treatment, dosing began with one 8 mg tablet of buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablet on Day 1, followed by 16 mg (two 8 mg tablets) of buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets on Day 2. On Day 3, those randomized to receive buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets were switched to the combination tablet. Subjects randomized to placebo received one placebo tablet on Day 1 and two placebo tablets per day thereafter for four weeks. Subjects were seen daily in the clinic (Monday through Friday) for dosing and efficacy assessments. Take-home doses were provided for weekends. Subjects were instructed to hold the medication under the tongue for approximately 5 to 10 minutes until completely dissolved. Subjects received one hour of individual counseling per week and a single session of HIV education. The primary study comparison was to assess the efficacy of buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets and buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets individually against placebo. The percentage of thrice-weekly urine samples that were negative for non-study opioids was statistically higher for both buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets and buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets, than for placebo. </p>
<p>In a double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study comparing buprenorphine ethanolic solution to a full agonist active control, 162 subjects were randomized to receive the ethanolic sublingual solution of buprenorphine at 8 mg/day (a dose which is roughly comparable to a dose of 12 mg/day of buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets or buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets), or two relatively low doses of active control, one of which was low enough to serve as an alternative to placebo, during a 3 to 10-day induction phase, a 16-week maintenance phase and a 7-week detoxification phase. Buprenorphine was titrated to maintenance dose by Day 3; active control doses were titrated more gradually. </p>
<p>Maintenance dosing continued through Week 17, and then medications were tapered by approximately 20 to 30% per week over Weeks 18 to 24, with placebo dosing for the last two weeks. Subjects received individual and/or group counseling weekly. </p>
<p>Based on retention in treatment and the percentage of thrice-weekly urine samples negative for non-study opioids, buprenorphine was more effective than the low dose of the control, in keeping heroin addicts in treatment and in reducing their use of opioids while in treatment. The effectiveness of buprenorphine, 8 mg per day was similar to that of the moderate active control dose, but equivalence was not demonstrated.</p>
<p>In a dose-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, 16-week study, 731 subjects were randomized to receive one of four doses of buprenorphine ethanolic solution. Buprenorphine was titrated to maintenance doses over 1 to 4 days (Table 2) and continued for 16 weeks. Subjects received at least one session of AIDS education and additional counseling ranging from one hour per month to one hour per week, depending on site. </p>

<p>Based on retention in treatment and the percentage of thrice-weekly urine samples negative for non-study opioids, the three highest tested doses were superior to the 1 mg dose. Therefore, this study showed that a range of buprenorphine doses may be effective. The 1 mg dose of buprenorphine sublingual solution can be considered to be somewhat lower than a 2 mg tablet dose. The other doses used in the study encompass a range of tablet doses from approximately 6 mg to approximately 24 mg. </p>

Measurements of liver function tests prior to initiation of treatment is recommended to establish a baseline. Periodic monitoring of liver function tests during treatment is also recommended. A biological and etiological evaluation is recommended when a hepatic event is suspected. Depending on the case, the drug should be carefully discontinued to prevent withdrawal symptoms and a return to illicit drug use, and strict monitoring of the patient should be initiated. </p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets should be administered with caution in elderly or debilitated patients and those with severe impairment of hepatic, pulmonary, or renal function; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4182596" conceptname="Myxedema">myxedema</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140673" conceptname="Hypothyroidism">hypothyroidism</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="193984" conceptname="Adrenal hypofunction">adrenal cortical insufficiency</span> (e.g., Addison's disease); <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>; toxic psychoses; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198803" conceptname="Benign prostatic hyperplasia">prostatic hypertrophy</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="195590" conceptname="Urethral stricture">urethral stricture</span>; acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218106" conceptname="Alcoholism">alcoholism</span>; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377830" conceptname="Alcohol withdrawal delirium">delirium tremens</span>; or kyphoscoliosis. </p>
<p>The effect of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> on the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine is unknown. Since buprenorphine is extensively metabolized, the plasma levels will be expected to be higher in patients with moderate and severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>. Therefore, dosage should be adjusted and patients should be watched for symptoms of precipitated opioid withdrawal.</p>
<p>Buprenorphine has been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure, as do other opioids, and thus should be administered with caution to patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract. </p>
<p>As with other mu-opioid receptor agonists, the administration of buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions. </p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buprenorphine is metabolized to norbuprenorphine by cytochrome CYP 3A4. Because CYP 3A4 inhibitors may increase plasma concentrations of buprenorphine, patients already on CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole), macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), and HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, indinavir and saquinavir) should have their dose of buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets adjusted.</p>
<p>Based on anecdotal reports, there may be an interaction between buprenorphine and benzodiazepines. There have been a number of reports in the post-marketing experience of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> associated with the concomitant intravenous misuse of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines by addicts. In many of these cases, buprenorphine was misused by self-injection of crushed buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets. Buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets should be prescribed with caution to patients on benzodiazepines or other drugs that act on the central nervous system, regardless of whether these drugs are taken on the advice of a physician or are taken as drugs of abuse. Patients should be warned of the potential danger of the intravenous self-administration of benzodiazepines while under treatment with buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Patients should inform their family members that, in the event of emergency, the treating physician or emergency room staff should be informed that the patient is physically dependent on narcotics and that the patient is being treated with buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets.</p>
<p>Patients should be cautioned that a serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> may occur if benzodiazepines, sedatives, tranquilizers, antidepressants, or alcohol are taken at the same time as buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets. </p>
<p>Buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery, especially during drug induction and dose adjustment. Patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that buprenorphine therapy does not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities. Like other opioids, buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets may produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span> in ambulatory patients.</p>
<p>Patients should consult their physician if other prescription medications are currently being used or are prescribed for future use.</p>
<p>

<p>Carcinogenicity studies of buprenorphine were conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats and CD-1 mice. Buprenorphine was administered in the diet to rats at doses of 0.6, 5.5, and 56 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure was approximately 0.4, 3 and 35 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) for 27 months. Statistically significant dose-related increases in testicular interstitial (Leydig's) cell tumors occurred, according to the trend test adjusted for survival. Pair-wise comparison of the high dose against control failed to show statistical significance. In an 86-week study in CD-1 mice, buprenorphine was not carcinogenic at dietary doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure was approximately 30 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). </p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buprenorphine was studied in a series of tests utilizing gene, chromosome, and DNA interactions in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. Results were negative in yeast (<span class="Italics">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>) for recombinant, gene convertant, or forward mutations; negative in<span class="Italics"> Bacillus subtilis </span>"rec" assay, negative for clastogenicity in CHO cells, Chinese hamster bone marrow and spermatogonia cells, and negative in the mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> L5178Y assay. Results were equivocal in the Ames test: negative in studies in two laboratories, but positive for frame shift mutation at a high dose (5 mg/plate) in a third study. Results were positive in the Green-Tweets (<span class="Italics">E. coli</span>) survival test, positive in a DNA synthesis inhibition (DSI) test with testicular tissue from mice, for both<span class="Italics"> in vivo </span>and<span class="Italics"> in vitro </span>incorporation of [<span class="Sup">3</span>H]thymidine, and positive in unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) test using testicular cells from mice. </p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Reproduction studies of buprenorphine in rats demonstrated no evidence of impaired fertility at daily oral doses up to 80 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure was approximately 50 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) or up to 5 mg/kg/day<span class="Italics"> im </span>or<span class="Italics"> sc </span>(estimated exposure was approximately 3 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). </p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buprenorphine was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits after<span class="Italics"> im </span>or<span class="Italics"> sc </span>doses up to 5 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure was approximately 3 and 6 times, respectively, the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis), after<span class="Italics"> iv </span>doses up to 0.8 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure was approximately 0.5 times and equal to, respectively, the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis), or after oral doses up to 160 mg/kg/day in rats (estimated exposure was approximately 95 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) and 25 mg/kg/day in rabbits (estimated exposure was approximately 30 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). Significant increases in skeletal abnormalities (e.g., extra thoracic vertebra or thoraco-lumbar ribs) were noted in rats after<span class="Italics"> sc </span>administration of 1 mg/kg/day and up (estimated exposure was approximately 0.6 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis), but were not observed at oral doses up to 160 mg/kg/day. Increases in skeletal abnormalities in rabbits after<span class="Italics"> im </span>administration of 5 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure was approximately 6 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) or oral administration of 1 mg/kg/day or greater (estimated exposure was approximately equal to the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) were not statistically significant.</p>
<p>In rabbits, buprenorphine produced statistically significant pre-implantation losses at oral doses of 1 mg/kg/day or greater and post-implantation losses that were statistically significant at<span class="Italics"> iv </span>doses of 0.2 mg/kg/day or greater (estimated exposure was approximately 0.3 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). </p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets in pregnant women. Buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dystocia was noted in pregnant rats treated<span class="Italics"> im </span>with buprenorphine 5 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). Both fertility and peri- and postnatal development studies with buprenorphine in rats indicated increases in neonatal mortality after oral doses of 0.8 mg/kg/day and up (approximately 0.5 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis), after<span class="Italics"> im </span>doses of 0.5 mg/kg/day and up (approximately 0.3 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis), and after<span class="Italics"> sc </span>doses of 0.1 mg/kg/day and up (approximately 0.06 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). Delays in the occurrence of righting reflex and startle response were noted in rat pups at an oral dose of 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 50 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). </p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Neonatal withdrawal has been reported in the infants of women treated with buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets during pregnancy. From post-marketing reports, the time to onset of neonatal withdrawal symptoms ranged from Day 1 to Day 8 of life with most occurring on Day 1. Adverse events associated with neonatal withdrawal syndrome included <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208994" conceptname="Increased muscle tone">hypertonia</span>, neonatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span>, neonatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441553" conceptname="Myoclonus">myoclonus</span>. There have been rare reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> and in one case, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span> were also reported.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>An apparent lack of milk production during general reproduction studies with buprenorphine in rats caused decreased viability and lactation indices. Use of high doses of sublingual buprenorphine in pregnant women showed that buprenorphine passes into the mother's milk. Breast-feeding is therefore not advised in mothers treated with buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets is not recommended for use in pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness of buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets in patients below the age of 16 have not been established. </p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>The safety of buprenorphine sublingual tablets has been evaluated in clinical trials using buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets or buprenorphine sublingual solutions, and supported by other trials in 497 opioid-dependent subjects treated by buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets. In total, safety data are available from 3214 opioid-dependent subjects exposed to buprenorphine at doses in the range used in treatment of opioid addiction. </p>
<p>Few differences in adverse event profile were noted between buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets and buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets or buprenorphine administered as a sublingual solution. </p>
<p>In a comparative study, adverse event profiles were similar for subjects treated with 16 mg buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets or 16 mg buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets. The following adverse events were reported to occur by at least 5% of patients in a 4-week study (Table 3).</p>

<h1>DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets is controlled as a Schedule III narcotic under the Controlled Substances Act. </p>
<p>Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and chronic administration produces <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> of the opioid type, characterized by moderate withdrawal upon abrupt discontinuation or rapid taper. The withdrawal syndrome is milder than seen with full agonists, and may be delayed in onset (SEE<a href="#WARNINGS"> WARNINGS</a>). </p>
<p>Neonatal withdrawal has been reported in the infants of women treated with buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets during pregnancy (See<a href="#PRECAUTIONS"> PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>

<p></p>
<p>The respiratory and cardiac status of the patient should be monitored carefully. In the event of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> of respiratory or cardiac function, primary attention should be given to the re-establishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Oxygen, intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and other supportive measures should be employed as indicated. </p>
<p>IN THE CASE OF <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">OVERDOSE</span>, THE PRIMARY MANAGEMENT SHOULD BE THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF ADEQUATE VENTILATION WITH MECHANICAL ASSISTANCE OF RESPIRATION, IF REQUIRED. </p>
<p>High doses of naloxone hydrochloride, 10 to 35 mg/70 kg may be of limited value in the management of buprenorphine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. Doxapram (a respiratory stimulant) also has been used.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets is administered sublingually as a single daily dose in the range of 12 to 16 mg/day. Buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets contains no naloxone and is preferred for use during induction. Following induction, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets, due to the presence of naloxone, is preferred when clinical use includes unsupervised administration. The use of buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets for unsupervised administration should be limited to those patients who cannot tolerate buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets, for example those patients who have been shown to be hypersensitive to naloxone.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets should be placed under the tongue until they are dissolved. For doses requiring the use of more than two tablets, patients are advised to either place all the tablets at once or alternatively (if they cannot fit in more than two tablets comfortably) place two tablets at a time under the tongue. Either way, the patients should continue to hold the tablets under the tongue until they dissolve; swallowing the tablets reduces the bioavailability of the drug. To ensure consistency in bioavailability, patients should follow the same manner of dosing with continued use of the product. </p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Prior to induction, consideration should be given to the type of opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> (i.e., long- or short-acting opioid), the time since last opioid use, and the degree or level of opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>. To avoid precipitating withdrawal, induction with buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets should be undertaken when objective and clear signs of withdrawal are evident. </p>
<p>In a one-month study of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets induction was conducted with buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets. Patients received 8 mg of buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets on Day 1 and 16 mg buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets on Day 2. From Day 3 onward, patients received buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets at the same buprenorphine dose as Day 2. Induction in the studies of buprenorphine solution was accomplished over 3 to 4 days, depending on the target dose.</p>
<p>In some studies, gradual induction over several days led to a high rate of drop-out of buprenorphine patients during the induction period. Therefore it is recommended that an adequate maintenance dose, titrated to clinical effectiveness, should be achieved as rapidly as possible to prevent undue opioid withdrawal symptoms. </p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>At treatment initiation, the dose of buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets should be administered at least 4 hours after the patient last used opioids or preferably when early signs of opioid withdrawal appear. </p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>There is little controlled experience with the transfer of methadone-maintained patients to buprenorphine. Available evidence suggests that withdrawal symptoms are possible during induction to buprenorphine treatment. Withdrawal appears more likely in patients maintained on higher doses of methadone (&gt;30 mg) and when the first buprenorphine dose is administered shortly after the last methadone dose. </p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets is the preferred medication for maintenance treatment due to the presence of naloxone in the formulation. </p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The recommended target dose of buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets is 16 mg/day. Clinical studies have shown that 16 mg of buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets is a clinically effective dose compared with placebo and indicate that doses as low as 12 mg may be effective in some patients. The dosage of buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets should be progressively adjusted in increments / decrements of 2 mg or 4 mg to a level that holds the patient in treatment and suppresses opioid withdrawal effects. This is likely to be in the range of 4 to 24 mg/day depending on the individual. </p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The decision to discontinue therapy with buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets after a period of maintenance or brief stabilization should be made as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. Both gradual and abrupt discontinuation have been used, but no controlled trials have been undertaken to determine the best method of dose taper at the end of treatment. </p>

<p><span class="Bold">buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets (CIII)</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">What is buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets? </span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets </span>is indicated for the treatment of opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>.<span class="Bold"> Buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets </span>contains buprenorphine (a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and an antagonist at the kappa-opioid receptor). </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Why is it important for all pharmacists to learn about buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets? </span></p>
<p>Pharmacists play a role in the delivery of opiate addiction treatment.  Buprenorphine HCl is the first medication approved for office-based treatment of opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> under the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug Addiction</span> Treatment Act of 2000 (DATA).  Prior to the passage of this law, it was illegal for a doctor to prescribe narcotic drugs for the treatment of narcotic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>.  Under this law, opiate addiction treatment drugs under Schedule II are confined to use in the clinic setting.  Less tightly controlled drugs (Schedules III-V) may be<span class="Italics"> prescribed </span>for opiate addiction treatment by specially qualified doctors who treat patients in their private offices.  </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Why are there two formulations? </span></p>
<p>Buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets are the preferred medication for maintenance treatment due to the presence of naloxone in the formulation, which is intended to deter intravenous abuse by persons dependent on other opiates.<span class="Bold">  Buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets, </span>which do not contain naloxone, may be better tolerated by patients in the first several days of treatment and is generally preferred for induction.  "Induction" refers to the initial period of treatment, during which time the patient should receive medication under the doctor's supervision in the office.  Patients or their family members may need to come and pick up induction doses each day for the first several days of treatment (or you may be asked to arrange delivery to the doctor's office, if your pharmacy provides this service).  Therefore, while you may see prescriptions for small amounts of<span class="Bold"> burprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets </span>presented for induction doses, you should expect the majority of prescriptions to be for buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets.<span class="Bold">  Buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets </span>are controlled as Schedule III narcotics under the Controlled Substances Act.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">How is it supplied? </span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets </span>is supplied as round white tablets in 2 dosage strengths:  </p>
<p>2mg buprenorphine with "2" debossed on one side and a dart "→" debossed on the other side</p>
<p>and 8mg buprenorphine with "8" debossed on one side and a dart "→" debossed on the other side.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">I've heard that buprenorphine is safer than methadone.  Can these drugs be dangerous?  </span></p>
<p>Significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> has been associated with buprenorphine, particularly when administered intravenously.  A number of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> have occurred when addicts have intravenously misused buprenorphine, usually with benzodiazepines concomitantly.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Deaths</span> have also been reported in association with concomitant administration of buprenorphine and other depressants such as alcohol or other opioids. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Does buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>? </span></p>
<p>Chronic administration of<span class="Bold"> buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets </span>produces <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> of the opiate type, characterized by withdrawal upon abrupt discontinuation or rapid taper.  The withdrawal syndrome is milder than seen with full agonists, and may be delayed in onset. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Be sure to read the full Prescribing Information for complete Warnings &amp; Precautions.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">What other information should I relay to patients? </span></p>
<p>It is important that you make sure patients understand their physicians' instructions, and that you answer any questions they may have.</p>
<p>When counseling patients, be sure to discuss any relevant precautions as listed in the Prescribing Information, including but not limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patients should inform their family members that, in the event of emergency, the treating physician or emergency room staff should be informed that the patient is physically dependent on opioids and that the patient is being treated with<span class="Bold"> buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets.</span>
</li>
<li>Patients should be cautioned that a serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> may occur if benzodiazepines, sedatives, tranquilizers, antidepressants, or alcohol are taken at the same time as<span class="Bold"> buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets.</span>
</li>
<li>Patients should be cautioned that<span class="Bold"> buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets </span>may impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery.  Patients should be cautioned not to drive or operate complex machinery until they know how<span class="Bold"> buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets </span>affects their ability to function in these circumstances, such as driving a car. </li>
<li>Patients should consult their physician if other prescription medications are currently being used or are prescribed for future use</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Bold">What are the possible side effects of buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets?  </span></p>
<p>The most common adverse events reported in clinical trials with<span class="Bold"> buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets </span>were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, withdrawal syndrome, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134736" conceptname="Backache">back pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">constipation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">asthenia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4320791" conceptname="Rhinitis">rhinitis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">What is the role of the pharmacist in ensuring safe use of buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets? </span></p>
<p>As a pharmacist, you will play an important role in ensuring that<span class="Bold"> buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets </span>is used safely and appropriately.  Each time you fill a prescription for<span class="Bold"> buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets, </span>make sure to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Verify that the prescriptions you receive are from physicians who are in compliance with the provisions of the DATA (see Section:<a href="#who"> who is qualified to prescribe</a><span class="Bold"><a href="#who"> buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets</a></span>). </li>
<li>Remind patients who are picking up induction doses to return as directed to the doctor's office so that they can be supervised while taking the medication.</li>
<li>Be vigilant in detecting fraudulent prescriptions or simultaneous prescriptions for the same patient from multiple suppliers.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="who"></a><span class="Bold">Who is qualified to prescribe buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets? </span></p>
<p>The DATA limits office-based use of buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets to physicians who meet special training criteria and can provide appropriate services.  To be qualified, physicians must: </p>
<ul>
<li>Meet one or more of the following training requirements: <ul>
<li>hold a subspecialty board certification in addiction psychiatry from the American Board of Medical Specialties,</li>
<li>hold a subspecialty board certification in Addiction Medicine from the American Osteopathic Association,</li>
<li>hold an addiction certification from the American Society of Addiction Medicine, or</li>
<li>have completed not less than 8 hours of authorized training on the treatment or management of opioid-dependent patients.  This training may include classroom situations, seminars at professional society meetings, electronic communications, or other media. The American Society of Addiction Medicine, The American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry, the American Medical Association, the American Osteopathic Association, and the American Psychiatric Association are all authorized to provide this training.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AND meet both of the following criteria: <ul>
<li>have the capacity to provide or to refer patients for necessary ancillary services, such as psychosocial therapy, and</li>
<li>agree to treat no more than 30 patients at any one time in their individual or group practice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Bold">How can I be sure a physician is qualified to prescribe buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets? </span></p>
<p>Physicians who meet the qualification criteria listed in the previous section must also notify the Secretary of the Department of Health &amp; Human Services of their intent to prescribe<span class="Bold"> buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets </span>before doing so.  Once all relevant criteria are verified, DEA will issue the physician a unique identification number indicating that he or she is a qualifying physician under the DATA. </p>
<p>The Center for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4279309" conceptname="Substance abuse">Substance Abuse</span> Treatment (CSAT, a component of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4279309" conceptname="Substance abuse">Substance Abuse</span> and Mental Health Services Administration) will send a letter informing the physician of the new DEA identification number.  The physicians will subsequently receive a revised DEA registration certificate (showing both numbers). </p>
<p>Pharmacists who seek information to verify whether or not physicians have valid waivers may contact 1-866-BUP-CSAT, or by email at info@buprenorphine.samhsa.gov. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">What if I get a prescription from a doctor who does not have a special DEA identification number? </span></p>
<p>Call that physician for clarification that the physician has made the appropriate notification to DHHS.  DEA is developing regulations that will require this number along with the physician's existing DEA registration number to be included on all prescriptions issued for the treatment of opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>; therefore physicians are being strongly urged to include this number on prescriptions.</p>
<p>Most physicians will make arrangements to obtain the identification number before prescribing<span class="Bold"> buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets, </span>but in rare cases a physician may need to write a prescription before the number has been issued.  This is allowed under the DATA provided the physician has notified the Department of Health and Human Services of his/her intention to begin treating a patient right away; the notification form includes a check box for this situation.  </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Are there confidentiality issues I should be aware of related to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4279309" conceptname="Substance abuse">substance abuse</span> treatment?  </span></p>
<p>There are special federal regulations concerning the confidentiality of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4279309" conceptname="Substance abuse">substance abuse</span> treatment records (42 CFR Part 2) and the privacy of health records (HIPAA) which may come into play in your interactions with physicians to verify prescriptions for<span class="Bold"> buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets.  </span>To ensure that physicians will be able to communicate with you to confirm the validity of a<span class="Bold"> buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablet </span>prescription, it is recommended that the physician have the patient sign a release of information at the time of the office visit. A sample consent form with all the elements required under 42 CFR Part 2 is included with this leaflet as an attachment.  It is particularly important to obtain the patient's consent if the physician elects to phone or FAX in prescriptions, as this constitutes disclosure of the patient's treatment.  When the prescription is directly transmitted by the physician, there are also prohibitions on the further redisclosure of patient identifying information by the pharmacist. 42 CFR Part 2 does not apply when it is the patient who delivers the prescription to the pharmacist, without direct communication from the physician to the pharmacist.   </p>
<p>To learn more about these regulations, visit the SAMHSA website www.hipaa.samhsa.gov, or call 1-866-BUP-CSAT for information. </p>
<p>Again, Pharmacists who seek information to verify whether or not physicians have valid waivers may contact 1-866-BUP-CSAT, or by email at info@buprenorphine.samhsa.gov.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">How will physicians obtain supplies of medication for induction?</span></p>
<p>Because induction doses of<span class="Bold"> buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets </span>should be given in the physician's office, many physicians will maintain a supply of each medication in their office. Most physicians will get this supply through their normal supplier or the manufacturer. Some physicians, however, will write prescriptions for individual patients' induction doses at the time of the patient appointment. The prescribing physician may call or fax ahead to your pharmacy to request delivery (if you provide this service), or to ensure the medication will be ready in advance of the patient's arrival. (Recall that the patient is likely to be in mild withdrawal while awaiting the prescription). Some physicians may send a patient's family member to the pharmacy to pick up the induction dose.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What should I do when a patient presents a prescription for an induction dose?</span></p>
<p>Physicians who choose not to maintain supplies of<span class="Bold"> buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets </span>in their offices may give their patients a prescription for their induction doses with instructions to return to the office for supervision while the dose is administered. Fill the prescription as you normally would, then make sure the patient understands that he or she must return to the doctor's office to take the medication. It may take several days of supervised administration to complete the induction process; therefore, some patients may be visiting your pharmacy repeatedly at the beginning of treatment.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Are there any special storage, record-keeping, or other requirements associated with buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets?</span></p>
<p>As a Schedule III controlled substance,<span class="Bold"> buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets </span>is subject to certain federal regulations covering areas such as record-keeping, inventory, proper dispensing and disposal. These are explained in the Drug Enforcement Administration's Pharmacist's Manual, which can be found at  http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/pubs/manuals/pharm2/index.html.</p>
<p>Many states have their own, additional requirements for pharmacists dispensing controlled substances. Be sure to check with the appropriate authority in your state. For more information, visit the website of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy at http://www.nabp.net for links to individual state boards of pharmacy. </p>
<p> In addition, since <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">drug addiction</span> is a sensitive topic, you should make sure you have access to a private area in which to counsel patients about<span class="Bold"> buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets </span>therapy. When speaking with these patients, it is important to keep in mind that addicts in withdrawal may be <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritable</span> and short on patience.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What else can I do to help safeguard against diversion?</span></p>
<p>According to federal law, pharmacists and prescribers jointly share legal responsibility for the legitimacy of a prescription. Communication between you and the prescriber is vital to ensure the validity of each prescription you're asked to fill.</p>
<p>However, even if you determine that an individual prescription is legal, you should still be aware of other means by which addicts may attempt to divert their prescriptions. For example, an opioid user may present to 2 or more qualified prescribers, and therefore receive multiple prescriptions for<span class="Bold"> buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets</span>. If a patient brings you more than 1 prescription covering the same therapeutic period, you have a legal duty to recognize that they are probably not for therapeutic use. You should refuse to fill the second prescription, and notify both prescribing physicians. In addition, you should be aware that the DATA allows each physician to treat no more than 30 patients with buprenorphine at any one time. Obviously, as patients enter and leave treatment, more than 30 patients will be cared for by a particular physician over the course of time. However, if you notice an extraordinary number of new prescriptions from a single physician, you may wish to check with the prescriber to determine whether the prescriptions might be fraudulent. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Where can I get more information on treating opioid addiction with buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Refer to the package insert for full information on the adverse events seen during the clinical trials using buprenorphine for opiate addiction treatment.</li>
<li>Clinical guidelines for buprenorphine treatment and general information on the treatment of addiction is available through numerous sources such as the following: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4279309" conceptname="Substance abuse">Substance Abuse</span> and Mental Health Services (SAMHSA) Center for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4279309" conceptname="Substance abuse">Substance Abuse</span> Treatment (CSAT) Website at http://www.dpt.samhsa.gov American Society of Addiction Medicine Website at http://www.asam.org and the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry website at http://www.aaap.org. </li>

<p><span class="Bold">I am already qualified.  What do I do next? </span></p>
<p>The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug Addiction</span> Treatment Act (DATA) requires that before you begin prescribing buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets you must notify the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services of your intent to treat patients with these products.  The agency within the Department of Health and Human Services to be notified is the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4279309" conceptname="Substance abuse">Substance Abuse</span> and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).  Notification is handled within SAMHSA by the Division of Pharmacologic Therapies (DPT) within the Center for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4279309" conceptname="Substance abuse">Substance Abuse</span> Treatment (CSAT).  For convenience CSAT has developed a form that may be used for your notification.  A copy is enclosed in this package as Attachment A.  You may complete the notification form online or download the form by visiting CSAT's web site at http://www.dpt.samhsa.gov.  If you prefer, you may also notify by letter if you include all of the required information. </p>
<p>All forms (or letters) should be mailed or faxed to:</p>
<p> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4279309" conceptname="Substance abuse">Substance Abuse</span> and Mental Health Services Administration</p>
<p>Division of Pharmacologic Therapies</p>
<p>Attn. Opioid Treatment Waiver Program</p>
<p>One Choke Cherry Rd, Rm 2-1063</p>
<p>Rockville, MD 20857</p>
<p>FAX: (240) 276-1630</p>
<p>Call CSAT/DPT if you have any questions about the notification process or need help completing the form.  They can be reached at (240) 276-2700.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What happens after my notification is sent to CSAT?</span></p>
<p>CSAT will communicate with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), review your notification and then notify DEA that you are qualified as required by the DATA.  The DATA allows 45 days for this review process.  No later than at the end of that 45-day period, DEA will issue a unique identification number indicating that you are a qualifying physician under the DATA. DEA is developing regulations that will require this number along with your existing DEA registration number to be included on all prescriptions issued for the treatment of opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> under the DATA; therefore it is strongly recommended that you include this number when you write prescriptions for<span class="Bold"> buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets </span>for the treatment of opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>.  CSAT will send you a letter notifying you of the new DEA identification number that will be assigned.  You will subsequently receive a revised DEA registration certificate (showing both numbers). </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Do I have to wait 45 days before treating patients? </span></p>
<p>The DATA envisions physicians notifying CSAT as soon as they are qualified, but makes provision for those who find themselves in the position of being qualified and needing to treat a patient, but not having notified CSAT.  In this case, you must first notify CSAT and DEA of your intent before treating the patient; this can be done electronically on the internet by checking the appropriate box, or by faxing in the form included in this package to CSAT at: (240) 276-1630.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">During the training sessions, as well as in the product information and CSAT Guidelines, it is recommended that patients be given initial doses under supervision.  It is not my normal practice to keep a stock of controlled substances in my office.  How do I get buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets for use in the office? If you do not have a normal supplier of such products we will facilitate the establishment of a relationship with a supplier.  You may call us at 1-888-775-1770 or log on to our Website www.hitechpharm.com/drugsafety</span>.</p>
<p>State laws vary regarding stocking of controlled substances.  If you have a routine supplier of products such as vaccines, or injectable products that you use in your office, that supplier will be able to provide you with<span class="Bold"> buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">What storage and record-keeping requirements are associated with maintenance of a supply of buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets in my office? </span></p>
<p>For a full listing of requirements for a specific State you may call us at 1-888-775-1770 or log on to our Web site www.hitechpharm.com/drugsafety. Generally, you will be required to keep the medications in a secure environment.  They should be kept in a locked compartment with limited access. You will also be required to maintain a written record of the disposition of all doses. Usually this can be done with the maintenance of a logbook in which you record all incoming doses and account for each dispensed dose as it is used. This record must be kept current at all times. Additional requirements may be in place in your State.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">While I appreciate the convenience of maintaining a supply of buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets in my office for induction purposes, the situation at our office precludes such an arrangement. How do I manage supervised induction doses without maintaining such a supply in my office?</span></p>
<p>If pharmacy delivery services are available, you may choose to arrange to have the dose delivered to your office; if not give the prescription to the patient (or, if available, to a trustworthy family member accompanying the patient) with instructions that the prescription is to be taken to the pharmacy, filled, and brought back to your office for dosing.  It is recommended that you call or fax ahead to ensure availability of the medication and to reduce patient waiting time.  You should instruct the patient that on his or her return to the office the induction dose will be administered, and that he or she will be monitored in your office.  The pharmacist should reiterate this instruction upon filling the prescription.  You may wish to limit the prescription to one day's dose, and repeat this method for the first several days of treatment before providing a prescription for several days' supply at one time.  Further information regarding this program is available by calling our toll-free Help Line at 1-888-775-1770 or log on to our Website www.hitechpharm.com/drugsafety.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Will these prescriptions be valid at any pharmacy, or will I need to refer patients to a specific store? </span></p>
<p>The prescriptions will be valid at any pharmacy. However, prior to prescribing buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets, it is essential that you establish a relationship with one or more specific pharmacies in your area who will be in a position to provide your patients with initial doses as well as instructions for returning to your office for induction and the follow-up prescription.  (Such a relationship is also recommended if you intend to maintain initial dosing supplies in your office).  Generally, a pharmacy near your office is recommended for patient convenience.  If possible, it is advisable to identify a pharmacy that will deliver initial doses to your office, so that patients do not have to leave and return for induction dosing.  Alternatively, it is recommended that you avail yourself of any call-in or fax-in prescription services provided, to reduce patient waiting time.  </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Are there special confidentiality issues I should consider?</span></p>
<p>Remember that you may be communicating with the pharmacist to verify prescriptions for a particular patient. As you may know, there are special federal regulations concerning the confidentiality of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4279309" conceptname="Substance abuse">substance abuse</span> treatment, records (42 CFR Part 2) and the privacy of health records (HIPAA). To ensure that you will be able to communicate with the pharmacist to confirm the validity of a<span class="Bold"> buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets </span>prescription, it is recommended that you have the patient sign a release of information at the time of the office visit. A sample consent form with all the elements required under 42 CFR Part 2 is included with this leaflet as Attachment B. It is particularly important to obtain the patient's consent if you elect to phone or FAX in prescriptions, as this constitutes disclosure of the patient's treatment. When the prescription is directly transmitted by the physician, there are also prohibitions on the further redisclosure of patient identifying information by the pharmacist. 42 CFR Part 2 does not apply when it is the patient who delivers the prescription to the pharmacist, without direct communication from the physician to the pharmacist.</p>
<p>To learn more about these regulations, visit the SAMHSA website http://www.hipaa.samhsa.gov, or call 1-866-BUP-CSAT</p>
<p><span class="Bold">I'm familiar with general principles of addiction treatment, but this is my first experience with office-based prescription of this type of medication. What precautions should I take in my practice to prevent diversion and abuse?</span></p>
<p>You should consider the following suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initiate treatment with supervised administration, progressing to unsupervised administration as your patient's clinical stability permits.</li>
<li>Limit the use of<span class="Bold"> buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets </span>to supervised use wherever possible. Recall that the buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets product contains naloxone, which<span class="Bold"> buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets </span>does not. The naloxone in buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets is likely to precipitate withdrawal symptoms when injected by individuals dependent on heroin, morphine, or other full opiate agonists. Therefore, it is expected that buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets will be less attractive to "street addicts" and less likely to be diverted. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets be used whenever unsupervised administration is planned.</li>
<li>As your patients progress, and you consider prescribing<span class="Bold"> buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets </span>for take-home use; when determining the size of the prescription you write, you should consider your patient's level of stability, the security of his or her home situation, and other factors likely to affect the ability to manage supplies of take-home medication.</li>
<li>Have plans in place to deal with patient requests for replacement of prescriptions or supplies of medication that are described as lost or stolen.</li>
<li>Keep tight control of your prescription pads. Never leave them in the examination room, even inside a desk drawer. Never sign an incomplete prescription blank.</li>
<li>Write all numbers (quantity and strength) in both numbers and letters – like you write your checks.</li>
<li>Establish a relationship with the pharmacies you expect to be filling your prescriptions for<span class="Bold"> buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets </span>and discuss potential diversion problems and controls with them.</li>
<li>Request photo (or other) I.D. and Social Security number and maintain copies in patient's record.</li>
<li>If you suspect an attempt to divert prescription medications, call your local police department.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Bold">Where can I get more information on treating patients with buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Refer to the physician package insert for prescribing information. Additional recommendations may be found in treatment guidelines available for free from the Center for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4279309" conceptname="Substance abuse">Substance Abuse</span> Treatment at the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4279309" conceptname="Substance abuse">Substance Abuse</span> and Mental Health Services Administration. To obtain a copy please call our toll-free Help Line at 1-888-775-1770 or log on to our Web site www.hitechpharm.com/drugsafety. Additional information is also available on the CSAT web site at http://www.dpt.samhsa.gov.</li>
<li>Refer to the package insert for full information on the adverse events seen during the clinical trials using buprenorphine for opiate addiction treatment. Note the important precautions and warnings to share with patients, such as the risk of fatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> when buprenorphine is combined with other depressants. Also note other important safety issues such as the fact that buprenorphine should be administered with caution in the elderly or debilitated patient, and those with severe impairment of hepatic, pulmonary or renal function; and that buprenorphine may impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery, especially during drug induction and dose adjustment.</li>
