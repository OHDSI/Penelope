<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">Yellow fever</span> is an acute viral illness caused by a mosquito-borne flavivirus. The clinical spectrum of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> is highly variable, from subclinical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> to overwhelming pansystemic disease. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">Yellow fever</span> has an abrupt onset after an incubation period of 3 to 6 days, and usually includes <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">prostration</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260194" conceptname="Photophobia">photophobia</span>, lumbosacral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, extremity <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> (especially the knee joints), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194175" conceptname="Left upper quadrant pain">epigastric pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">anorexia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>. The illness may progress to liver and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span>, and hemorrhagic symptoms and signs caused by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span> and abnormal clotting and coagulation may occur. The case-fatality rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> varies widely in different studies and may be different for Africa compared to South America, but is typically 20% or higher. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">Jaundice</span> or other gross evidence of severe liver disease is associated with higher mortality rates. (<a href="#SR">1</a>)</p>
<p>Two live, attenuated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> vaccines, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> 17D-204 and 17DD, were derived in parallel in the 1930s. Historical data suggest that these "17D vaccines" have identical safety and immunogenicity profiles. Despite a marked reduction in the world-wide incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> in the last five decades due to the extensive use of 17D vaccines and mosquito eradication programs, at least seven tropical South American countries (Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Peru, and Venezuela) and much of sub-Saharan Africa (<a href="#SR">2</a>) currently experience <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> epidemics. However, the actual areas of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> virus activity far exceed the infected zones officially reported for epidemics. Approximately 200,000 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> cases have been reported to occur world-wide each year. Six fatalities from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> were reported between 1996 and July 2002, among unimmunized American and European travelers who visited rural areas within the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> endemic zone. (<a href="#SR">3</a>) (<a href="#SR">4</a>) (<a href="#SR">5</a>) (<a href="#SR">6</a>) (<a href="#SR">7</a>) (<a href="#SR">8</a>)</p>
<p>Vaccination with 17D <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span> viruses is predicted to elicit an immune response identical in quality to that induced by wild-type <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>. This response is presumed to result from initial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> of cells in the dermis or other subcutaneous tissues near the injection site, with subsequent replication and limited spread of virus leading to the processing and presentation of viral antigens to the immune system, as would occur during <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> with wild-type <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> virus. The humoral immune response to the viral structural proteins, as opposed to a cell-mediated response, is most important in the protective effect induced by 17D vaccines. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">Yellow fever</span> antibodies with specificities that prevent or abort <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> of cells are detected as neutralizing antibodies in assays that measure the ability of serum to reduce plaque formation in tissue culture cells. The titer of virus neutralizing antibodies in sera of vaccinees is a surrogate for efficacy. A log<span class="Sub">10 </span>neutralization index (LNI, measured by a plaque reduction assay) of 0.7 or greater was shown to protect 90% of monkeys from lethal intracerebral challenge. (<a href="#SR">9</a>) This is the definition of seroconversion adopted for clinical trials of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> vaccine. The standard has also been adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) for efficacy of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> vaccines in humans. (<a href="#SR">10</a>)</p>
<p>The neutralizing antibody response to 17D vaccines has been evaluated in several uncontrolled studies since the late 1930s. In 24 studies conducted world-wide between 1962 and 1997 using 17D vaccines involving a total of 2,529 adults and 991 infants and children, the seroconversion rate was greater than 91% in all but two studies and never lower than 81%. There were no significant age-related differences in immunogenicity. (<a href="#SR">1</a>) </p>
<p>Five of these 24 studies were conducted in the US between 1962 and 1993 and included 208 adults who received YF-VAX vaccine. The seroconversion rate was 81% in one study involving 32 subjects and 97% to 100% in the other four studies. (<a href="#SR">11</a>) (<a href="#SR">12</a>) (<a href="#SR">13</a>) (<a href="#SR">14</a>) (<a href="#SR">15</a>) </p>
<p>In 2001, YF-VAX vaccine was used as a control in a double-blind, randomized comparison trial with another 17D-204 vaccine, conducted at nine centers in the US. YF-VAX vaccine was administered to 725 adults ≥18 years old with a mean age of 38 years. Three hundred twelve of these subjects who received YF-VAX vaccine were evaluated serologically, and 99.3% of them seroconverted with a mean LNI of 2.21. The LNI was slightly higher among males compared to females and slightly lower among Hispanic and African-American subjects compared to others, but these differences were not significant with respect to the protective effect of the vaccine. There was no difference in mean LNI for subjects &lt;40 years old compared to subjects ≥40 years old. Due to the small number of subjects (1.7%) with prior flavivirus immunity, it was not possible to draw conclusions about the role of this factor in the immune response. (<a href="#SR">16</a>)</p>
<p>Results of one clinical trial involving 33 HIV-positive adults residing in the US indicate that the seroconversion rate to 17D-204 vaccine may be reduced in these patients. (<a href="#SR">17</a>)</p>
<p>In pregnancy or in immunosuppressed individuals the seroconversion rate after administration of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> vaccine may be significantly reduced. (<a href="#SR">18</a>)</p>
<p>Existing data suggest that the small percentage of immunologically normal subjects who fail to develop an immune response to an initial vaccination may do so upon re-vaccination. (<a href="#SR">19</a>)</p>
<p>In two separate clinical trials of 17D-204 vaccines, 90% of subjects seroconverted within 10 days after vaccination, (<a href="#SR">20</a>) and 100% of subjects seroconverted within 14 days. (<a href="#SR">11</a>) Thus, International Health regulations stipulate that the vaccination certificate for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> is valid 10 days after administration of YF-VAX vaccine.

<h2>Persons Living in or Traveling to Endemic Areas</h2>
<p class="First">While the actual risk for contracting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> during travel is probably low, variability of itineraries and behaviors and the seasonal incidence of disease make it difficult to predict the actual risk for a given individual traveling to a known endemic or epidemic area. Persons greater than or equal to 9 months of age traveling to or living in areas of South America and Africa where <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> is officially reported at the time of travel should be vaccinated. Vaccination is also recommended for travel outside the urban areas of countries that do not officially report the disease but that lie in a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> endemic zone.</p>

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Prior to administration of YF-VAX vaccine, potential vaccinees or their parents or guardians should be asked about their recent health status. All potential vaccinees or their parents or guardians should be fully informed of the benefits and risks of immunization and potential for adverse events that have been temporally associated with YF-VAX vaccine administration. Vaccinees or their parents or guardians should be instructed to report all serious adverse events that occur up to 30 days post-vaccination to their health-care provider.</p>
<p>All travelers should seek information regarding vaccination requirements by consulting local health departments, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and WHO. Travel agencies, international airlines, and/or shipping lines may also have up-to-date information. Such requirements may be strictly enforced, particularly for persons traveling from Africa or South America to Asia. Travelers should consult the latest published version of Health Information for International Travel to determine requirements and regulations for vaccination. (<a href="#SR">25</a>)</p>
<p>An International Certificate of Vaccination should be completed, signed, and validated with the center's stamp where the vaccine is administered and provided to all vaccinees. The immunization record should contain the date, lot number and manufacturer of the vaccine administered. (<a href="#SR">30</a>) (<a href="#SR">31</a>) (<a href="#SR">32</a>) Subjects should be told that US vaccination certificates are valid for a period of 10 years commencing 10 days after initial vaccination or revaccination.</p>

<p>No placebo-controlled trials to assess the safety of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> 17D vaccines have been performed. However, between 1953 and 1994, reactogenicity of 17D-204 vaccine was monitored in 10 uncontrolled clinical trials. The trials included a total of 3,933 adults and 264 infants greater than 4 months old residing in Europe or in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> endemic areas.

Also in this study, reactogenicity of the vaccine was markedly reduced among a subset of subjects who had serological evidence of previous exposure to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> virus. Only two of the ten studies provided diary cards for daily reporting; this method resulted in a slightly higher incidence of local and systemic complaints. (<a href="#SR">1</a>)</p>
<p>In 2001, YF-VAX vaccine was used as a control in a double-blind, randomized comparative trial with another 17D-204 vaccine, conducted at nine centers in the US. YF-VAX vaccine was administered to 725 adults ≥18 years old with a mean age of 38 years. Safety data were collected by diary card for days 1 through 10 after vaccination and by interview on days 5, 11, and 31. Among subjects who received YF-VAX vaccine, there were no serious adverse events, and 71.9% experienced non-serious adverse events judged to have been related to vaccination. Most of these were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4316202" conceptname="Injection site reaction">injection site reactions</span> of mild to moderate severity. Four such local reactions were considered severe. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">Rash</span> occurred in 3.2% and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="139900" conceptname="Urticaria">urticaria</span> in two subjects.

(<a href="#SR">16</a>) </p>
<p>A CDC analysis of data submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) between 1990 and 1998 suggests that patients aged 65 or older are at increased risk for systemic adverse events temporally associated with vaccination, compared to the 25- to 44-year-old age group (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#precautions">PRECAUTIONS</a></span> section, <span class="Bold"><a href="#GU">Geriatric Use</a></span> subsection). The rate of systemic adverse events occurring post-vaccination in patients age 65 to 74 was 2.5 times higher than the rate occurring in patients age 25 to 44, based on incidence rates of 6.21 and 2.49 per 100,000 doses of vaccine in the two groups, respectively.

Age less than 9 months and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242843" conceptname="Immunosuppression">immunosuppression</span> are known risk factors. Twenty-one cases of vaccine-associated neurotropic disease associated with all licensed 17D vaccines have been reported between 1952 and 2004, 18 in children or adolescents. Fifteen of these cases occurred prior to 1960, thirteen of which occurred in infants 4 months of age or younger, and two of which occurred in infants six and seven months old. Six cases were reported between 1960 and 1996, world-wide. Three occurred in children, including a one-month-old infant, a three-year-old, and a thirteen-year-old. The three-year-old died of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378143" conceptname="Encephalitis">encephalitis</span>, and a genetic variant of the vaccine virus was isolated from the brain in this case. (<a href="#SR">39</a>) This is the only verified fatality due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> vaccine-associated neurotropic disease.

<p>The incidence of vaccine-associated neurotropic disease in infants less than 4 months old is estimated to be between 0.5 and 4 per 1,000, based on two historical reports where denominators are available. (<a href="#SR">40</a>) (<a href="#SR">41</a>) No data are available for calculation of an age-specific incidence rate in the 4- to 9-month-age group.

<h2>Viscerotropic Disease</h2>
<p class="First">Vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease, previously described as multiple organ system failure (<a href="#SR">26</a>), is a known rare serious adverse event associated with 17D vaccination. No cause and effect relationship has been established between vaccination and these subsequent illnesses. Physicians should therefore be cautious to administer <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> vaccine only to those persons truly at risk of exposure to wild-type <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> virus <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>. (<a href="#SR">2</a>)</p>
<p>Between 1996 and 1998, four patients, ages 63, 67, 76, and 79, became severely ill 2 to 5 days after vaccination with YF-VAX vaccine. Three of these 4 subjects died. The clinical presentations were characterized by a non-specific febrile syndrome with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442752" conceptname="Muscle pain">myalgia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, rapidly progressing to a severe illness including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4256228" conceptname="Respiratory failure">respiratory failure</span>, elevated hepatocellular enzymes, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441541" conceptname="Lymphocytopenia">lymphocytopenia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4032334" conceptname="Hyperbilirubinemia">hyperbilirubinemia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> requiring hemodialysis. (<a href="#SR">26</a>) None of these subjects had vaccine-associated neurotropic disease. In two cases where vaccine virus was recovered from serum, limited nucleotide sequence analysis of the viral genome suggested that the isolates had not undergone a mutation associated with an increase in virulence. The incidence rate for these serious adverse events was estimated at 1 per 400,000 doses of YF-VAX vaccine, based on the total number of doses administered in the US civilian population during the surveillance period.</p>
<p>Vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease temporally associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> vaccination has also been reported in Australia and Brazil. One Australian citizen became ill after receiving an immunization with the 17D-204 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span> of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> vaccine in his home country, (<a href="#SR">28</a>) and two Brazilian citizens (age 5 and 22 years) became ill three to four days after receiving 17DD vaccine in Brazil. (<a href="#SR">29</a>) In the Brazilian and Australian cases, histopathologic changes in the liver included midzonal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280654" conceptname="Necrosis">necrosis</span>, microvesicular fatty change, and Councilman bodies, which are characteristic of wild-type <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span>. Vaccine-type <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> virus was isolated from blood and autopsy material (ie, brain, liver, kidney, spleen, lung, skeletal muscle, or skin) of each of these three persons, all of whom died 8 to 11 days after vaccination. In Brazil, an estimated 23 million vaccine doses were administered during the 15-month period during which the two cases of multiple organ system failure were reported. (<a href="#SR">29</a>)</p>
<p>In view of the data cited above, both the 17D-204 and 17DD <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> vaccines may be considered as a possible, but rare, cause of vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (<a href="#SR">2</a>) that is similar to fulminant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> caused by wild-type <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> virus. All available evidence from complete nucleotide sequence analysis and testing in experimental animals of vaccine-type <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> viruses isolated from the Brazilian subjects suggests that the occurrences are due to undefined host factors, rather than to intrinsic virulence of the 17DD vaccine viruses. (<a href="#SR">27</a>)</p>
<p>Because of a lack of tissue specimens from most of the US cases of vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease and the qualitative differences between the US cases and those identified in Brazil and Australia, no definitive support for a causal relationship exists between receipt of YF-VAX vaccine and vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease. However, the temporal association with recent receipt of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> vaccine and the similarity of the clinical presentations among all four US cases suggest that the vaccine may play a role in pathogenesis of the cases.</p>

However, the percentage of pregnant women who seroconverted was significantly reduced compared to a non-pregnant control group (38.6% vs. 81.5%). (<a href="#SR">18</a>)</p>
<p>Following a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> immunization campaign in Trinidad, during which 100 to 200 pregnant females were immunized, no adverse events related to pregnancy were reported. In addition, 41 cord blood samples were obtained from infants born to mothers immunized during the first trimester. One of these infants tested positive for IgM antibodies in cord blood. The infant appeared normal at delivery and no subsequent adverse sequelae of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> were reported. However, this result suggests that transplacental <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> with 17D vaccine viruses can occur. (<a href="#SR">44</a>)</p>
<p>A recent case-control study of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4067106" conceptname="Miscarriage">spontaneous abortion</span> following vaccination of Brazilian women found no significant difference in the odds ratio among vaccinated women compared to a similar unvaccinated group.

<h2>Reporting of Adverse Events</h2>
<p class="First">The US Department of Health and Human Services has established the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to accept all reports of suspected adverse events after the administration of any vaccine. Reporting of all adverse events occurring after vaccine administration is encouraged from vaccine recipients, parents/guardians and the health care provider. Adverse events following immunization should be reported to VAERS. Reporting forms and information about reporting requirements or completion of the form can be obtained from VAERS through a toll-free number 1-800-822-7967. (<a href="#SR">30</a>) Reporting forms may also be obtained at the FDA web site at http://vaers.hhs.gov.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Health-care providers also should report these events to Sanofi Pasteur Inc., Discovery Drive, Swiftwater, PA 18370 or call 1-800-822-2463.</span></p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-9.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Primary Vaccination</h2>
<p class="First">For all eligible persons, a single subcutaneous injection of 0.5 mL of reconstituted vaccine (formulated to contain not less than 4.74 log<span class="Sub">10 </span>PFU throughout the life of the product) should be administered. Immunity develops by the 10th day after primary vaccination. (<a href="#SR">11</a>) (<a href="#SR">25</a>) (<a href="#SR">46</a>)</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-9.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Booster Doses</h2>
<p class="First">Re-immunization with 17D vaccine is recommended every 10 years for those at continuing risk of exposure and is required by International Health Regulations. (<a href="#SR">23</a>) Revaccination boosts antibody titer, although evidence from several studies suggests that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> vaccine immunity persists for at least 30 to 35 years and probably for life, (<a href="#SR">47</a>) and epidemiologic data suggest that a single <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> with wild-type <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> virus provides lifelong immunity against illness due to subsequent exposure.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-9.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Concomitant Administration with other Vaccines</h2>
<p class="First">Determination of whether to administer <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441210" conceptname="Yellow fever">yellow fever</span> vaccine and other immunobiologics simultaneously should be made on the basis of convenience to the traveler in completing the desired vaccinations before travel and on information regarding possible interference. Limited data are available related to administration of YF-VAX vaccine with other vaccines. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#precautions">PRECAUTIONS</a></span> section, <span class="Bold"><a href="#DI">Drug Interactions</a></span> subsection.) In those specific instances where vaccines may be given concurrently, injections should be administered at separate sites. Where there are no data to support administration of YF-VAX vaccine concurrently with other vaccines, 4 weeks should elapse between sequential vaccinations. (<a href="#SR">2</a>)</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-9.4"></a><p></p>
<h2>Vaccine Preparation</h2>
<ul class="Disc">
<li>Reconstitute the vaccine using only the diluent supplied (0.6 mL vial of Sodium Chloride Injection USP for single dose vial of vaccine and 3 mL vial of Sodium Chloride Injection USP for 5 dose vial of vaccine). Draw the volume of the diluent, shown on the diluent label, into a suitable size syringe and slowly inject into the vial containing the vaccine. Allow the reconstituted vaccine to sit for one to two minutes and then carefully swirl mixture until a uniform suspension is achieved. Avoid vigorous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">shaking</span> as this tends to cause foaming of the suspension. Do not dilute reconstituted vaccine.</li>
<li>YF-VAX vaccine is a slight pink-brown suspension after reconstitution. If the product contains extraneous particulate matter or is discolored, do not administer the vaccine.</li>
<li>SWIRL VACCINE WELL before withdrawing each dose. Administer the single immunizing dose of 0.5 mL subcutaneously using a 5/8- to 3/4-inch long needle (<a href="#SR">23</a>) within 60 minutes of reconstituting the vial.</li>
</ul>
<p class="First">Properly dispose of all reconstituted vaccine and containers that remain unused after one hour (eg, sterilized or disposed in red hazardous waste containers). (<a href="#SR">2</a>) </p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="desen"></a><a name="section-9.5"></a><p></p>
<h2>Desensitization</h2>
<p class="First">(<a href="#SR">23</a>)</p>
<p>If immunization is imperative and the individual has a history of severe egg sensitivity and has a positive skin test to the vaccine, this desensitization procedure may be used to administer the vaccine.</p>
<p>The following successive doses should be administered subcutaneously at 15- to 20-minute intervals:</p>
<dl>
<dt>1.</dt>
<dd>0.05 mL of 1:10 dilution </dd>
<dt>2.</dt>
<dd>0.05 mL of full strength </dd>
<dt>3.</dt>
<dd>0.10 mL of full strength </dd>
<dt>4.</dt>
<dd>0.15 mL of full strength </dd>
<dt>5.</dt>
<dd>0.20 mL of full strength </dd>
</dl>
<p>Desensitization should only be performed under the direct supervision of a physician experienced in the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylaxis</span> with necessary emergency equipment immediately available.</p>
