<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Parkinson's disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder of the extrapyramidal nervous system affecting the mobility and control of the skeletal muscular system. Its characteristic features include resting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4050941" conceptname="Muscle rigidity">rigidity</span>, and bradykinetic movements. Symptomatic treatments, such as levodopa therapies, may permit the patient better mobility.</p>

<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Current evidence indicates that symptoms of Parkinson's disease are related to depletion of dopamine in the corpus striatum. Administration of dopamine is ineffective in the treatment of Parkinson's disease apparently because it does not cross the blood-brain barrier. However, levodopa, the metabolic precursor of dopamine, does cross the blood-brain barrier, and presumably is converted to dopamine in the brain. This is thought to be the mechanism whereby levodopa relieves symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="43681-6">
<a name="ID_ccd96555-42dd-49b0-a775-ae173ed75675"></a><a name="section-3.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">When levodopa is administered orally it is rapidly decarboxylated to dopamine in extracerebral tissues so that only a small portion of a given dose is transported unchanged to the central nervous system. For this reason, large doses of levodopa are required for adequate therapeutic effect and these may often be accompanied by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and other adverse reactions, some of which are attributable to dopamine formed in extracerebral tissues.</p>
<p>The incidence of levodopa-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> is less when LODOSYN is used with levodopa than when levodopa is used without LODOSYN. In many patients this reduction in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> will permit more rapid dosage titration.</p>
<p>Carbidopa inhibits decarboxylation of peripheral levodopa. Carbidopa has not been demonstrated to have any overt pharmacodynamic actions in the recommended doses. It does not appear to cross the blood-brain barrier readily and does not affect the metabolism of levodopa within the central nervous system at doses of carbidopa that are recommended for maximum effective inhibition of peripheral decarboxylation of levodopa.</p>
<p>Since its decarboxylase-inhibiting activity is limited primarily to extracerebral tissues, administration of carbidopa with levodopa makes more levodopa available for transport to the brain. However, since levodopa and carbidopa compete with certain amino acids for transport across the gut wall, the absorption of levodopa and carbidopa may be impaired in some patients on a high protein diet.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Carbidopa reduces the amount of levodopa required to produce a given response by about 75% and, when administered with levodopa, increases both plasma levels and the plasma half-life of levodopa, and decreases plasma and urinary dopamine and homovanillic acid.</p>
<p>In clinical pharmacologic studies, simultaneous administration of separate tablets of carbidopa and levodopa produced greater urinary excretion of levodopa in proportion to the excretion of dopamine when compared to the two drugs administered at separate times.</p>
<p>Supplemental pyridoxine (vitamin B<span class="Sub">6</span>) can be given to patients when they are receiving carbidopa and levodopa concomitantly or the fixed combination carbidopa-levodopa or carbidopa-levodopa extended release. Previous reports in the medical literature cautioned that high doses of vitamin B<span class="Sub">6</span> should not be taken by patients on levodopa therapy alone because exogenously administered pyridoxine would enhance the metabolism of levodopa to dopamine. The introduction of carbidopa to levodopa therapy, which inhibits the peripheral decarboxylation of levodopa to dopamine, counteracts the metabolic-enhancing effect of pyridoxine.</p>
<p>Carbidopa is combined with levodopa in carbidopa-levodopa and carbidopa-levodopa</p>
<p>extended release tablets.</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">LODOSYN is indicated for use with carbidopa-levodopa or with levodopa in the treatment of</p>
<p>the symptoms of idiopathic Parkinsonâ€™s disease (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440377" conceptname="Paralysis">paralysis</span> agitans), postencephalitic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4140090" conceptname="Parkinsonism">parkinsonism</span>, and symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4140090" conceptname="Parkinsonism">parkinsonism</span>, which may follow injury to the nervous system</p>
<p>by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4198996" conceptname="Carbon monoxide">carbon monoxide</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> and/or manganese <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>.</p>
<p>LODOSYN is for use with carbidopa-levodopa in patients for whom the dosage of</p>
<p>carbidopa-levodopa provides less than adequate daily dosage (usually 70 mg daily) of</p>
<p>carbidopa.</p>
<p>LODOSYN is for use with levodopa in the occasional patient whose dosage requirement of</p>
<p>carbidopa and levodopa necessitates separate titration of each medication</p>
<p>LODOSYN is used with carbidopa-levodopa or with levodopa to permit the administration</p>
<p>of lower doses of levodopa with reduced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, more rapid dosage titration,</p>
<p>and with a somewhat smoother response. However, patients with markedly irregular (â€œon-offâ€?)</p>
<p>responses to levodopa have not been shown to benefit from the addition of carbidopa.</p>
<p>Since carbidopa prevents the reversal of levodopa effects caused by pyridoxine, supplemental</p>
<p>pyridoxine (vitamin B6), can be given to patients when they are receiving carbidopa and</p>
<p>levodopa concomitantly or as carbidopa-levodopa.</p>
<p>Although the administration of LODOSYN permits control of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4140090" conceptname="Parkinsonism">parkinsonism</span> and Parkinsonâ€™s</p>
<p>disease with much lower doses of levodopa, there is no conclusive evidence at present that this</p>
<p>is beneficial other than in reducing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, permitting more rapid titration, and providing a somewhat smoother response to levodopa.</p>
<p>Certain patients who responded poorly to levodopa alone have improved when carbidopa and</p>
<p>levodopa were given concurrently. This was most likely due to decreased peripheral decarboxylation of levodopa rather than to a primary effect of carbidopa on the peripheral</p>
<p>nervous system. Carbidopa has not been shown to enhance the intrinsic efficacy of levodopa.</p>
<p>In deciding whether to give LODOSYN with carbidopa-levodopa or with levodopa to patients who have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, the physician should be aware that, while many patients may be expected to improve, some may not. Since one cannot predict which patients are likely to improve, this can only be determined by a trial of therapy. It should be further noted that in controlled trials comparing carbidopa and levodopa with levodopa alone, about half the patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> on levodopa alone improved spontaneously despite being retained on the same dose of levodopa during the controlled portion of the trial.</p>

<h3><span class="Italics">Information for Patients</span></h3>
<p class="First">It is important that LODOSYN with levodopa be taken at regular intervals according to the</p>
<p>schedule outlined by the health care provider. Caution patients not to change the prescribed</p>
<p>dosage regimen and not to add any additional antiparkinson medications, including other</p>
<p>carbidopa-levodopa preparations without first consulting a physician.</p>
<p>Advise patients that sometimes a â€˜wearing-offâ€™ effect may occur at the end of the dosing</p>
<p>Interval. Tell patients to notify the prescriber if such response poses a problem to lifestyle.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised that occasionally dark color (red, brown, or black) may appear in</p>
<p>saliva, urine, or sweat after ingestion of LODOSYN and levodopa. Although the color appears</p>
<p>to be clinically insignificant, garments may become discolored.</p>
<p>The patient should be advised that a change in diet to foods that are high in protein may delay</p>
<p>The absorption of levodopa and may reduce the amount taken up in the circulation. Excessive acidity also delays stomach emptying thus delaying the absorption of levodopa. Iron salts (such as in multivitamin tablets) may also reduce the amount of levodopa available in the body. The above factors may reduce the clinical effectiveness of the LODOSYN and levodopa therapy.</p>
<p>Alert patients to the possibility of sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases</p>
<p>without awareness or warning signs, when they are taking dopaminergic agents, including</p>
<p>levodopa. Advise patients to exercise caution while driving or operating machinery and that if</p>
<p>they have experience <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> and/or sudden sleep onset, they must refrain from these</p>
<p>activities. (See WARNINGS, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">Falling</span> Asleep During Activities of Daily Living and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">Somnolence</span></p>
<p>General.)</p>
<p>There have been reports of patients experiencing intense urges to gamble, increased sexual</p>
<p>urges, and other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinsonâ€™s disease, including LODOSYN and levodopa. Although it is not proven that the medications caused these events, these urges were reported to have stopped in some cases when the dose was reduced or the medication was stopped. Prescribers should ask patients about the development of new or increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4023166" conceptname="Gambling">gambling</span> urges, sexual urges, or other intense urges while taking LODOSYN and levodopa. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping</p>
<p>Lodosyn and levodopa if a patient develops such urges while taking Lodosyn with carbidopa/levodopa (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#PRECAUTIONSImpulseControlCompulsiveBehav">PRECAUTIONS, Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors).</a></span></p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Caution should be exercised when the following drugs are administered concomitantly with</span> LODOSYN (Carbidopa) <span class="Italics">given with levodopa or carbidopa-levodopa combination products.</span></p>
<p>Symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span> has occurred when LODOSYN, given with levodopa or</p>
<p>carbidopa-levodopa combination products, was added to the treatment of a patient receiving antihypertensive drugs. Therefore, when therapy with LODOSYN, given with or without levodopa or carbidopa-levodopa combination products, is started, dosage adjustment of</p>
<p>the antihypertensive drug may be required.</p>
<p>For patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors (Type A or B), see <span class="Bold"><a href="#train">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span>. Concomitant therapy with selegiline and carbidopa-levodopa may be associated with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span> not attributable to carbidopa-levodopa alone (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#train">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span>).</p>
<p>There have been rare reports of adverse reactions, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047115" conceptname="Oral dyskinesia">dyskinesia</span>, resulting from the concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants and carbidopa-levodopa preparations.</p>
<p>Dopamine D<span class="Sub">2</span> receptor antagonists (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones, risperidone) and isoniazid may reduce the therapeutic effects of levodopa. In addition, the beneficial effects of levodopa in Parkinson's disease have been reported to be reversed by phenytoin and papaverine. Patients taking these drugs with LODOSYN and levodopa or carbidopa-levodopa combination products should be carefully observed for loss of therapeutic response.</p>
<p>LODOSYN and iron salts or multi vitamins containing iron salts should be co administered</p>
<p>with caution. Iron salts can form chelates with levodopa and carbidopa and</p>
<p>consequently reduce the bioavailability of carbidopa and levodopa.</p>
<p>Although metoclopramide may increase the bioavailability of levodopa by increasing gastric emptying, metoclopramide may also adversely affect disease control by its dopamine receptor antagonistic properties.</p>

<h3>Pregnancy Category C</h3>
<p class="First">There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with LODOSYN in pregnant women. It has been reported from individual cases that levodopa crosses the human placental barrier, enters the fetus, and is metabolized. Carbidopa concentrations in fetal tissue appeared to be minimal. LODOSYN should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<p>Carbidopa, at doses as high as 120 mg/kg/day, was without teratogenic effects in the mouse or rabbit. In the rabbit, but not in the mouse, carbidopa-levodopa produced visceral anomalies, similar to those seen with levodopa alone, at approximately 7 times the maximum recommended human dose. The teratogenic effect of levodopa in rabbits was unchanged by the concomitant administration of carbidopa.</p>

<p>It is not known whether carbidopa is excreted in human milk.

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">No reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> with LODOSYN have been received. Management of overdosage with carbidopa is the same as that with levodopa or carbidopa-levodopa preparations.</p>
<p>In the event of overdosage, general supportive measures should be employed, along with immediate gastric lavage. Intravenous fluids should be administered judiciously, and an adequate airway maintained. Electrocardiographic monitoring should be instituted and the patient carefully observed for the development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span>; if required, appropriate antiarrhythmic therapy should be given. The possibility that the patient may have taken other drugs as well as LODOSYN should be taken into consideration. To date, no experience has been reported with dialysis; hence, its value in overdosage is not known. Pyridoxine is not effective in reversing the actions of LODOSYN.</p>
<p>Based on studies in which high doses of levodopa and/or carbidopa were administered, a significant proportion of rats and mice given single oral doses of levodopa of approximately 1500-2000 mg/kg are expected to die. A significant proportion of infant rats of both sexes are expected to die at a dose of 800 mg/kg. A significant proportion of rats are expected to die after treatment with similar doses of carbidopa. The addition of carbidopa in a 1:10 ratio with levodopa increases the dose at which a significant proportion of mice are expected to die to 3360 mg/kg.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Whether given with carbidopa-levodopa or with levodopa, the optimal daily dose of</p>
<p>LODOSYN must be determined by careful titration. Most patients respond to a 1:10</p>
<p>proportion of carbidopa and levodopa, provided the daily dosage of carbidopa is 70 mg or</p>
<p>more a day. The maximum daily dosage of carbidopa should not exceed 200 mg, since</p>
<p>clinical experience with larger dosages is limited. If the patient is taking carbidopa-levodopa,</p>
<p>the amount of carbidopa in carbidopa-levodopa should be considered when calculating the</p>
<p>total amount of LODOSYN to be administered each day.</p>

<h2>Patients Receiving Carbidopa-Levodopa Who Require Additional Carbidopa</h2>
<p class="First">Some patients taking carbidopa-levodopa may not have adequate reduction in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> when the dosage of carbidopa is less than 70 mg a day, and the dosage of levodopa</p>
<p>is less than 700 mg a day. When these patients are taking carbidopa-levodopa, 25 mg of LODOSYN may be given with the first dose of carbidopa-levodopa each day. Additional doses of 12.5 mg or 25 mg may be given during the day with each dose of carbidopalevodopa. LODOSYN may be given with any dose carbidopa-levodopa as required for optimum therapeutic response. The maximum daily dosage of carbidopa, given as LODOSYN</p>
<p>and as carbidopa- levodopa), should not exceed 200 mg.</p>

<h2>Patients Requiring Individual Titration of Carbidopa and Levodopa Dosage</h2>
<p class="First">Although carbidopa-levodopa is the most frequently used of carbidopa and levodopa</p>
<p>administration, there may be an occasional patient who requires individually titrated doses of</p>
<p>these two drugs. <span class="Bold">In these patients, LODOSYN (carbidopa) should be initiated at a dosage</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">of 25 mg three or four times a day. The two drugs should be given at the same time,</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">starting with no more than one-fifth (20%) to one-fourth (25%) of the previous or</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">recommended daily dosage of levodopa when given without LODOSYN (Carbidopa). In</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">patients already receiving levodopa therapy, at least twelve hours should elapse between</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">the last dose of levodopa and initiation of therapy with LODOSYN (Carbidopa) and</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">levodopa. A convenient way to initiate therapy in these patients is in the morning</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">following a night when the patient has not taken levodopa for at least twelve hours.</span></p>
<p>Health care providers who prescribe separate doses of LODOSYN and levodopa should be</p>
<p>thoroughly familiar with the directions for use of each drug.</p>

<h2>Dosage Adjustment</h2>
<p class="First">Dosage of LODOSYN may be adjusted by adding or omitting one-half or one tablet a day. Because both therapeutic and adverse responses occur more rapidly with combined therapy than when only levodopa is given, patients should be monitored closely during the dose adjustment period. Specifically, involuntary movements will occur more rapidly when LODOSYN and levodopa are given concomitantly than when levodopa is given without LODOSYN. The occurrence of involuntary movements may require dosage reduction. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435802" conceptname="Blepharospasm">Blepharospasm</span> may be a useful early sign of excess dosage in some patients.</p>
<p>Current evidence indicates other standard antiparkinsonian drugs may be continued while carbidopa and levodopa are being administered. However, the dosage of such other standard antiparkinsonian drugs</p>
<p>may require adjustment.</p>

<a name="ID_31844fdc-1347-40b2-993a-961eae453631"></a><a name="section-10.4"></a><p></p>
<h2>Interruption of Therapy</h2>
<p class="First">Sporadic cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260205" conceptname="Hyperpyrexia">hyperpyrexia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> have been associated with dose reductions and</p>
<p>withdrawal of carbidopa-Levodopa) or carbidopa-levodopa Extended Release. Patients should</p>
<p>be observed carefully if abrupt reduction or discontinuation of carbidopa-levodopa or</p>
<p>carbidopa-levodopa Extended-Release is required, especially if the patient is receiving</p>
<p>neuroleptics. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#warn">WARNINGS</a></span>.)</p>
<p>If general anesthesia is required, therapy may be continued as long as the patient is permitted to take fluids and medication by mouth. When therapy is interrupted temporarily, the patient should be observed for symptoms resembling NMS, and the usual daily dosage may be resumed as soon as the patient is able to take medication orally.</p>
