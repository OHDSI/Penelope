<h2><span class="Bold Italics">Mechanism of Action
</span></h2>
<p class="First">Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets combines glipizide and metformin hydrochloride, two antihyperglycemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action, to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>.</p>
<p>Glipizide appears to lower blood glucose acutely by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets. Extrapancreatic effects may play a part in the mechanism of action of oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic drugs. The mechanism by which glipizide lowers blood glucose during long-term administration has not been clearly established. In man, stimulation of insulin secretion by glipizide in response to a meal is undoubtedly of major importance. Fasting insulin levels are not elevated even on long-term glipizide administration, but the postprandial insulin response continues to be enhanced after at least 6 months of treatment.</p>
<p>Metformin hydrochloride is an antihyperglycemic agent that improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose.Metformin Hydrochloride decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold Italics">Pharmacokinetics
</span></h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption and Bioavailability</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets</span></p>
<p>In a single-dose study in healthy subjects, the glipizide and metformin components of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets 5 mg/500 mg were bioequivalent to coadministered GLUCOTROL<span class="Sup">®</span> and GLUCOPHAGE<span class="Sup">®</span>. Following administration of a single Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets 5 mg/500 mg tablet in healthy subjects with either a 20% glucose solution or a 20% glucose solution with food, there was a small effect of food on peak plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) and no effect of food on area under the curve (AUC) of the glipizide component. Time to peak plasma concentration (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) for the glipizide component was delayed 1 hour with food relative to the same tablet strength administered fasting with a 20% glucose solution. C<span class="Sub">max</span> for the Metformin component was reduced approximately 14% by food whereas AUC was not affected. T<span class="Sub">max </span>for the Metformin component was delayed 1 hour after food.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Glipizide</span></p>
<p>Gastrointestinal absorption of glipizide is uniform, rapid, and essentially complete. Peak plasma concentrations occur 1 to 3 hours after a single oral dose. glipizide does not accumulate in plasma on repeated oral administration. Total absorption and disposition of an oral dose was unaffected by food in normal volunteers, but absorption was delayed by about 40 minutes.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Metformin Hydrochloride</span></p>
<p>The absolute bioavailability of a 500 mg metformin Hydrochloride tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50% to 60%. Studies using single oral doses of metformin tablets of 500 mg and 1500 mg, and 850 mg to 2550 mg, indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination. Food decreases the extent of and slightly delays the absorption of metformin, as shown by approximately a 40% lower peak concentration and a 25% lower AUC in plasma and a 35-minute prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration following administration of a single 850 mg tablet of metformin with food, compared to the same tablet strength administered fasting. The clinical relevance of these decreases is unknown.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Glipizide</span></p>
<p>Protein binding was studied in serum from volunteers who received either oral or intravenous glipizide and found to be 98% to 99% one hour after either route of administration. The apparent volume of distribution of glipizide after intravenous administration was 11 liters, indicative of localization within the extracellular fluid compartment. In mice, no glipizide or metabolites were detectable autoradiographically in the brain or spinal cord of males or females, nor in the fetuses of pregnant females. In another study, however, very small amounts of radioactivity were detected in the fetuses of rats given labeled drug.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Metformin Hydrochloride</span></p>
<p>The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of 850 mg averaged 654±358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin, steady state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24 to 48 hours and are generally &lt;1 μg/mL. During controlled clinical trials, maximum metformin plasma levels did not exceed 5 μg/mL, even at maximum doses.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Metabolism and Elimination</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Glipizide</span></p>
<p>The metabolism of glipizide is extensive and occurs mainly in the liver. The primary metabolites are inactive hydroxylation products and polar conjugates, and are excreted mainly in the urine. Less than 10% unchanged glipizide is found in the urine. The halflife of elimination ranges from 2 to 4 hours in normal subjects, whether given intravenously or orally. The metabolic and excretory patterns are similar with the two routes of administration, indicating that first-pass metabolism is not significant.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Metformin Hydrochloride</span></p>
<p>Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion. Renal clearance (see Table 1) is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> may be a compartment of distribution.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Special Populations</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Patients With Type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">Diabetes</span></span></p>
<p>In the presence of normal renal function, there are no differences between single- or multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of metformin between patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> and normal subjects (see <a href="#b5991e7e-4be4-4468-bb23-a444cb970eaa">Table 1</a>), nor is there any accumulation of metformin in either group at usual clinical doses.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">Hepatic Insufficiency</span></span></p>
<p>The metabolism and excretion of glipizide may be slowed in patients with impaired hepatic function (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>). No pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic insufficiency</span> for metformin.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span></span></p>
<p>The metabolism and excretion of glipizide may be slowed in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>).</p>
<p>In patients with decreased renal function (based on creatinine clearance), the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased in proportion to the decrease in creatinine clearance (see <a href="#b5991e7e-4be4-4468-bb23-a444cb970eaa">Table 1</a>; also, see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Geriatrics</span></p>
<p>There is no information on the pharmacokinetics of glipizide in elderly patients.  Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and C<span class="Sub">max</span> is increased, compared to healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function (see <a href="#b5991e7e-4be4-4468-bb23-a444cb970eaa">Table 1</a>). Metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced.</p>

<p>After 24 weeks, treatment with Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets 2.5 mg/250 mg and 2.5 mg/500 mg resulted in significantly greater reduction in HbA<span class="Sub">1c </span>compared to glipizide and to metformin therapy. Also, Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets 2.5 mg/250 mg therapy resulted in significant reductions in FPG versus metformin therapy. Increases above fasting glucose and insulin levels were determined at baseline and final study visits by measurement of plasma glucose and insulin for three hours following a standard mixed liquid meal. Treatment with Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets lowered the three-hour postprandial glucose AUC, compared to baseline, to a significantly greater extent than did the glipizide and the metformin therapies. Compared to baseline, Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets enhanced the postprandial insulin response, but did not significantly affect fasting insulin levels.</p>
<p>There were no clinically meaningful differences in changes from baseline for all lipid parameters between Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets therapy and either metformin therapy or glipizide therapy. The adjusted mean changes from baseline in body weight were: Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets 2.5 mg/250 mg, -0.4 kg; Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets.2.5 mg/500 mg, -0.5 kg; glipizide, -0.2 kg; and metformin, -1.9 kg. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">Weight loss</span> was greater with metformin than with Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets.</p>

The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span> increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span> may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span>.

<h1><span class="Bold">SPECIAL WARNING ON INCREASED RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY
</span></h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">The administration of oral hypoglycemic drugs has been reported to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality as compared to treatment with diet alone or diet plus insulin. This warning is based on the study conducted by the University Group <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">Diabetes</span> Program (UGDP), a long-term prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of glucose-lowering drugs in preventing or delaying vascular complications in patients with non-insulin-dependent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>. The study involved 823 patients who were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups (</span><span class="Bold Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">Diabetes</span> </span><span class="Bold">19 (Suppl. 2):747-830, 1970).</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">UGDP reported that patients treated for 5 to 8 years with diet plus a fixed dose of tolbutamide (1.5 grams per day) had a rate of cardiovascular mortality approximately 2½ times that of patients treated with diet alone. A significant increase in total mortality was not observed, but the use of tolbutamide was discontinued based on the increase in cardiovascular mortality, thus limiting the opportunity for the study to show an increase in overall mortality. Despite controversy regarding the interpretation of these results, the findings of the UGDP study provide an adequate basis for this warning. The patient should be informed of the potential risks and benefits of glipizide and of alternative modes of therapy.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Although only one drug in the sulfonylurea class (tolbutamide) was included in this study, it is prudent from a safety standpoint to consider that this warning may also apply to other hypoglycemic drugs in this class, in view of their close similarities in mode of action and chemical structure.</span></p>

<p>Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets is capable of producing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>; therefore, proper patient selection, dosing, and instructions are important to avoid potential <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemic episodes</span>. The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> is increased when caloric intake is deficient, when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplementation, or during concomitant use with other glucose-lowering agents or ethanol. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal insufficiency</span> may cause elevated drug levels of both Glipizide and Metformin Hydrochloride. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">Hepatic insufficiency</span> may increase drug levels of glipizide and may also diminish gluconeogenic capacity, both of which increase the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemic reactions</span>. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients and those with adrenal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254542" conceptname="Hypopituitarism">pituitary insufficiency</span> or alcohol <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">Hypoglycemia</span> may be difficult to recognize in the elderly, and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs.</p>

<p>The metabolism and excretion of glipizide may be slowed in patients with impaired renal and/or hepatic function. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> should occur in such patients, it may be prolonged and appropriate management should be instituted.</p>

<p>Treatment of patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency with sulfonylurea agents can lead to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435503" conceptname="Hemolytic anemia">hemolytic anemia</span>. Because Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets belongs to the class of sulfonylurea agents, caution should be used in patients with G6PD deficiency and a non-sulfonylurea alternative should be considered. In postmarketing reports, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435503" conceptname="Hemolytic anemia">hemolytic anemia</span> has also been reported in patients who did not have known G6PD deficiency.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Metformin Hydrochloride</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Monitoring of renal function</span></p>
<p>Metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of Metformin accumulation and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span> increases with the degree of impairment of renal function. Thus, patients with serum creatinine levels above the upper limit of normal for their age should not receive Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets. In patients with advanced age, Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets should be carefully titrated to establish the minimum dose for adequate glycemic effect, because aging is associated with reduced renal function. In elderly patients, particularly those ≥80 years of age, renal function should be monitored regularly and, generally, Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets should not be titrated to the maximum dose (see <a href="#bacc16a2-6c20-45c2-9fef-f3f2dcf63390">WARNINGS</a> and <a href="#bf7b4937-ec4c-48a5-8e3b-0a0605326ef7">DOSAGE </a><a href="#bf7b4937-ec4c-48a5-8e3b-0a0605326ef7">AND ADMINISTRATION</a>). Before initiation of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets therapy and at least annually thereafter, renal function should be assessed and verified as normal. In patients in whom development of renal dysfunction is anticipated, renal function should be assessed more frequently and Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets discontinued if evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> is present.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Use of concomitant medications that may affect renal function or metformin disposition</span></p>
<p>Concomitant medication(s) that may affect renal function or result in significant hemodynamic change or may interfere with the disposition of metformin, such as cationic drugs that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion (see <a href="#baf06dab-d0fe-4881-8aec-94c708687b46">PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions</a>), should be used with caution.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Radiologic studies involving the use of intravascular iodinated contrast materials (for example, intravenous urogram, intravenous cholangiography, angiography, and computed tomography (CT) scans with intravascular contrast materials)</span></p>
<p>Intravascular contrast studies with iodinated materials can lead to acute alteration of renal function and have been associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span> in patients receiving Metformin (see <a href="#be2aede4-f881-41ab-87ca-8b1f5be338e9">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>). Therefore, in patients in whom any such study is planned, Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets should be temporarily discontinued at the time of or prior to the procedure, and withheld for 48 hours subsequent to the procedure and reinstituted only after renal function has been reevaluated and found to be normal.</p>

When such events occur in patients on Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets therapy, the drug should be promptly discontinued.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Surgical procedures</span></p>
<p>Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets therapy should be temporarily suspended for any surgical procedure (except minor procedures not associated with restricted intake of food and fluids) and should not be restarted until the patient's oral intake has resumed and renal function has been evaluated as normal.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Alcohol intake</span></p>
<p>Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients, therefore, should be warned against excessive alcohol intake, acute or chronic, while receiving Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets. Due to its effect on the gluconeogenic capacity of the liver, alcohol may also increase the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Impaired hepatic function</span></p>
<p>Since impaired hepatic function has been associated with some cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span>, Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Vitamin B</span><span class="Italics"><span class="Sub">12 </span></span><span class="Italics"> levels</span></p>
<p>In controlled clinical trials with metformin of 29 weeks duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span>, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B<span class="Sub">12</span> absorption from the B<span class="Sub">12</span>-intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span> and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> supplementation.</p>
<p>Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on metformin and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed (see <a href="#b809bb91-de77-478a-97ba-1559304ad668">PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests</a>).</p>
<p>Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> levels. In these patients, routine serum vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> measurements at two- to three-year intervals may be useful.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold Italics">Drug Interactions
</span></h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets </span></p>
<p>Certain drugs tend to produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span> and may lead to loss of blood glucose control. These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets, the patient should be closely observed for loss of blood glucose control. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets, the patient should be observed closely for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>.Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins and is, therefore, less likely to interact with highly protein-bound drugs such as salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, and probenecid as compared to sulfonylureas, which are extensively bound to serum proteins.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Glipizide</span></p>
<p>The hypoglycemic action of sulfonylureas may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, some azoles, and other drugs that are highly protein-bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta adrenergic blocking agents. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets, the patient should be observed closely for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets, the patient should be observed closely for loss of blood glucose control. In vitro binding studies with human serum proteins indicate that glipizide binds differently than tolbutamide and does not interact with salicylate or dicumarol. However, caution must be exercised in extrapolating these findings to the clinical situation and in the use of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets with these drugs.</p>
<p>A potential interaction between oral miconazole and oral hypoglycemic agents leading to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> has been reported. Whether this interaction also occurs with the intravenous, topical, or vaginal preparations of miconazole is not known. The effect of concomitant administration of fluconazole and glipizide has been demonstrated in a placebo-controlled crossover study in normal volunteers. All subjects received glipizide alone and following treatment with 100 mg of fluconazole as a single oral daily dose for 7 days, the mean percent increase in the glipizide AUC after fluconazole administration was 56.9% (range: 35% to 81%).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Metformin Hydrochloride</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Furosemide</span></p>
<p>A single-dose, metformin-furosemide drug interaction study in healthy subjects demonstrated that pharmacokinetic parameters of both compounds were affected by coadministration. Furosemide increased the metformin plasma and blood C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 22% and blood AUC by 15%, without any significant change in metformin renal clearance. When administered with metformin, the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of furosemide were 31% and 12% smaller, respectively, than when administered alone, and the terminal half-life was decreased by 32%, without any significant change in furosemide renal clearance. No information is available about the interaction of metformin and furosemide when coadministered chronically.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Nifedipine</span></p>
<p>A single-dose, metformin-nifedipine drug interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that coadministration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount excreted in the urine. T<span class="Sub">max</span> and half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Metformin had minimal effects on nifedipine.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Cationic drugs</span></p>
<p>Cationic drugs (eg, amiloride, digoxin, morphine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine, ranitidine, triamterene, trimethoprim, or vancomycin) that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion theoretically have the potential for interaction with metformin by competing for common renal tubular transport systems. Such interaction between metformin and oral cimetidine has been observed in normal healthy volunteers in both single- and multipledose, metformin-cimetidine drug interaction studies, with a 60% increase in peak metformin plasma and whole blood concentrations and a 40% increase in plasma and whole blood metformin AUC. There was no change in elimination half-life in the singledose study. Metformin had no effect on cimetidine pharmacokinetics. Although such interactions remain theoretical (except for cimetidine), careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets and/or the interfering drug is recommended in patients who are taking cationic medications that are excreted via the proximal renal tubular secretory system.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Other</span></p>
<p>In healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of metformin and propranolol and metformin and ibuprofen were not affected when coadministered in single-dose interaction studies.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">Glipizide</span></p>
<p>A 20-month study in rats and an 18-month study in mice at doses up to 75 times the maximum human dose revealed no evidence of drug-related carcinogenicity.

<p><span class="Bold">Metformin Hydrochloride</span></p>
<p>Long-term carcinogenicity studies were performed with metformin alone in rats (dosing duration of 104 weeks) and mice (dosing duration of 91 weeks) at doses up to and including 900 mg/kg/day and 1500 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are both approximately four times the maximum recommended human daily (MRHD) dose of 2000 mg of the metformin component of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets based on body surface area comparisons. No evidence of carcinogenicity with metformin alone was found in either male or female mice. Similarly, there was no tumorigenic potential observed with metformin alone in male rats. There was, however, an increased incidence of benign stromal uterine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4187628" conceptname="Polyp">polyps</span> in female rats treated with 900 mg/kg/day of metformin alone.</p>

Results in the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus test were also negative.</p>
<p>Fertility of male or female rats was unaffected by Metformin alone when administered at doses as high as 600 mg/kg/day, which is approximately three times the MRHD dose of the Metformin component of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets based on body surface area comparisons.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold">Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C
</span></h3>
<p class="First">Recent information strongly suggests that abnormal blood glucose levels during pregnancy are associated with a higher incidence of congenital abnormalities. Most experts recommend that insulin be used during pregnancy to maintain blood glucose as close to normal as possible. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly needed. (See below.)</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women with Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets or its individual components. No animal studies have been conducted with the combined products in Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets. The following data are based on findings in studies performed with the individual products.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Glipizide</span></p>
<p>Glipizide was found to be mildly fetotoxic in rat reproductive studies at all dose levels (5-50 mg/kg). This fetotoxicity has been similarly noted with other sulfonylureas, such as tolbutamide and tolazamide. The effect is perinatal and believed to be directly related to the pharmacologic (hypoglycemic) action of glipizide. In studies in rats and rabbits, no teratogenic effects were found.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Metformin Hydrochloride</span></p>
<p>Metformin alone was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day. This represents an exposure of about two and six times the MRHD dose of 2000 mg of the metformin component of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets based on body surface area comparisons for rats and rabbits, respectively. Determination of fetal concentrations demonstrated a partial placental barrier to metformin.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold">Nonteratogenic Effects

<p class="First">Prolonged severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> (4 to 10 days) has been reported in neonates born to mothers who were receiving a sulfonylurea drug at the time of delivery. This has been reported more frequently with the use of agents with prolonged half-lives. It is not recommended that Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets be used during pregnancy. However, if it is used, Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets should be discontinued at least one month before the expected delivery date.

<h2><span class="Bold Italics">Nursing Mothers

<p class="First">Although it is not known whether Glipizide is excreted in human milk, some sulfonylurea drugs are known to be excreted in human milk. Studies in lactating rats show that metformin is excreted into milk and reaches levels comparable to those in plasma. Similar studies have not been conducted in nursing mothers.</p>
<p>Because the potential for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> in nursing infants may exist, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. If Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets is discontinued, and if diet alone is inadequate for controlling blood glucose, insulin therapy should be considered.</p>

<p class="First">Of the 345 patients who received Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets 2.5 mg/250 mg and 2.5 mg/500 mg in the initial therapy trial, 67 (19.4%) were aged 65 and older while 5 (1.4%) were aged 75 and older. Of the 87 patients who received Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets in the second-line therapy trial, 17 (19.5%) were aged 65 and older while one (1.1%) was at least aged 75. No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between these patients and younger patients in either the initial therapy trial or the second-line therapy trial, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>Metformin hydrochloride is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and because the risk of serious adverse reactions to the drug is greater in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>, Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets should only be used in patients with normal renal function (see <a href="#be2aede4-f881-41ab-87ca-8b1f5be338e9">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>, <a href="#bacc16a2-6c20-45c2-9fef-f3f2dcf63390">WARNINGS</a>, and <a href="#b3796827-a6ea-4ae4-b5a7-97d85f19a3f4">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics</a>). Because aging is associated with reduced renal function, Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets should be used with caution as age increases. Care should be taken in dose selection and should be based on careful and regular monitoring of renal function. Generally, elderly patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets (see also <a href="#bacc16a2-6c20-45c2-9fef-f3f2dcf63390">WARNINGS</a> and <a href="#bf7b4937-ec4c-48a5-8e3b-0a0605326ef7">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</span></h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">General Considerations</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Dosage of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 20 mg glipizide/2000 mg metformin.</span> Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets should be given with meals and should be initiated at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation as described below, in order to avoid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> (largely due to glipizide), to reduce GI side effects (largely due to metformin), and to permit determination of the minimum effective dose for adequate control of blood glucose for the individual patient.</p>
<p>With initial treatment and during dose titration, appropriate blood glucose monitoring should be used to determine the therapeutic response to Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets and to identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, HbA<span class="Sub">1c </span>should be measured at intervals of approximately 3 months to assess the effectiveness of therapy. The therapeutic goal in all patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> is to decrease FPG, PPG, and HbA1c to normal or as near normal as possible.</p>
<p>Ideally, the response to therapy should be evaluated using HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4123836" conceptname="Glycosylated hemoglobin">glycosylated hemoglobin</span>), which is a better indicator of longterm glycemic control than FPG alone.</p>
<p>No studies have been performed specifically examining the safety and efficacy of switching to Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets therapy in patients taking concomitant glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) plus metformin. Changes in glycemic control may occur in such patients, with either <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> possible. Any change in therapy of type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> should be undertaken with care and appropriate monitoring.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets as Initial Therapy</span></p>
<p>For patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> whose <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span> cannot be satisfactorily managed with diet and exercise alone, the recommended starting dose of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets is 2.5 mg/250 mg once a day with a meal. For patients whose FPG is 280 mg/dL to 320 mg/dL a starting dose of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets 2.5 mg/500 mg twice daily should be considered. The efficacy of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets in patients whose FPG exceeds 320 mg/dL has not been established. Dosage increases to achieve adequate glycemic control should be made in increments of one tablet per day every two weeks up to maximum of 10 mg/1000 mg or 10 mg/2000 mg Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets per day given in divided doses. In clinical trials of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets as initial therapy, there was no experience with total daily doses greater than 10 mg/2000 mg per day.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets as Second-Line Therapy</span></p>
<p>For patients not adequately controlled on either glipizide (or another sulfonylurea) or metformin alone, the recommended starting dose of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets is 2.5 mg/500 mg or 5 mg/500 mg twice daily with the morning and evening meals. In order to avoid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>, the starting dose of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets should not exceed the daily doses of Glipizide or metformin already being taken. The daily dose should be titrated in increments of no more than 5 mg/500 mg up to the minimum effective dose to achieve adequate control of blood glucose or to a maximum dose of 20 mg/2000 mg per day.</p>
<p>Patients previously treated with combination therapy of glipizide (or another sulfonylurea) plus metformin may be switched to Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets 2.5 mg/500 mg or 5 mg/500 mg; the starting dose should not exceed the daily dose of Glipizide (or equivalent dose of another sulfonylurea) and metformin already being taken. The decision to switch to the nearest equivalent dose or to titrate should be based on clinical judgment. Patients should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> following such a switch and the dose of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets should be titrated as described above to achieve adequate control of blood glucose.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Specific Patient Populations</span></p>
<p>Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets is not recommended for use during pregnancy or for use in pediatric patients. The initial and maintenance dosing of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets should be conservative in patients with advanced age, due to the potential for decreased renal function in this population. Any dosage adjustment requires a careful assessment of renal function. Generally, elderly, debilitated, and malnourished patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets to avoid the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. Monitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of metformin-associated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span>, particularly in the elderly.

Most people with kidney problems should not take Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets. (See Question Nos. 9-13.) </span></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><span class="Bold">Q1. Why do I need to take Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets?</span></p>
<p>Your doctor has prescribed Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets to treat your type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>. This is also known as non-insulin-dependent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Q2. What is type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>?</span></p>
<p>People with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> are not able to make enough insulin and/or respond normally to the insulin their body does make. When this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. This can lead to serious medical problems including kidney damage, amputations, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377551" conceptname="Blind hypertensive eye">blindness</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">Diabetes</span> is also closely linked to heart disease. The main goal of treating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> is to lower your blood sugar to a normal level.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Q3. Why is it important to control type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>?</span></p>
<p>The main goal of treating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> is to lower your blood sugar to a normal level. Studies have shown that good control of blood sugar may prevent or delay complications such as heart disease, kidney disease, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377551" conceptname="Blind hypertensive eye">blindness</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Q4. How is type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> usually controlled?</span></p>
<p>High blood sugar can be lowered by diet and exercise, by a number of oral medications, and by insulin injections. Before taking Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets you should first try to control your <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> by exercise and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span>. Even if you are taking Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets, you should still exercise and follow the diet recommended for your <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Q5. Does Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets work differently from other glucosecontrol medications?</span></p>
<p>Yes it does. Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets combines two glucose-lowering drugs, glipizide and metformin. These two drugs work together to improve the different metabolic defects found in type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>. Glipizide lowers blood sugar primarily by causing more of the body’s own insulin to be released, and metformin lowers blood sugar, in part, by helping your body use your own insulin more effectively. Together, they are efficient in helping you achieve better glucose control.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Q6. What happens if my blood sugar is still too high?</span></p>
<p>When blood sugar cannot be lowered enough by Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets, your doctor may prescribe injectable insulin or take other measures to control your <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Q7. Can Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets cause side effects?</span></p>
<p>Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets, like all blood sugar-lowering medications, can cause side effects in some patients. Most of these side effects are minor. However, there are also serious, but rare, side effects related to Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets (see <span class="Bold">Question Nos. 9-13</span>).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Q8. What are the most common side effects of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets?</span></p>
<p>The most common side effects of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets are normally minor ones such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012224" conceptname="Upset stomach">upset stomach</span>. If these side effects occur, they usually occur during the first few weeks of therapy. Taking your Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets with meals can help reduce these side effects. Symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> (low blood sugar), such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">lightheadedness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">shakiness</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205415" conceptname="Hungry">hunger</span> may occur. The risk of hypoglycemic symptoms increases when meals are skipped, too much alcohol is consumed, or heavy exercise occurs without enough food. Following the advice of your doctor can help you to avoid these symptoms.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Q9. Are there any serious side effects that Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets can cause?</span></p>
<p>People who have a condition known as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and who take Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets may develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435503" conceptname="Hemolytic anemia">hemolytic anemia</span> (fast breakdown of red blood cells). G6PD deficiency usually runs in families. Tell your doctor if you or any members of your family have been diagnosed with G6PD deficiency before you start taking Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets.</p>
<p>Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets rarely causes serious side effects. The most serious side effect that Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets can cause is called <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Q10. What is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span> and can it happen to me?</span></p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">Lactic acidosis</span> is caused by a buildup of lactic acid in the blood. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">Lactic acidosis</span> associated with metformin is rare and has occurred mostly in people whose kidneys were not working normally. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">Lactic acidosis</span> has been reported in about one in 33,000 patients taking metformin over the course of a year. Although rare, if <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span> does occur, it can be fatal in up to half the cases.</p>
<p>It’s also important for your liver to be working normally when you take Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets.</p>
<p>Your liver helps remove lactic acid from your bloodstream. Your doctor will monitor your <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> and may perform blood tests on you from time to time to make sure your kidneys and your liver are functioning normally.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets causes harm to the kidneys or liver.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Q11. Are there other risk factors for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span>?</span></p>
<p>Your risk of developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span> from taking Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets is very low as long as your kidneys and liver are healthy. However, some factors can increase your risk because they can affect kidney and liver function. You should discuss your risk with your physician.</p>
<p>You should not take Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets if:</p>
<ul class="Disc">
<li>You have chronic kidney or liver problems</li>
<li>You have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span> which is treated with medications, eg, digoxin (Lanoxin<span class="Sup">®</span>) or furosemide (Lasix<span class="Sup">®</span>)</li>
<li>You drink alcohol excessively (all the time or short-term “binge? drinking)</li>
<li>You are seriously dehydrated (have lost a large amount of body fluids)</li>
<li>You are going to have certain x-ray procedures with injectable contrast agents</li>
<li>You are going to have surgery</li>
<li>You develop a serious condition such as a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</span>, severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, or a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span></li>
<li>You are ≥80 years of age and have NOT had your kidney function tested</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Bold">Q12. What are the symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span>?</span></p>
<p>Some of the symptoms include: feeling very weak, tired or uncomfortable, unusual <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442752" conceptname="Muscle pain">muscle pain</span>, trouble breathing, unusual or unexpected <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4152197" conceptname="Stomach ache">stomach discomfort</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4276665" conceptname="Feels cold">feeling cold</span>, feeling dizzy or lightheaded, or suddenly developing a slow or irregular heartbeat. If you notice these symptoms, or if your medical condition has suddenly changed, stop taking Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets and call your doctor right away. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">Lactic acidosis</span> is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Q13. What does my doctor need to know to decrease my risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span>?</span></p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have an illness that results in severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, or if your intake of fluids is significantly reduced. These situations can lead to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435796" conceptname="Dehydration">dehydration</span>, and it may be necessary to stop taking Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets temporarily.</p>
<p>You should let your doctor know if you are going to have any surgery or specialized x-ray procedures that require injection of contrast agents. Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets therapy will need to be stopped temporarily in such instances.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Q14. Can I take Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets with other medications?</span></p>
<p>Remind your doctor that you are taking Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets when any new drug is prescribed or a change is made in how you take a drug already prescribed.</p>
<p>Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets may interfere with the way some drugs work and some drugs may interfere with the action of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Q15. What if I become pregnant while taking Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets?</span></p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you plan to become pregnant or have become pregnant. As with other oral glucose-control medications, you should not take Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Usually your doctor will prescribe insulin while you are pregnant. As with all medications, you and your doctor should discuss the use of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets if you are nursing a child.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Q16. How do I take Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets?</span></p>
<p>Your doctor will tell you how many Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets to take and how often. This should also be printed on the label of your prescription. You will probably be started on a low dose of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets and your dosage will be increased gradually until your blood sugar is controlled.</p>
