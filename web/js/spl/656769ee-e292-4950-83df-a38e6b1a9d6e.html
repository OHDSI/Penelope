<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First"><a name="ID79"></a>Acarbose Tablets are an oral alpha-glucosidase inhibitor for use in the management of type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus. Acarbose is an oligosaccharide which is obtained from fermentation processes of a microorganism, Actinoplanes utahensis, and is chemically known as O-4,6-dideoxy- 4-[[(1<span class="Italics">S</span>,4<span class="Italics">R</span>,5<span class="Italics">S</span>,6<span class="Italics">S</span>)-4,5,6-trihydroxy-3-(hydroxymethyl)-2-cyclohexen-1-yl]amino]- Î±-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 â†’ 4)-O-Î±-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 â†’ 4)-D-glucose. It is a white to off-white powder with a molecular weight of 645.6. Acarbose is soluble in water and has a pK<span class="Sub">a</span> of 5.1. Its empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">25</span>H<span class="Sub">43</span>NO<span class="Sub">18</span> and its chemical structure is as follows: </p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"><a name="ID83"></a>Acarbose is a complex oligosaccharide that delays the digestion of ingested carbohydrates, thereby resulting in a smaller rise in blood glucose concentration following meals. As a consequence of plasma glucose reduction, Acarbose Tablets reduce levels of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4123836" conceptname="Glycosylated hemoglobin">glycosylated hemoglobin</span> in patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus. Systemic non-enzymatic protein glycosylation, as reflected by levels of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4123836" conceptname="Glycosylated hemoglobin">glycosylated hemoglobin</span>, is a function of average blood glucose concentration over time.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="43679-0">
<a name="ID84"></a><a name="section-2.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First"><a name="ID85"></a>In contrast to sulfonylureas, Acarbose Tablets do not enhance insulin secretion. The antihyperglycemic action of acarbose results from a competitive, reversible inhibition of pancreatic alpha-amylase and membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucoside hydrolase enzymes. Pancreatic alpha-amylase hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the lumen of the small intestine, while the membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides, trisaccharides, and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the brush border of the small intestine. In diabetic patients, this enzyme inhibition results in a delayed glucose absorption and a lowering of postprandial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span>.</p>
<p>Because its mechanism of action is different, the effect of Acarbose Tablets to enhance glycemic control is additive to that of sulfonylureas, insulin or metformin when used in combination. In addition, Acarbose Tablets diminish the insulinotropic and weight-increasing effects of sulfonylureas.</p>
<p>Acarbose has no inhibitory activity against lactase and consequently would not be expected to induce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4143342" conceptname="Lactose intolerance">lactose intolerance</span>.</p>

<a name="ID86"></a><a name="section-2.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First"><a name="ID87"></a>Absorption </p>
<p>In a study of 6 healthy men, less than 2% of an oral dose of acarbose was absorbed as active drug, while approximately 35% of total radioactivity from a <span class="Sup">14</span>C-labeled oral dose was absorbed. An average of 51% of an oral dose was excreted in the feces as unabsorbed drug-related radioactivity within 96 hours of ingestion. Because acarbose acts locally within the gastrointestinal tract, this low systemic bioavailability of parent compound is therapeutically desired. Following oral dosing of healthy volunteers with <span class="Sup">14</span>C-labeled acarbose, peak plasma concentrations of radioactivity were attained 14-24 hours after dosing, while peak plasma concentrations of active drug were attained at approximately 1 hour. The delayed absorption of acarbose-related radioactivity reflects the absorption of metabolites that may be formed by either intestinal bacteria or intestinal enzymatic hydrolysis.</p>
<p>Metabolism</p>
<p>Acarbose is metabolized exclusively within the gastrointestinal tract, principally by intestinal bacteria, but also by digestive enzymes. A fraction of these metabolites (approximately 34% of the dose) was absorbed and subsequently excreted in the urine. At least 13 metabolites have been separated chromatographically from urine specimens. The major metabolites have been identified as 4-methylpyrogallol derivatives (that is, sulfate, methyl, and glucuronide conjugates). One metabolite (formed by cleavage of a glucose molecule from acarbose) also has alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity. This metabolite, together with the parent compound, recovered from the urine, accounts for less than 2% of the total administered dose.</p>
<p>Excretion</p>
<p>The fraction of acarbose that is absorbed as intact drug is almost completely excreted by the kidneys. When acarbose was given intravenously, 89% of the dose was recovered in the urine as active drug within 48 hours. In contrast, less than 2% of an oral dose was recovered in the urine as active (that is, parent compound and active metabolite) drug. This is consistent with the low bioavailability of the parent drug. The plasma elimination half-life of acarbose activity is approximately 2 hours in healthy volunteers. Consequently, drug accumulation does not occur with three times a day (t.i.d.) oral dosing.</p>
<p>Special Populations </p>
<p>The mean steady-state area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentrations of acarbose were approximately 1.5 times higher in elderly compared to young volunteers; however, these differences were not statistically significant. Patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (Clcr &lt; 25 mL/min/1.73m<span class="Sup">2</span>) attained about 5 times higher peak plasma concentrations of acarbose and 6 times larger AUCs than volunteers with normal renal function. No studies of acarbose pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have been performed. In U.S. controlled clinical studies of Acarbose Tablets in patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus, reductions in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4123836" conceptname="Glycosylated hemoglobin">glycosylated hemoglobin</span> levels were similar in Caucasians (n=478) and African-Americans (n=167), with a trend toward a better response in Latinos (n=132).</p>

<h2>Drug-Drug Interactions:</h2>
<p class="First"><a name="ID89"></a>Studies in healthy volunteers have shown that Acarbose Tablets have no effect on either the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of nifedipine, propranolol, or ranitidine. Acarbose Tablets did not interfere with the absorption or disposition of the sulfonylurea glyburide in diabetic patients. Acarbose Tablets may affect digoxin bioavailability and may require dose adjustment of digoxin by 16% (90% confidence interval: 8-23%), decrease mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> of digoxin by 26% (90% confidence interval: 16-34%) and decreases mean trough concentrations of digoxin by 9% (90% confidence limit: 19% decrease to 2% increase). (See PRECAUTIONS, <a href="#ID105">Drug Interactions</a>.)</p>
<p>The amount of metformin absorbed while taking Acarbose Tablets was bioequivalent to the amount absorbed when taking placebo, as indicated by the plasma AUC values. However, the peak plasma level of metformin was reduced by approximately 20% when taking Acarbose Tablets due to a slight delay in the absorption of metformin. There is little if any clinically significant interaction between Acarbose Tablets and metformin.</p>

<p>** The 300 mg t.i.d. Acarbose Tablets regimen was superior to lower doses, but there were no statistically significant differences from 50 to 200 mg t.i.d. </p>
<p>Clinical Experience in Type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">Diabetes</span> Mellitus Patients on Monotherapy, or in Combination with Sulfonylureas, Metformin or Insulin: Acarbose Tablets were studied as monotherapy and as combination therapy to sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin treatment. The treatment effects on HbA1c levels and one-hour postprandial glucose levels are summarized for four placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized studies conducted in the United States in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. The placebo-subtracted treatment differences, which are summarized below, were statistically significant for both variables in all of these studies.</p>
<p>Study 1 (n=109) involved patients on background treatment with diet only. The mean effect of the addition of Acarbose Tablets to diet therapy was a change in HbA1c of â€‘0.78%, and an improvement of one-hour postprandial glucose of -74.4 mg/dL.</p>
<p>In Study 2 (n=137), the mean effect of the addition of Acarbose Tablets to maximum sulfonylurea therapy was a change in HbA1c of -0.54%, and an improvement of one-hour postprandial glucose of -33.5 mg/dL.</p>
<p>In Study 3 (n=147), the mean effect of the addition of Acarbose Tablets to maximum metformin therapy was a change in HbA1c of -0.65%, and an improvement of one-hour postprandial glucose of -34.3 mg/dL.</p>
<p>Study 4 (n=145) demonstrated that Acarbose Tablets added to patients on background treatment with insulin resulted in a mean change in HbA1c of -0.69%, and an improvement of one-hour postprandial glucose of -36.0 mg/dL.</p>
<p>A one year study of Acarbose Tablets as monotherapy or in combination with sulfonylurea, metformin or insulin treatment was conducted in Canada in which 316 patients were included in the primary efficacy analysis (Figure 2). In the diet, sulfonylurea and metformin groups, the mean decrease in HbA1c produced by the addition of Acarbose Tablets was statistically significant at six months, and this effect was persistent at one year. In the Acarbose Tablets-treated patients on insulin, there was a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c at six months, and a trend for a reduction at one year.</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"><a name="ID104"></a><span class="Bold">General</span></p>
<p>Macrovascular Outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with Acarbose Tablets or any other anti-diabetic drug.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">Hypoglycemia</span>: Because of their mechanism of action, Acarbose Tablets when administered alone should not cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> in the fasted or postprandial state. Sulfonylurea agents or insulin may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. Because Acarbose Tablets given in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin will cause a further lowering of blood glucose, it may increase the potential for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">Hypoglycemia</span> does not occur in patients receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use, and no increased incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> was observed in patients when Acarbose Tablets were added to metformin therapy. Oral glucose (dextrose), whose absorption is not inhibited by Acarbose Tablets, should be used instead of sucrose (cane sugar) in the treatment of mild to moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. Sucrose, whose hydrolysis to glucose and fructose is inhibited by Acarbose Tablets, is unsuitable for the rapid correction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. Severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> may require the use of either intravenous glucose infusion or glucagonÂ injection.</p>
<p>Elevated Serum Transaminase Levels: In long-term studies (up to 12 months, and including Acarbose Tablets doses up to 300 mg t.i.d.) conducted in the United States, treatment-emergent elevations of serum transaminases (AST and/or ALT) above the upper limit of normal (ULN), greater than 1.8 times the ULN, and greater than 3 times the ULN occurred in 14%, 6%, and 3%, respectively, of Acarbose Tablets-treated patients as compared to 7%, 2%, and 1%, respectively, of placebo-treated patients. Although these differences between treatments were statistically significant, these elevations were asymptomatic, reversible, more common in females, and, in general, were not associated with other evidence of liver dysfunction. In addition, these serum transaminase elevations appeared to be dose related. In US studies including Acarbose Tablets doses up to the maximum approved dose of 100 mg t.i.d., treatment-emergent elevations of AST and/or ALT at any level of severity were similar between Acarbose Tablets-treated patients and placebo-treated patients (p â‰¥ 0.496).</p>
<p>In approximately 3 million patient-years of international postmarketing experience with Acarbose Tablets, 62 cases of serum transaminase elevations &gt; 500 IU/L (29 of which were associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span>) have been reported. Forty-one of these 62 patients received treatment with 100 mg t.i.d. or greater and 33 of 45 patients for whom weight was reported weighed &lt; 60 kg. In the 59 cases where follow-up was recorded, hepatic abnormalities improved or resolved upon discontinuation of Acarbose Tablets in 55 and were unchanged in two. Cases of fulminant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> with fatal outcome have been reported; the relationship to acarbose is unclear.</p>
<p>Loss of Control of Blood Glucose: When diabetic patients are exposed to stress such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433633" conceptname="Late effect of superficial injury">trauma</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, or surgery, a temporary loss of control of blood glucose may occur. At such times, temporary insulin therapy may be necessary.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Information for Patients: </span>Patients should be told to take Acarbose Tablets orally three times a day at the start (with the first bite) of each main meal. It is important that patients continue to adhere to dietary instructions, a regular exercise program, and regular testing of urine and/or blood glucose.</p>
<p>Acarbose Tablets themselves do not cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> even when administered to patients in the fasted state. Sulfonylurea drugs and insulin, however, can lower blood sugar levels enough to cause symptoms or sometimes life-threatening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. Because Acarbose Tablets given in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin will cause a further lowering of blood sugar, it may increase the hypoglycemic potential of these agents. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">Hypoglycemia</span> does not occur in patients receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use, and no increased incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> was observed in patients when Acarbose Tablets were added to metformin therapy. The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>, its symptoms and treatment, and conditions that predispose to its development should be well understood by patients and responsible family members. Because Acarbose Tablets prevent the breakdown of table sugar, patients should have a readily available source of glucose (dextrose, D-glucose) to treat symptoms of low blood sugar when taking Acarbose Tablets in combinationÂ withÂ aÂ sulfonylureaÂ orÂ insulin.</p>
<p>If side effects occur with Acarbose Tablets, they usually develop during the first few weeks of therapy. They are most commonly mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal effects, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012503" conceptname="Excessive upper gastrointestinal gas">flatulence</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4183041" conceptname="Abdominal discomfort">abdominal discomfort</span>, and generally diminish in frequency and intensity with time.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Laboratory Tests: </span>Therapeutic response to Acarbose Tablets should be monitored by periodic blood glucose tests. Measurement of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4123836" conceptname="Glycosylated hemoglobin">glycosylated hemoglobin</span> levels is recommended for the monitoringÂ ofÂ long-termÂ glycemicÂ control.</p>
<p>Acarbose Tablets, particularly at doses in excess of 50 mg t.i.d., may give rise to elevations of serum transaminases and, in rare instances, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4032334" conceptname="Hyperbilirubinemia">hyperbilirubinemia</span>. It is recommended that serum transaminase levels be checked every 3 months during the first year of treatment with Acarbose Tablets and periodically thereafter. If elevated transaminases are observed, a reduction in dosage or withdrawal of therapy may be indicated, particularly if the elevations persist.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal Impairment</span>: </span>Plasma concentrations of Acarbose Tablets in renally impaired volunteers were proportionally increased relative to the degree of renal dysfunction. Long-term clinical trials in diabetic patients with significant renal dysfunction (serum creatinine &gt;Â 2.0 mg/dL) have not been conducted. Therefore, treatment of these patients with Acarbose Tablets is not recommended.</p>

<h1>DRUG INTERACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"><a name="ID106"></a>Certain drugs tend to produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span> and may lead to loss of blood glucose control. These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel-blocking drugs, and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving Acarbose Tablets, the patient should be closely observed for loss of blood glucose control. When such drugs are withdrawn from patients receiving Acarbose Tablets in combination with sulfonylureas or insulin, patients should be observed closely for any evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Patients Receiving Sulfonylureas or Insulin</span>: Sulfonylurea agents or insulin may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. Acarbose Tablets given in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin may cause a further lowering of blood glucose and may increase the potential for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> occurs, appropriate adjustments in the dosage of these agents should be made. Very rarely, individual cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232212" conceptname="Hypoglycemic shock">hypoglycemic shock</span> have been reported in patients receiving Acarbose Tablets therapy in combination with sulfonylureas and/or insulin.</p>
<p>Intestinal adsorbents (for example, charcoal) and digestive enzyme preparations containing carbohydrate-splitting enzymes (for example, amylase, pancreatin) may reduce the effect of Acarbose Tablets and should not be taken concomitantly.</p>
<p>Acarbose Tablets have been shown to change the bioavailability of digoxin when they are coadministered, which may require digoxin dose adjustment. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, <a href="#ID88">Drug-Drug Interactions</a>.)</p>

<h1>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS AND IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY</h1>
<p class="First"><a name="ID108"></a>Eight carcinogenicity studies were conducted with acarbose. Six studies were performed in rats (two <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span>, Sprague-Dawley and Wistar) and two studies were performed in hamsters.</p>
<p>In the first rat study, Sprague-Dawley rats received acarbose in feed at high doses (up to approximately 500 mg/kg body weight) for 104 weeks. Acarbose treatment resulted in a significant increase in the incidence of renal tumors (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> and adenocarcinomas) and benign Leydig cell tumors. This study was repeated with a similar outcome. Further studies were performed to separate direct carcinogenic effects of acarbose from indirect effects resulting from the carbohydrate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090739" conceptname="Nutritional disorder">malnutrition</span> induced by the large doses of acarbose employed in the studies. In one study using Sprague-Dawley rats, acarbose was mixed with feed but carbohydrate deprivation was prevented by the addition of glucose to the diet. In a 26-month study of Sprague-Dawley rats, acarbose was administered by daily postprandial gavage so as to avoid the pharmacologic effects of the drug. In both of these studies, the increased incidence of renal tumors found in the original studies did not occur. Acarbose was also given in food and by postprandial gavage in two separate studies in Wistar rats. No increased incidence of renal tumors was found in either of these Wistar rat studies. In two feeding studies of hamsters, with and without glucose supplementation, there was also no evidence of carcinogenicity.</p>
<p>Acarbose did not induce any DNA damage in vitro in the CHO chromosomal aberration assay, bacterial mutagenesis (Ames) assay, or a DNA binding assay. In vivo, no DNA damage was detected in the dominant lethal test in male mice, or the mouse micronucleus test.</p>
<p>Fertility studies conducted in rats after oral administration produced no untoward effect on fertility or on the overall capability to reproduce.</p>

<p class="First"><a name="ID110"></a>Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B. The safety of Acarbose Tablets in pregnant women has not been established. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at doses up to 480 mg/kg (corresponding to 9 times the exposure in humans, based on drug blood levels) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to acarbose. In rabbits, reduced maternal body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span>, probably the result of the pharmacodynamic activity of high doses of acarbose in the intestines, may have been responsible for a slight increase in the number of embryonic losses. However, rabbits given 160 mg/kg acarbose (corresponding to 10 times the dose in man, based on body surface area) showed no evidence of embryotoxicity and there was no evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> at a dose 32 times the dose in man (based on body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies of Acarbose Tablets in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of the human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because current information strongly suggests that abnormal blood glucose levels during pregnancy are associated with a higher incidence of congenital anomalies as well as increased neonatal morbidity and mortality, most experts recommend that insulin be used during pregnancy to maintain blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible.</p>
<p>Nursing Mothers: A small amount of radioactivity has been found in the milk of lactating rats after administration of radiolabeled acarbose. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, Acarbose Tablets should not be administered to a nursing woman.</p>
<p>Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of Acarbose Tablets in pediatric patients have not been established.</p>
<p>Geriatric Use: Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of Acarbose Tablets in the United States, 27% were 65 and over, while 4% were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. The mean steady-state area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentrations of acarbose were approximately 1.5 times higher in elderly compared to young volunteers; however, these differences were not statistically significant.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"><a name="ID112"></a>Digestive Tract: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302537" conceptname="Digestive system finding">Gastrointestinal symptoms</span> are the most common reactions to Acarbose Tablets. In   U.S. placebo-controlled trials, the incidences of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012503" conceptname="Excessive upper gastrointestinal gas">flatulence</span> were 19%, 31%, and 74% respectively in 1255 patients treated with Acarbose Tablets 50-300 mg t.i.d., whereas the corresponding incidences were 9%, 12%, and 29% in 999 placebo-treated patients.</p>
<p>In a one-year safety study, during which patients kept diaries of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302537" conceptname="Digestive system finding">gastrointestinal symptoms</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal pain</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span> tended to return to pretreatment levels over time, and the frequency and intensity of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012503" conceptname="Excessive upper gastrointestinal gas">flatulence</span> tended to abate with time. The increased gastrointestinal tract symptoms in patients treated with Acarbose Tablets are a manifestation of the mechanism of action of Acarbose Tablets and are related to the presence of undigested carbohydrate in the lower GI tract. </p>
<p>If the prescribed diet is not observed, the intestinal side effects may be intensified. If strongly distressing symptoms develop in spite of adherence to the diabetic diet prescribed, the doctor must be consulted and the dose temporarily or permanently reduced.</p>
<p>Elevated Serum Transaminase Levels: </p>
<p>See <a href="#ID103">PRECAUTIONS</a>.</p>
<p>Other Abnormal Laboratory Findings: Small reductions in hematocrit occurred more often in Acarbose Tablets-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients but were not associated with reductions in hemoglobin. Low serum calcium and low plasma vitamin B<span class="Sub">6</span> levels were associated with Acarbose Tablets therapy but are thought to be either spurious or of no clinical significance.</p>

<a name="ID115"></a><a name="section-12"></a><p></p>
<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First"><a name="ID116"></a>There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus with Acarbose Tablets or any other pharmacologic agent. Dosage of Acarbose Tablets must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance while not exceeding the maximum recommended dose of 100 mg t.i.d. Acarbose Tablets should be taken three times daily at the start (with the first bite) of each main meal. Acarbose Tablets should be started at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation as described below, both to reduce gastrointestinal side effects and to permit identification of the minimum dose required for adequate glycemic control of the patient. If the prescribed diet is not observed, the intestinal side effects may be intensified. If strongly distressing symptoms develop in spite of adherence to the diabetic diet prescribed, the doctor must be consulted and the dose temporarily or permanently reduced.</p>
<p>During treatment initiation and dose titration (see below), one-hour postprandial plasma glucose may be used to determine the therapeutic response to Acarbose Tablets and identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4123836" conceptname="Glycosylated hemoglobin">glycosylated hemoglobin</span> should be measured at intervals of approximately three months. The therapeutic goal should be to decrease both postprandial plasma glucose and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4123836" conceptname="Glycosylated hemoglobin">glycosylated hemoglobin</span> levels to normal or near normal by using the lowest effective dose of Acarbose Tablets, either as monotherapy or in combination with sulfonylureas, insulin or metformin.</p>
<p>Initial Dosage: The recommended starting dosage of Acarbose Tablets is 25 mg given orally three times daily at the start (with the first bite) of each main meal. However, some patients may benefit from more gradual dose titration to minimize gastrointestinal side effects. This may be achieved by initiating treatment at 25 mg once per day and subsequently increasing the frequency of administration to achieve 25 mg t.i.d.</p>
<p>Maintenance Dosage: Once a 25 mg t.i.d. dosage regimen is reached, dosage of Acarbose Tablets should be adjusted at 4-8 week intervals based on one-hour postprandial glucose or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4123836" conceptname="Glycosylated hemoglobin">glycosylated hemoglobin</span> levels, and on tolerance. The dosage can be increased from 25 mg t.i.d. to 50 mg t.i.d. Some patients may benefit from further increasing the dosage to 100 mg t.i.d. The maintenance dose ranges from 50 mg t.i.d. to 100 mg t.i.d. However, since patients with low body weight may be at increased risk for elevated serum transaminases, only patients with body weight &gt; 60 kg should be considered for dose titration above 50 mg t.i.d. (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID103">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>). If no further reduction in postprandial glucose or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4123836" conceptname="Glycosylated hemoglobin">glycosylated hemoglobin</span> levels is observed with titration to 100 mg t.i.d., consideration should be given to lowering the dose. Once an effective and tolerated dosage is established, it should be maintained.</p>
<p>Maximum Dosage: The maximum recommended dose for patients â‰¤ 60 kg is 50 mg t.i.d. The maximum recommended dose for patients &gt; 60 kg is 100 mg t.i.d.</p>
<p>Patients Receiving Sulfonylureas or Insulin: Sulfonylurea agents or insulin may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. Acarbose Tablets given in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin will cause a further lowering of blood glucose and may increase the potential for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> occurs, appropriate adjustments in the dosage of these agents should be made.</p>
