<p>Six percent of the 5373 individual subjects exposed to ROZEREM in clinical 
studies discontinued treatment owing to an adverse event, compared with 2% of 
the 2279 subjects receiving placebo. The most frequent adverse events leading to 
discontinuation in subjects receiving ROZEREM were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>,

ROZEREM.</p>
<p>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, 
adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be 
directly compared to rates in clinical trials of other drugs, and may not 
reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from 
clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse 
events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.</p>

<a href="http://"></a><span class="Bold">8.1</span> Â Â Â Â Â  <span class="Bold">Pregnancy</span><p class="First"><span>Pregnancy Category C</span></p>
<p>In animal studies, ramelteon produced evidence of developmental toxicity, 
including teratogenic effects, in rats at doses much greater than the 
recommended human dose (RHD) of 8Â mg/day. There are no adequate and 
well-controlled studies in pregnant women. ROZEREM should be used during 
pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the 
fetus. </p>
<p>Oral administration of ramelteon (10, 40, 150 or 600 mg/kg/day) to pregnant 
rats during the period of organogenesis was associated with increased incidences 
of fetal structural abnormalities (malformations and variations) at doses 
greater than 40 mg/kg/day. The no-effect dose is approximately 50 times the RHD 
on a body surface area (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) basis. Treatment of 
pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis produced no evidence of 
embryo-fetal toxicity at oral doses of up to 300 mg/kg/day (or up to 720 times 
the RHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).</p>
<p>When rats were orally administered ramelteon (30, 100, or 300 mg/kg/day)

<h1>12  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<a href="http://"></a><span class="Bold">12.1</span> Â Â Â Â Â  <span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span><p class="First">ROZEREM (ramelteon) is a melatonin receptor agonist with both 
high affinity for melatonin MT<span class="Sub">1</span> and MT<span class="Sub">2 
</span>receptors and selectivity over the MT<span class="Sub">3</span> receptor. 
Ramelteon demonstrates full agonist activity <span class="Italics">inÂ </span><span class="Italics">vitro</span> in cells expressing human MT<span class="Sub">1</span> 
or MT<span class="Sub">2</span> receptors.</p>
<p>The activity of ramelteon at the MT<span class="Sub">1</span> and MT<span class="Sub">2 </span>receptors is believed to contribute to its sleep-promoting 
properties, as these receptors, acted upon by endogenous melatonin, are thought 
to be involved in the maintenance of the circadian rhythm underlying the normal 
sleep-wake cycle.</p>
<p>Ramelteon has no appreciable affinity for the GABA receptor complex or for 
receptors that bind neuropeptides, cytokines, serotonin, dopamine, 
noradrenaline, acetylcholine, and opiates.Â Ramelteon also does not interfere 
with the activity of a number of selected enzymes in a standard panel.</p>
<p>The major metabolite of ramelteon, M-II, is active and has approximately one 
tenth and one fifth the binding affinity of the parent molecule for the human 
MT<span class="Sub">1</span> and MT<span class="Sub">2</span> receptors, 
respectively, and is 17- to 25-fold less potent than ramelteon in <span class="Italics">inÂ </span><span class="Italics">vitro</span> functional assays. 
Although the potency of M-II at MT<span class="Sub">1</span> and MT<span class="Sub">2</span> receptors is lower than the parent drug, M-II circulates at 
higher concentrations than the parent producing 20- to 100-fold greater mean 
systemic exposure when compared to ramelteon. M-II has weak affinity for the 
serotonin 5-HT<span class="Sub">2B</span> receptor, but no appreciable affinity 
for other receptors or enzymes. Similar to ramelteon, M-II does not interfere 
with the activity of a number of endogenous enzymes.</p>
<p>All other known metabolites of ramelteon are inactive.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Bold">12.3</span> Â Â Â Â Â  <span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span><p>The pharmacokinetic profile of ROZEREM has been evaluated in 
healthy subjects as well as in subjects with hepatic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>. When 
administered orally to humans in doses ranging from 4 to 64 mg, ramelteon 
undergoes rapid, high first-pass metabolism, and exhibits linear 
pharmacokinetics. Maximal serum concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) and 
area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) data show substantial intersubject 
variability, consistent with the high first-pass effect; the coefficient of 
variation for these values is approximately 100%. Several metabolites have been 
identified in human serum and urine.</p>
<p><span>Absorption</span></p>
<p>Ramelteon is absorbed rapidly, with median peak concentrations occurring at 
approximately 0.75 hour (range, 0.5 to 1.5 hours) after fasted oral 
administration. Although the total absorption of ramelteon is at least 84%, the 
absolute oral bioavailability is only 1.8% due to extensive first-pass 
metabolism.</p>
<p><span>Distribution</span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> protein binding of ramelteon is 
approximately 82% in human serum, independent of concentration. Binding to 
albumin accounts for most of that binding, since 70% of the drug is bound in 
human serum albumin. Ramelteon is not distributed selectively to red blood 
cells.</p>
<p>Ramelteon has a mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration 
of 73.6Â L, suggesting substantial tissue distribution.</p>
<p><span>Metabolism</span></p>
<p>Metabolism of ramelteon consists primarily of oxidation to hydroxyl and 
carbonyl derivatives, with secondary metabolism producing glucuronide 
conjugates. CYP1A2 is the major isozyme involved in the hepatic metabolism of 
ramelteon; the CYP2C subfamily and CYP3A4 isozymes are also involved to a minor 
degree.</p>
<p>The rank order of the principal metabolites by prevalence in human serum is 
M-II, M-IV, M-I, and M-III. These metabolites are formed rapidly and exhibit a 
monophasic decline and rapid elimination. The overall mean systemic exposure of 
M-II is approximately 20- to 100-fold higher than parent drug.</p>
<p><span>Elimination</span></p>
<p>Following oral administration of radiolabeled ramelteon, 84% of total 
radioactivity was excreted in urine and approximately 4% in feces, resulting in 
a mean recovery of 88%. Less than 0.1% of the dose was excreted in urine and 
feces as the parent compound. Elimination was essentially complete by 96 hours 
post-dose.</p>
<p>Repeated once daily dosing with ROZEREM does not result in significant 
accumulation owing to the short elimination half-life of ramelteon (on average, 
approximately 1- 2.6 hours).</p>
<p>The half-life of M-II is 2 to 5 hours and independent of dose. Serum 
concentrations of the parent drug and its metabolites in humans are at or below 
the lower limits of quantitation within 24 hours.</p>
<p><span>Effect of Food</span></p>
<p>When administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC<span class="Sub">0-inf</span> 
for a single 16Â mg dose of ROZEREM was 31% higher and the C<span class="Sub">max</span> was 22% lower than when given in a fasted state. Median 
T<span class="Sub">max</span> was delayed by approximately 45 minutes when ROZEREM 
was administered with food. Effects of food on the AUC values for M-II were 
similar. It is therefore recommended that ROZEREM not be taken with or 
immediately after a high-fat meal <span class="Italics">[see </span><span class="Italics"><a href="#_2_1_Dosage_in">Dosage and Administration

ngÂ·hr/mL (SD, 19.4), respectively. The elimination half-life was 2.6 hours (SD,

were seen in any of the treatment groups; the incidence of adverse events was 
similar across groups. These results are consistent with the negligible renal

are also involved to a minor degree.</p>
<p><span>Effects of Other Drugs on ROZEREM 
Metabolism</span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Fluvoxamine (strong CYP1A2 inhibitor): </span>When 
fluvoxamine 100 mg twice daily was administered for 3Â days prior to single-dose 
co-administration of ROZEREM 16Â mg and fluvoxamine, the AUC<span class="Sub">0-inf</span> for ramelteon increased approximately 190-fold, and the 
C<span class="Sub">max</span> increased approximately 70-fold, compared to ROZEREM 
administered alone. ROZEREM should not be used in combination with fluvoxamine. 
Other less strong CYP1A2 inhibitors have not been adequately studied. ROZEREM 
should be administered with caution to patients taking less strong CYP1A2 
inhibitorsÂ [see <span class="Italics"><a href="#_4_CONTRAINDICATIONS">Contraindications</a></span>].</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Rifampin (strong CYP enzyme inducer):</span> 
Administration of rifampin 600 mg once daily for 11 days resulted in a mean 
decrease of approximately 80% (40% to 90%) in total exposure to ramelteon and 
metabolite M-II, (both AUC<span class="Sub">0</span><span class="Sub">-inf</span> 
and C<span class="Sub">max</span>) after a single 32 mg dose of ROZEREM. Efficacy 
may be reduced when ROZEREM is used in combination with strong CYP enzyme 
inducers such as rifampin.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor):</span> The 
AUC<span class="Sub">0-inf</span> and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of ramelteon 
increased by approximately 84% and 36%, respectively, when a single 16Â mg dose 
of ROZEREM was administered on the fourth day of ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily 
administration, compared to administration of ROZEREM alone. Similar increases 
were seen in M-II pharmacokinetic variables. ROZEREM should be administered with 
caution in subjects taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Fluconazole (strong CYP2C9 inhibitor): </span>The total 
and peak systemic exposure (AUC<span class="Sub">0-inf</span> and C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of ramelteon after a single 16Â mg dose of ROZEREM was 
increased by approximately 150% when administered with fluconazole. Similar 
increases were also seen in M-II exposure. ROZEREM should be administered with 
caution in subjects taking strong CYP2C9 inhibitors such as fluconazole.</p>
<p>Interaction studies of concomitant administration of ROZEREM with fluoxetine 
(CYP2D6 inhibitor), omeprazole (CYP1A2 inducer/CYP2C19 inhibitor), theophylline 
(CYP1A2 substrate), and dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate) did not produce 
clinically meaningful changes in either peak or total exposures to ramelteon or 
the M-II metabolite.</p>
<p><span>Effects of ROZEREM on Metabolism of Other 
Drugs</span></p>
<p>Concomitant administration of ROZEREM with omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate), 
dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate), midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate), theophylline 
(CYP1A2 substrate), digoxin (p-glycoprotein substrate) and warfarin (CYP2C9 
[S]/CYP1A2 [R] substrate) did not produce clinically meaningful changes in peak 
and total exposures to these drugs.</p>
<p><span>Effect of Alcohol on ROZEREM</span></p>
<p>With single-dose, daytime co-administration of ROZEREM 32 mg and alcohol (0.6 
g/kg), there were no clinically meaningful or statistically significant effects 
on peak or total exposure to ROZEREM. However, an additive effect was seen on 
some measures of psychomotor performance (i.e., the Digit Symbol Substitution 
Test, the Psychomotor Vigilance Task Test, and a Visual Analog Scale of 
Sedation) at some post-dose time points. No additive effect was seen on the 
Delayed Word Recognition Test. Because alcohol by itself impairs performance, 
and the intended effect of ROZEREM is to promote sleep, patients should be 
cautioned not to consume alcohol when using ROZEREM.</p>

<h1>14  CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<a href="http://"></a><span class="Bold">14.1</span> Â Â Â Â Â  <span class="Bold">Controlled Clinical Trials</span><p class="First"><span><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">Chronic Insomnia</span></span></p>
<p>Three randomized, double-blind trials in subjects with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">chronic insomnia</span> 
employing polysomnography (PSG) were provided as objective support of Rozeremâ€™s 
effectiveness in sleep initiation.</p>
<p>One study enrolled younger adults (aged 18 to 64 years, inclusive) with 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">chronic insomnia</span> and employed a parallel design in which the subjects received a 
single, nightly dose of ROZEREM (8Â mg or 16 mg) or matching placebo for 35 days. 
PSG was performed on the first two nights in each of Weeks 1, 3, and 5 of 
treatment. ROZEREM reduced the average latency to persistent sleep at each of 
the time points when compared to placebo. The 16Â mg dose conferred no additional 
benefit for sleep initiation.</p>
<p>The second study employing PSG was a three-period crossover trial performed 
in subjects aged 65 years and older with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">chronic insomnia</span>. Subjects 
received ROZEREM (4Â mg or 8 mg) or placebo and underwent PSG assessment in a 
sleep laboratory for two consecutive nights in each of the three study periods. 
Both doses of ROZEREM reduced latency to persistent sleep when compared to 
placebo. </p>
<p>The third study evaluated long term efficacy and safety in adults with 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">chronic insomnia</span>. Subjects received a single, nightly dose of ROZEREM 8Â mg or 
matching placebo for 6 months. PSG was performed on the first two nights of 
WeekÂ 1 and Months 1, 3, 5, and 6. ROZEREM reduced sleep latency at each time 
point when compared to placebo. In this study, when the PSG results from nights 
1 and 2 of Month 7 were compared to the results from nights 22 and 23 of Month 
6, there was a statistically significant increase in LPS of 33% (9.5 minutes) in 
the ramelteon group. There was no increase in LPS in the placebo group when the 
same time periods were compared.</p>
<p>A randomized, double-blind, parallel group study was conducted in outpatients 
aged 65 years and older with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">chronic insomnia</span> and employed subjective measures 
of efficacy (sleep diaries). Subjects received ROZEREM (4Â mg or 8Â mg) or placebo 
for 35 nights. ROZEREM reduced patient-reported sleep latency compared to 
placebo. A similarly designed study performed in younger adults (aged 18-64 
years) using 8Â mg and 16 mg of ramelteon did not replicate this finding of 
reduced patient-reported sleep latency compared to placebo.</p>
<p>While the 16 mg dose was evaluated as a potential treatment for adults, it 
was shown to confer no additional benefit for sleep initiation and was 
associated with higher incidences of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> and next-day 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>.</p>
<p><span><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">Transient Insomnia</span></span></p>
<p>In a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial using a 
first-night-effect model, healthy adults received placebo or ROZEREM before 
spending one night in a sleep laboratory and being evaluated with PSG. ROZEREM 
demonstrated a decrease in mean latency to persistent sleep as compared to 
placebo.</p>

Â Â Â Â Â  <span class="Bold">Studies Pertinent to Safety Concerns for Sleep-promoting 
Drugs</span><p><span>Results from Human Laboratory Abuse 
Liability Studies</span></p>
<p>A human laboratory abuse potential study was performed in 14 subjects with a 
history of sedative/hypnotic or anxiolytic drug abuse. Subjects received single 
oral doses of ROZEREM (16, 80, or 160 mg), triazolam (0.25, 0.50, or 0.75 mg) or 
placebo. All subjects received each of the 7 treatments separated by a wash-out 
period and underwent multiple standard tests of abuse potential. No differences 
in subjective responses indicative of abuse potential were found between ROZEREM 
and placebo at doses up to 20 times the recommended therapeutic dose. The 
positive control drug, triazolam, consistently showed a dose-response effect on 
these subjective measures, as demonstrated by the differences from placebo in 
peak effect and overall 24-hour effect. </p>
<p><span>Residual Pharmacological Effect in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">Insomnia</span> 
Trials</span></p>
<p>In order to evaluate potential next-day residual effects, the following 
scales were used: a Memory Recall Test, a Word List Memory Test, a Visual Analog 
Mood and Feeling Scale, the Digit-Symbol Substitution Test, and a post-sleep 
questionnaire to assess alertness and ability to concentrate. There was no 
evidence of next-day residual effect seen after 2 nights of ramelteon use during 
the crossover studies.</p>
<p>In a 35-night, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in 
adults with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">chronic insomnia</span>, measures of residual effects were performed at 
three time points. Overall, the magnitudes of any observed differences were 
small. At WeekÂ 1, patients who received 8Â mg of ROZEREM had a mean VAS score 
(46Â mm on a 100 mm scale) indicating more <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span> in comparison to patients who 
received placebo (42Â mm). At WeekÂ 3, patients who received 8Â mg of ROZEREM had a 
lower mean score for immediate recall (7.5 out of 16 words) compared to patients 
who received placebo (8.2 words); and the patients treated with ROZEREM had a 
mean VAS score indicating more <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4161417" conceptname="Bradykinesia">sluggishness</span> (27Â mm on a 100 mm VAS) in 
comparison to the placebo-treated patients (22Â mm). Patients who received 
ROZEREM did not have next-morning residual effects that were different from 
placebo at WeekÂ 5.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Rebound <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">Insomnia</span>/Withdrawal</span></p>
<p>Potential rebound <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> and withdrawal effects were assessed in four 
studies in which subjects received ROZEREM or placebo for up to 6 months; 3 were 
35-day studies, one was a 6 month study. These studies included a total of 2533 
subjects, of whom 854 were elderly.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Tyrer Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Symptom Questionnaire 
(BWSQ):</span> The BWSQ is a self-report questionnaire that solicits specific 
information on 20 symptoms commonly experienced during withdrawal from 
benzodiazepine receptor agonists; ROZEREM is not a benzodiazepine receptor 
agonist. </p>
<p>In two of the three 35-day <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> studies, the questionnaire was 
administered one week after completion of treatment; in the third study, the 
questionnaire was administered on Days 1 and 2 after completion.Â In all three of 
the 35-day studies, subjects receiving ROZEREM 4Â mg, 8Â mg, or 16Â mg daily 
reported BWSQ scores similar to those of subjects receiving placebo. </p>
<p>In the 6 month study, there was no evidence of withdrawal from the 8Â mg dose 
as measured by the BWSQ.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Rebound <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">Insomnia</span>:</span>Â Rebound <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> was assessed in 
the 35-day studies by measuring sleep latency after abrupt treatment 
discontinuation. One of these studies employed PSG in younger adult subjects 
receiving ROZEREM 8Â mg or 16 mg; the other two studies employed subjective 
measures of sleep-onset <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> in elderly subjects receiving ROZEREM 4Â mg or 8 
mg, and in younger adult subjects receiving ROZEREM 8Â mg or 16 mg. There was no 
evidence that ROZEREM caused rebound <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> during the post-treatment 
period.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Bold">14.3</span> Â Â Â Â Â  <span class="Bold">Studies to Evaluate Effects on Endocrine Function</span><p>Two controlled studies evaluated the effects of ROZEREM on 
endocrine function.</p>
<p>In the first trial, ROZEREM 16 mg once daily or placebo was administered to 
99 healthy volunteer subjects for 4 weeks. This study evaluated the thyroid 
axis, adrenal axis and reproductive axis. No clinically significant 
endocrinopathies were demonstrated in this study. However, the study was limited 
in its ability to detect such abnormalities due to its limited duration.</p>
<p>In the second trial, ROZEREM 16 mg once daily or placebo was administered to 
122 subjects with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">chronic insomnia</span> for 6 months. This study evaluated the 
thyroid axis, adrenal axis and reproductive axis. There were no significant 
abnormalities seen in either the thyroid or the adrenal axes. Abnormalities 
were, however, noted within the reproductive axis. Overall, the mean serum 
prolactin level change from baseline was 4.9Â Î¼g/L (34% increase) for women in 
the ROZEREM group compared with âˆ’0.6Â Î¼g/L (4% decrease) for women in the placebo 
group (p=0.003). No differences between active- and placebo-treated groups 
occurred among men. Thirty-two percent of all patients who were treated with 
ramelteon in this study (women and men) had prolactin levels that increased from 
normal baseline levels compared to 19% of patients who were treated with 
placebo. Subject-reported menstrual patterns were similar between the two 
treatment groups.</p>
<p>In a 12-month, open-label study in adult and elderly patients, there were two 
patients who were noted to have abnormal morning cortisol levels, and subsequent 
abnormal ACTH stimulation tests. A 29-year-old female patient was diagnosed with 
a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4144527" conceptname="Prolactinoma">prolactinoma</span>. The relationship of these events to ROZEREM therapy is not
