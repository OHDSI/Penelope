<h1><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION</span></h1>
<p class="First">Clonidine hydrochloride injection is a centrally-acting analgesic solution for use in continuous epidural infusion devices.</p>
<p>Clonidine hydrochloride is an imidazoline derivative and exists as a mesomeric compound. The chemical names are Benzenamine,2,6-dichloro-N-2-imidazolidinylidene monohydrochloride and 2-[(2,6-dichlorophenyl) imino]imidazolidine monohydrochloride. The following is the structural formula:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="Image from Drug Label Content" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=f6798f73-b5a6-434b-a627-aa102b123dd5&amp;name=clonidine-hcl-injection-1.jpg"></div>
<p>Clonidine hydrochloride injection is supplied as a clear, colorless, preservative-free, pyrogen-free, aqueous sterile solution (pH 5 to 7) in single-dose, 10 mL vials.</p>
<p>Each mL of the 100 mcg/mL (0.1 mg/mL) concentration contains clonidine hydrochloride 100 mcg and sodium chloride 9 mg in water for injection. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment. Each 10 mL vial contains clonidine hydrochloride 1 mg (1000 mcg).</p>
<p>Each mL of the 500 mcg/mL (0.5 mg/mL) concentration contains clonidine hydrochloride 500 mcg and sodium chloride 9 mg in water for injection. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment. Each 10 mL vial contains clonidine hydrochloride 5 mg (5000 mcg).</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></h2>
<p class="First">Epidurally administered clonidine produces dose-dependent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> not antagonized by opiate antagonists.  The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> is limited to the body regions innervated by the spinal segments where analgesic concentrations of clonidine are present.  Clonidine is thought to produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> at presynaptic and postjunctional alpha-2-adrenoceptors in the spinal cord by preventing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> signal transmission to the brain.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span></h2>
<p class="First">Following a 10 minute intravenous infusion of 300 mcg clonidine HCl to five male volunteers, plasma clonidine levels showed an initial rapid distribution phase (mean Â± SD t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>=11 Â± 9 minutes) followed by a slower elimination phase (t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>=9 Â± 2 hours) over 24 hours. Clonidine's total body clearance (CL) was 219 Â± 92 mL/min.</p>
<p>Following a 700 mcg clonidine HCl epidural dose given over five minutes to four male and five female volunteers, peak clonidine plasma levels (4.4 Â± 1.4 ng/mL) were obtained in 19 Â± 27 minutes. The plasma elimination half-life was determined to be 22 Â± 15 hours following sample collection for 24 hours. CL was 190 Â± 70 mL/min. In cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), peak clonidine levels (418 Â± 255 ng/mL) were achieved in 26 Â± 11 minutes. The clonidine CSF elimination half-life was 1.3 Â± 0.5 hours when samples were collected for 6 hours. Compared to men, women had a lower mean plasma clearance, longer mean plasma half-life, and higher mean peak level of clonidine in both plasma and CSF.</p>
<p>In cancer patients who received 14 days of clonidine HCl epidural infusion (rate=30 mcg/hr) plus morphine by patient-controlled <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> (PCA), steady state clonidine plasma concentrations of 2.2 Â± 1.1 and 2.4 Â± 1.4 ng/mL were obtained on dosing days 7 and 14, respectively. CL was 279 Â± 184 and 272 Â± 163 mL/min on these days. CSF concentrations were not determined in these patients.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></h2>
<p class="First">Clonidine is highly lipid soluble and readily distributes into extravascular sites including the central nervous system. Clonidine's volume of distribution is 2.1 Â± 0.4 L/kg. The binding of clonidine to plasma protein is primarily to albumin and varies between 20 and 40%<span class="Italics">in vitro</span>. Epidurally administered clonidine readily partitions into plasma via the epidural veins and attains systemic concentrations (0.5 to 2.0 ng/mL) that are associated with a hypotensive effect mediated by the central nervous system.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Excretion</span></h2>
<p class="First">Following an intravenous dose of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-clonidine, 72% of the administered dose was excreted in urine in 96 hours of which 40 to 50% was unchanged clonidine. Renal clearance for clonidine was determined to be 133 Â± 66 mL/min. In a study where <span class="Sup">14</span>C-clonidine was given to subjects with varying degrees of kidney function, elimination half-lives varied (17.5 to 41 hours) as a function of creatinine clearance. In subjects undergoing hemodialysis only 5% of body clonidine stores was removed.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></h2>
<p class="First">In humans, clonidine metabolism follows minor pathways with the major metabolite, p-hydroxy-clonidine, being present at less than 10% of the concentration of unchanged drug in urine.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Clinical Trials</span></h2>
<p class="First">In a double-blind, randomized study of cancer patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">intractable pain</span> below the C4 dermatome not controlled by morphine, 38 patients were randomized to an epidural infusion of clonidine hydrochloride plus epidural morphine, whereas 47 subjects received epidural placebo plus epidural morphine. Both groups were allowed rescue doses of epidural morphine. Successful <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, defined as a decrease in either morphine use or Visual Analog Score (VAS) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, was significantly more common with epidural clonidine than placebo (45% vs 21%, p=0.016). Only the subgroup of 36 patients with â€œneuropathicâ€? <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, characterized by the investigator as well-localized, burning, shooting, or electric-like <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> in a dermatomal or peripheral nerve distribution had significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effects</span> relative to placebo in this study.</p>
<p>The most frequent adverse events with clonidine were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> (45% vs 11% for placebo, p&lt; 0.001), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span> (32% vs 0%, p&lt; 0.001), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span> (13% vs 4%, p=0.234), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> (11% vs 2%, p=0.168) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226991" conceptname="Aptyalism">dry mouth</span> (13% vs 9%, p=0.505). Both mean blood pressure and heart rate were reduced in the clonidine group. At the conclusion of the two week study period in the clinical trial, all patients were abruptly withdrawn from study drug or placebo. Four patients of the clonidine group suffered <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221991" conceptname="Rebound hypertension">rebound hypertension</span> upon withdrawal of clonidine; one of these patients suffered a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">cerebrovascular accident</span>.

<h1><span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</span></h1>
<p class="First">Clonidine hydrochloride is indicated in combination with opiates for the treatment of severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> in cancer patients that is not adequately relieved by opioid analgesics alone. Epidural clonidine is more likely to be effective in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373852" conceptname="Neuralgia">neuropathic pain</span> than somatic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4251315" conceptname="Visceral pain">visceral pain</span> (see<a href="#LINK_55bfb1b4-5865-4ff2-b69c-b7186661684f">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Trials</a>).</p>
<p>The safety of this drug product has only been established in a highly selected group of cancer patients, and only after an adequate trial of opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>. Other use is of unproven safety and is not recommended. In a rare patient, the potential benefits may outweigh the known risks (see<a href="#LINK_5c38af9e-dfce-46f9-841e-92abdbb7852f">WARNINGS</a>).</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span></h1>
<p class="First">Clonidine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with a history of sensitization or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergic reactions</span> to clonidine. Epidural administration is contraindicated in the presence of an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4318388" conceptname="Injection site infection">injection site infection</span>, in patients on anticoagulant therapy, and in those with a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> diathesis. Administration of clonidine hydrochloride above the C4 dermatome is contraindicated since there are no adequate safety data to support such use.

<h2><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span></span></h2>
<p class="First">Because severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> may follow the administration of clonidine, it should be used with caution in all patients. It is not recommended in most patients with severe cardiovascular disease or in those who are otherwise hemodynamically unstable. The benefit of its administration in these patients should be carefully balanced against the potential risks resulting from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>.</p>
<p>Vital signs should be monitored frequently, especially during the first few days of epidural clonidine therapy. When clonidine is infused into the upper thoracic spinal segments, more pronounced decreases in the blood pressure may be seen.</p>
<p>Clonidine decreases sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system resulting in decreases in peripheral resistance, renal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span>, heart rate, and blood pressure. However, in the absence of profound <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate remain essentially unchanged.</p>
<p>In the pivotal double-blind, randomized study of cancer patients, where 38 subjects were administered epidural clonidine hydrochloride at 30 mcg/hr in addition to epidural morphine, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> occurred in 45% of subjects. Most episodes of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> occurred within the first four days after beginning epidural clonidine. However, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotensive episodes</span> occurred throughout the duration of the trial. There was a tendency for these episodes to occur more commonly in women, and in those with higher serum clonidine levels. Patients experiencing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> also tended to weigh less than those who did not experience <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>. The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> is usually responsive to intravenous fluids and, if necessary, appropriate parenterally-administered pressor agents.</p>
<p>Published reports on the use of epidural clonidine for intraoperative or postoperative <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> also show a consistent and marked hypotensive response to clonidine. Severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> may occur even if intravenous fluid pretreatment is given.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Withdrawal</span></h2>
<p class="First">Sudden cessation of clonidine treatment, regardless of the route of administration, has, in some cases, resulted in symptoms such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436817" conceptname="Feeling nervous">nervousness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span>, accompanied or followed by a rapid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="141693" conceptname="Elevated blood-pressure reading without diagnosis of hypertension">rise in blood pressure</span>. The likelihood of such reactions appears to be greater after administration of higher doses or with concomitant beta-blocker treatment. Special caution is therefore advised in these situations. Rare instances of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312938" conceptname="Hypertensive encephalopathy">hypertensive encephalopathy</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">cerebrovascular accidents</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> have been reported after abrupt clonidine withdrawal. Patients with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> and/or other underlying cardiovascular conditions may be at particular risk of the consequences of abrupt discontinuation of clonidine. In the pivotal double-blind, randomized cancer <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> study, four of 38 subjects receiving 720 mcg of clonidine per day experienced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221991" conceptname="Rebound hypertension">rebound hypertension</span> following abrupt withdrawal. One of these patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221991" conceptname="Rebound hypertension">rebound hypertension</span> subsequently experienced a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">cerebrovascular accident</span>.</p>
<p>Careful monitoring of infusion pump function and inspection of catheter tubing for obstruction or dislodgement can help reduce the risk of inadvertent abrupt withdrawal of epidural clonidine. Patients should notify their physician immediately if clonidine administration is inadvertently interrupted for any reason. Patients should also be instructed not to discontinue therapy without consulting their physician.</p>
<p>When discontinuing therapy with epidural clonidine, the physician should reduce the dose gradually over 2 to 4 days to avoid withdrawal symptoms.</p>
<p>An excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="141693" conceptname="Elevated blood-pressure reading without diagnosis of hypertension">rise in blood pressure</span> following discontinuation of epidural clonidine can be treated by administration of clonidine or by intravenous phentolamine. If therapy is to be discontinued in patients receiving a beta-blocker and clonidine concurrently, the beta-blocker should be withdrawn several days before the gradual discontinuation of epidural clonidine.</p>

<p class="First">Patients should be instructed about the risks of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221991" conceptname="Rebound hypertension">rebound hypertension</span> and warned not to discontinue clonidine except under the supervision of a physician. Patients should notify their physician immediately if clonidine administration is inadvertently interrupted for any reason. Patients who engage in potentially hazardous activities, such as operating machinery or driving, should be advised of the potential sedative and hypotensive effects of epidural clonidine. They should also be informed that sedative effects may be increased by CNS-depressing drugs such as alcohol and barbiturates, and that hypotensive effects may be increased by opiates.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></h2>
<p class="First">Clonidine may potentiate the CNS-depressive effect of alcohol, barbiturates or other sedating drugs. Narcotic analgesics may potentiate the hypotensive effects of clonidine. Tricyclic antidepressants may antagonize the hypotensive effects of clonidine. The effects of tricyclic antidepressants on clonidine's analgesic actions are not known.</p>
<p>Beta-blockers may exacerbate the hypertensive response seen with clonidine withdrawal. Also, due to the potential for additive effects such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316135" conceptname="Atrioventricular block">AV block</span>, caution is warranted in patients receiving clonidine with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction, e.g., digitalis, calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockers.</p>
<p>There is one reported case of a patient with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373995" conceptname="Delirium">acute delirium</span> associated with the simultaneous use of fluphenazine and oral clonidine.

<h2><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</span></h2>
<p class="First">In a 132-week study in rats, clonidine hydrochloride administered as a dietary admixture at 5 to 8 times (based on body surface area) the 50 mcg/kg maximum recommended daily human dose (MRDHD) for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> did not show any carcinogenic potential. Clonidine was inactive in the Ames test of mutagenicity. Fertility of male or female rats was unaffected by oral clonidine hydrochloride doses as high as 150 mcg/kg, or about 0.5 times the MRDHD. Fertility of female rats did, however, appear to be affected in another experiment at oral dose levels of 500 to 2000 mcg/kg, or 2 to 7 times the MRDHD.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold">Teratogenic Effects</span></h3>
<p class="First">PREGNANCY CATEGORY C: Reproduction studies in rabbits at clonidine hydrochloride doses up to approximately the MRDHD revealed no evidence of teratogenic or embryotoxic potential. In rats, however, doses as low as one-third the MRDHD were associated with increased resorptions in a study in which dams were treated continuously from 2 months prior to mating. Increased resorptions were not associated with treatment with the same or higher doses up to 0.5 times the MRDHD when dams were treated on days 6 to 15 of gestation. Increased resorptions were observed at higher levels (7-times the MRDHD) in rats and mice treated on days 1 to 14 of gestation.</p>
<p>Clonidine readily crosses the placenta and its concentrations are equal in maternal and umbilical cord plasma; amniotic fluid concentrations can be 4-times those found in serum. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women during early gestation when organ formation takes place. Studies using epidural clonidine during labor have demonstrated no apparent adverse effects on the infant at the time of delivery. However, these studies did not monitor the infants for hemodynamic effects in the days following delivery. Clonidine hydrochloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits justify the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Labor and Delivery</span></h2>
<p class="First">There are no adequate controlled clinical trials evaluating the safety, efficacy, and dosing of clonidine hydrochloride in obstetrical settings. Because maternal perfusion of the placenta is critically dependent on blood pressure, use of clonidine hydrochloride as an analgesic during labor and delivery is not indicated (see <a href="#LINK_5c38af9e-dfce-46f9-841e-92abdbb7852f">WARNINGS</a>).</p>

<p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of clonidine hydrochloride in this limited indication and clinical population have been established in patients old enough to tolerate placement and management of an epidural catheter, based on evidence from adequate and well controlled studies in adults and experience with the use of clonidine in the pediatric age group for other indications. The use of clonidine hydrochloride should be restricted to pediatric patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">intractable pain</span> from malignancy that is unresponsive to epidural or spinal opiates or other more conventional analgesic techniques.

<h1><span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span></h1>
<p class="First">Adverse reactions seen during continuous epidural clonidine infusion are dose-dependent and typical for a compound of this pharmacologic class. The adverse events most frequently reported in the pivotal controlled clinical trial of continuous epidural clonidine administration consisted of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span>, decreased heart rate, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221991" conceptname="Rebound hypertension">rebound hypertension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226991" conceptname="Aptyalism">dry mouth</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> is the adverse event that most frequently requires treatment. The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> is usually responsive to intravenous fluids and, if necessary, appropriate parenterally-administered pressor agents. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> was observed more frequently in women and in lower weight patients, but no dose-related response was established.</p>
<p>Implantable epidural catheters are associated with a risk of catheter-related <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span>, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435785" conceptname="Meningitis">meningitis</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4268039" conceptname="Epidural abscess">epidural abscess</span>. The risk depends on the clinical situation and the type of catheter used, but catheter related <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> occur in 5% to 20% of patients, depending on the kind of catheter used, catheter placement technique, quality of catheter care, and length of catheter placement.</p>
<p>The inadvertent intrathecal administration of clonidine has not been associated with a significantly increased risk of adverse events, but there are inadequate safety and efficacy data to support the use of intrathecal clonidine.</p>
<p>Epidural clonidine was compared to placebo in a two week double-blind study of 85 terminal cancer patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">intractable pain</span> receiving epidural morphine. The following adverse events were reported in two or more patients and may be related to administration of either clonidine hydrochloride or morphine.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span></h1>
<p class="First">The recommended starting dose of clonidine hydrochloride for continuous epidural infusion is 30 mcg/hr. Although dosage may be titrated up or down depending on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relief and occurrence of adverse events, experience with dosage rates above 40 mcg/hr is limited.</p>
<p>Familiarization with the continuous epidural infusion device is essential. Patients receiving epidural clonidine from a continuous infusion device should be closely monitored for the first few days to assess their response.</p>
<p>The 500 mcg/mL (0.5 mg/mL) strength product must be diluted prior to use in 0.9% Sodium Chloride for Injection, U.S.P., to a final concentration of 100 mcg/mL:</p>
