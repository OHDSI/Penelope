<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Ofloxacin Otic Solution 0.3% is a sterile aqueous anti-infective (anti-bacterial) solution for otic use. Chemically, ofloxacin has three condensed 6-membered rings made up of a fluorinated carboxyquinolone with a benzoxazine ring. The chemical name of ofloxacin is (Â±)-9-fluoro-2,3-dihydro-3-methyl-10-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-7-oxo-7<span class="Italics">H</span>-pyrido [1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazine-6- carboxylic acid. The empirical formula of ofloxacin is C<span class="Sub">18</span>H<span class="Sub">20</span>FN<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">4</span> and its molecular weight is 361.38. The structural formula is:</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Drug concentrations in serum (in subjects with tympanostomy tubes and perforated tympanic membranes), in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378160" conceptname="Otorrhea">otorrhea</span>, and in mucosa of the middle ear (in subjects with perforated tympanic membranes) were determined following otic administration of ofloxacin solution. In two single-dose studies, mean ofloxacin serum concentrations were low in adult patients with tympanostomy tubes, with and without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378160" conceptname="Otorrhea">otorrhea</span>, after otic administration of a 0.3% solution (4.1 ng/mL (n=3) and 5.4 ng/mL (n=5), respectively). In adults with perforated tympanic membranes, the maximum serum drug level of ofloxacin detected was 10 ng/mL after administration of a 0.3% solution. Ofloxacin was detectable in the middle ear mucosa of some adult subjects with perforated tympanic membranes (11 of 16 subjects). The variability of ofloxacin concentration in middle ear mucosa was high. The concentrations ranged from 1.2 to 602 Âµg/g after otic administration of a 0.3% solution. Ofloxacin was present in high concentrations in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378160" conceptname="Otorrhea">otorrhea</span> (389 - 2850 Âµg/g, n=13) 30 minutes after otic administration of a 0.3% solution in subjects with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260730" conceptname="Chronic atticoantral suppurative otitis media">chronic suppurative otitis media</span> and perforated tympanic membranes. However, the measurement of ofloxacin in the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378160" conceptname="Otorrhea">otorrhea</span> does not necessarily reflect the exposure of the middle ear to ofloxacin.</p>

<h2>Microbiology</h2>
<p class="First">Ofloxacin has <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms. Ofloxacin exerts its antibacterial activity by inhibiting DNA gyrase, a bacterial topoisomerase. DNA gyrase is an essential enzyme which controls DNA topolgy and assists in DNA replication, repair, deactivation, and transcription. Cross-resistance has been observed between ofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones. There is generally no cross-resistance between ofloxacin and other classes of antibacterial agents such as beta-lactams or aminoglycosides.</p>
<p>Ofloxacin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and clinically in otic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section.</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">As with other anti-infective preparations, prolonged use may result in over-growth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> is not improved after one week, cultures should be obtained to guide further treatment. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378160" conceptname="Otorrhea">otorrhea</span> persists after a full course of therapy, or if two or more episodes of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378160" conceptname="Otorrhea">otorrhea</span> occur within six months, further evaluation is recommended to exclude an underlying condition such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372925" conceptname="Cholesteatoma">cholesteatoma</span>, foreign body, or a tumor.</p>
<p>The systemic administration of quinolones, including ofloxacin at doses much higher than given or absorbed by the otic route, has led to lesions or erosions of the cartilage in weight-bearing joints and other signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="73553" conceptname="Arthropathy">arthropathy</span> in immature animals of various species.</p>
<p>Young growing guinea pigs dosed in the middle ear with 0.3% ofloxacin otic solution showed no systemic effects, lesions or erosions of the cartilage in weight-bearing joints, or other signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="73553" conceptname="Arthropathy">arthropathy</span>. No drug-related structural or functional changes of the cochlea and no lesions in the ossicles were noted in the guinea pig following otic administration of 0.3% ofloxacin for one month.</p>
<p>No signs of local irritation were found when 0.3% ofloxacin was applied topically in the rabbit eye. Ofloxacin was also shown to lack dermal sensitizing potential in the guinea pig maximization study.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Long-term studies to determine the carcinogenic potential of ofloxacin have not been conducted. Ofloxacin was not mutagenic in the Ames test, the sister chromatid exchange assay (Chinese hamster and human cell lines), the unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay using human fibroblasts, the dominant lethal assay, or the mouse micronucleus assay. Ofloxacin was positive in the rat hepatocyte UDS assay, and in the mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> assay. In rats, ofloxacin did not affect male or female reproductive performance at oral doses up to 360 mg/kg/day. This would be over 1000 times the maximum recommended clinical dose, based upon body surface area, assuming total absorption of ofloxacin from the ear of a patient treated with Ofloxacin Otic Solution twice per day.</p>

<h3>Teratogenic effects</h3>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category C. </span>Ofloxacin has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rats at a dose of 810 mg/kg/day and in rabbits at 160 mg/kg/day.</p>
<p>These dosages resulted in decreased fetal body weights and increased fetal mortality in rats and rabbits, respectively. Minor fetal skeletal variations were reported in rats receiving doses of 810 mg/kg/day. Ofloxacin has not been shown to be teratogenic at doses as high as 810 mg/kg/day and 160 mg/kg/day when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits, respectively.</p>
<p>Ofloxacin has not been shown to have any adverse effects on the developing embryo or fetus at doses relevant to the amount of ofloxacin that will be delivered ototopically at the recommended clinical doses.</p>

<h3>Nonteratogenic effects</h3>
<p class="First">Additional studies in the rat demonstrated that doses up to 360 mg/kg/day during late gestation had no adverse effects on late fetal development, labor, delivery, lactation, neonatal viability, or growth of the newborn. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ofloxacin Otic Solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<h2>Nursing mothers</h2>
<p class="First">In nursing women, a single 200 mg oral dose resulted in concentrations of ofloxacin in milk which were similar to those found in plasma. It is not known whether ofloxacin is excreted in human milk following topical otic administration. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from ofloxacin in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<h2>Pediatric use</h2>
<p class="First">Safety and efficacy have been demonstrated in pediatric patients of the following ages for the listed indications:</p>
<ul>
<li>six months and older: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380731" conceptname="Otitis externa">otitis externa</span> with intact tympanic membranes</li>

<p>Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients below these ages have not been established.</p>
<p>Although no data are available on patients less than 6 months, there are no known safety concerns or differences in the disease process in this population that will preclude use of this product.</p>
<p>No changes in hearing function ocurred in 30 pediatric subjects treated with ofloxacin otic and tested for audiometric parameters.</p>
<p>Although quinolones, including ofloxacin, have been shown to cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="73553" conceptname="Arthropathy">arthropathy</span> in immature animals after systemic administration, young growing guinea pigs dosed in the middle ear with 0.3% ofloxacin otic solution for one month showed no systemic effects, quinolone-induced lesions, erosions of the cartilage in weight-bearing joints, or other signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="73553" conceptname="Arthropathy">arthropathy</span>.</p>

<p>In patients with a Middle <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4044878" conceptname="Infection of ear">Ear Infection</span>, Ofloxacin Otic Solution ear drops should be given 2 times each day (about 12 hours apart, for example 8 AM and 8 PM) in each infected ear unless the doctor has instructed otherwise.
