<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>Enalapril maleate is the maleate salt of enalapril, the ethyl ester of a long-acting angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalaprilat. Enalapril maleate is chemically described as L-Proline,1-[N-[1-(ethoxycarbonyl)-3-phenylpropyl]-L-alanyl]- , (S)-, (Z)-2-butenedioate (1:1). Its molecular formula is, C<span class="Sub">20</span>H<span class="Sub">28</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">5</span>·C<span class="Sub">4</span>H<span class="Sub">4</span>O<span class="Sub">4</span>, and its structural formula is:<div class="Figure"><img alt="Enalapril Structure Label" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=5cc4f6f0-8925-81e1-b210-b5a4509a25a9&amp;name=Enalapril%20%20Tablets_Structure.jpg"></div>Enalapril maleate is a white to off-white, crystalline powder with a molecular weight of 492.53. It is sparingly soluble in water, soluble in ethanol, and freely soluble in methanol.<br>Enalapril is a pro-drug; following oral administration, it is bioactivated by hydrolysis of the ethyl ester to enalaprilat, which is the active angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor.<br>Enalapril maleate is supplied as 2.5 mg, 5 mg,10 mg and 20 mg tablets for oral administration. In addition, each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: hypromellose, anhydrous lactose, corn starch, stearic acid and talc. The 10 mg and 20 mg tablets also contain iron oxides.</div>

<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>Enalapril, after hydrolysis to enalaprilat, inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. The beneficial effects of enalapril in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> appear to result primarily from suppression of the renin -angiotensin-aldosterone system. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. Although the latter decrease is small, it results in small increases of serum potassium. In hypertensive patients treated with enalapril alone for up to 48 weeks, mean increases in serum potassium of approximately 0.2 mEq/L were observed. In patients treated with enalapril plus a thiazide diuretic, there was essentially no change in serum potassium. (See PRECAUTIONS.) Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity.<br>ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of enalapril remains to be elucidated. <br><br>While the mechanism through which enalapril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system, enalapril is antihypertensive even in patients with low-renin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>. Although enalapril was antihypertensive in all races studied, black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to enalapril monotherapy than non-black patients.</div>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</h2>Following oral administration of enalapril maleate, peak serum concentrations of enalapril occur within about one hour. Based on urinary recovery, the extent of absorption of enalapril is approximately 60 percent. Enalapril absorption is not influenced by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract. Following absorption, enalapril is hydrolyzed to enalaprilat, which is a more potent angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor than enalapril; enalaprilat is poorly absorbed when administered orally. Peak serum concentrations of enalaprilat occur three to four hours after an oral dose of enalapril maleate. Excretion of enalapril is primarily renal. Approximately 94 percent of the dose is recovered in the urine and feces as enalaprilat or enalapril. The principal components in urine are enalaprilat, accounting for about 40 percent of the dose, and intact enalapril. There is no evidence of metabolites of enalapril, other than  enalaprilat.<br><br>The serum concentration profile of enalaprilat exhibits a prolonged terminal phase, apparently representing a small fraction of the administered dose that has been bound to ACE. The amount bound does not increase with dose, indicating a saturable site of binding. The effective half-life for accumulation of enalaprilat following multiple doses of enalapril maleate is 11 hours.<br><br>The disposition of enalapril and enalaprilat in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> is similar to that in patients with normal renal function until the glomerular filtration rate is 30 mL/min or less. With glomerular filtration rate ≤30 mL/min, peak and trough enalaprilat levels increase, time to peak concentration increases and time to steady state may be delayed. The effective half-life of enalaprilat following multiple doses of enalapril maleate is prolonged at this level of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) Enalaprilat is dialyzable at the rate of 62 mL/min.<br><br>Studies in dogs indicate that enalapril crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all; enalaprilat does not enter the brain. Multiple doses of enalapril maleate in rats do not result in accumulation in any tissues. Milk of lactating rats contains radioactivity following administration of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-enalapril maleate. Radioactivity was found to cross the placenta following administration of labeled drug to pregnant hamsters.</div>

Symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span> is therefore infrequent, although it might be anticipated in volume-depleted patients. (See WARNINGS.)<br><br>In most patients studied, after oral administration of a single dose of enalapril, onset of antihypertensive activity was seen at one hour with peak reduction of blood pressure achieved by four to six hours.<br><br>At recommended doses, antihypertensive effects have been maintained for at least 24 hours. In some patients the effects may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).<br><br>In some patients achievement of optimal blood pressure reduction may require several weeks of therapy.<br><br>The antihypertensive effects of enalapril have continued during long term therapy.

Diseases that excluded patients from enrollment in the study included severe stable angina (&gt;2 attacks/day), hemodynamically significant valvular or outflow tract obstruction, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> (creatinine &gt;2.5 mg/dL), cerebral vascular disease (e.g., significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4153380" conceptname="Disorder of carotid artery">carotid artery disease</span>), advanced pulmonary disease, malignancies, active <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314383" conceptname="Myocarditis">myocarditis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312334" conceptname="Constrictive pericarditis">constrictive pericarditis</span>.

Compared to placebo, 32 percent fewer patients receiving enalapril developed symptoms of overt <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>. Hospitalizations for cardiovascular reasons were also reduced. There was an insignificant reduction in hospitalizations for any cause in the enalapril treatment group (for enalapril vs. placebo, respectively, 1166 vs. 1201 first hospitalizations, 2649 vs. 2840 total hospitalizations), although the study was not powered to look for such an effect.<br><br>The SOLVD-Prevention trial was not designed to determine whether treatment of asymptomatic patients with low <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4108582" conceptname="Left ventricular ejection fraction">ejection fraction</span> would be superior, with respect to preventing hospitalization, to closer follow-up and use of enalapril at the earliest sign of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>. However, under the conditions of follow-up in the SOLVD-Prevention trial (every 4 months at the study clinic; personal physician as needed), 68% of patients on placebo who were hospitalized for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> had no prior symptoms recorded which would have signaled initiation of treatment.<br><br>The SOLVD-Prevention trial was also not designed to show whether enalapril modified the progression of underlying heart disease. <br><br>In another multicenter, placebo-controlled trial (CONSENSUS) limited to patients with NYHA Class IV <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span> and radiographic evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314658" conceptname="Cardiomegaly">cardiomegaly</span>, use of enalapril was associated with improved survival.

</table>In both CONSENSUS and SOLVD-Treatment trials, patients were also usually receiving digitalis, diuretics or both. <br><br><span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology in Pediatric Patients</span><br>A multiple dose pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 40 hypertensive male and female pediatric patients aged 2 months to ≤16 years following daily oral administration of 0.07 to 0.14 mg/kg enalapril maleate. At steady state, the mean effective half-life for accumulation of enalaprilat was 14 hours and the mean urinary recovery of total enalapril and enalaprilat in 24 hours was 68% of the administered dose. Conversion of enalapril to enalaprilat was in the range of 63-76%. The overall results of this study indicate that the pharmacokinetics of enalapril in hypertensive children aged 2 months to ≤16 years are consistent across the studied age groups and consistent with pharmacokinetic historic data in healthy adults. <br><br>In a clinical study involving 110 hypertensive pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age, patients who weighed &lt;50 kg received either 0.625, 2.5 or 20 mg of enalapril daily and patients who weighed ≥50 kg received either 1.25, 5, or 40 mg of enalapril daily. Enalapril administration once daily lowered trough blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner. The dose-dependent antihypertensive efficacy of enalapril was consistent across all subgroups (age, Tanner stage, gender, race). However, the lowest doses studied, 0.625 mg and 1.25 mg, corresponding to an average of 0.02 mg/kg once daily, did not appear to offer consistent antihypertensive efficacy. In this study, Enalapril maleate was generally well tolerated.<br><br>In the above pediatric studies, enalapril maleate was given as tablets and for those children and infants who were unable to swallow tablets or who required a lower dose than is available in tablet form, enalapril was administered in a suspension formulation (see <span class="Italics">Preparation of Suspension</span> under DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</div>

Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> given enalapril maleate commonly have some reduction in blood pressure, especially with the first dose, but discontinuation of therapy for continuing symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> usually is not necessary when dosing instructions are followed; caution should be observed when initiating therapy.

A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further doses of enalapril maleate, which usually can be given without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. If symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> develops, a dose reduction or discontinuation of enalapril maleate or concomitant diuretic may be necessary.<br><br>

<h2>Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality</h2>ACE inhibitors can cause fetal and neonatal morbidity and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> when administered to pregnant women. Several dozen cases have been reported in the world literature. When pregnancy is detected, ACE inhibitors should be discontinued as soon as possible.<br>In a published retrospective epidemiological study, infants whose mothers had taken an ACE inhibitor during their first trimester of pregnancy appeared to have an increased risk of major congenital malformations compared with infants whose mothers had not undergone first timester exposure to ACE inhibitor drugs. The number of cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span> is small and the findings of this study are not yet been repeated.<br>The use of ACE inhibitors during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy has been associated with fetal and neonatal injury, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, neonatal skull hypoplasia, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090272" conceptname="Anuria">anuria</span>, reversible or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198185" conceptname="Chronic renal failure">irreversible renal failure</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">Oligohydramnios</span> has also been reported, presumably resulting from decreased fetal renal function; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> in this setting has been associated with fetal limb <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208264" conceptname="Muscle contracture">contractures</span>, craniofacial deformation, and hypoplastic lung development. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439128" conceptname="Extreme immaturity">Prematurity</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80204" conceptname="Fetal growth restriction">intrauterine growth retardation</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315922" conceptname="Patent ductus arteriosus">patent ductus arteriosus</span> have also been reported, although it is not clear whether these occurrences were due to the ACE-inhibitor exposure.<br>These adverse effects do not appear to have resulted from intrauterine ACE-inhibitor exposure that has been limited to the first trimester. Mothers whose embryos and fetuses are exposed to ACE inhibitors only during the first trimester should be so informed. Nonetheless, when patients become pregnant, physicians should make every effort to discontinue the use of enalapril maleate as soon as possible.<br>Rarely (probably less often than once in every thousand pregnancies), no alternative to ACE inhibitors will be found. In these rare cases, the mothers should be apprised of the potential hazards to their fetuses, and serial ultrasound examinations should be performed to assess the intraamniotic environment. <br>If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> is observed, enalapril maleate should be discontinued unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Contraction stress testing (CST), a non-stress test (NST), or biophysical profiling (BPP) may be appropriate, depending upon the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury.<br>Infants with histories of <span class="Italics">in utero</span> exposure to ACE inhibitors should be closely observed for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306451" conceptname="Oliguria">oliguria</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span>. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306451" conceptname="Oliguria">oliguria</span> occurs, attention should be directed towards support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusion or dialysis may be required as means of reversing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> and/or substituting for disordered renal function. Enalapril, which crosses the placenta, has been removed from<br>neonatal circulation by peritoneal dialysis with some clinical benefit, and theoretically may be removed by exchange transfusion, although there is no experience with the latter procedure.<br>No teratogenic effects of enalapril were seen in studies of pregnant rats, and rabbits. On a body surface area basis, the doses used were 57 times and 12 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily dose (MRHDD).</div>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> </span>— <span class="Italics">Patients on Diuretic Therapy:</span> Patients on diuretics and especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with enalapril. The possibility of hypotensive effects with enalapril can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with enalapril. If it is necessary to continue the diuretic, provide close medical supervision after the initial dose for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour. (See WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)<br><span class="Italics">Agents Causing Renin Release:</span> The antihypertensive effect of enalapril maleate is augmented by antihypertensive agents that cause renin release (e.g., diuretics).<br><span class="Italics">Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Agents:</span> In some patients with compromised renal function who are being treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the co-administration of enalapril may result in a further deterioration of renal function. These effects are usually reversible. <br>In a clinical pharmacology study, indomethacin or sulindac was administered to hypertensive patients receiving enalapril maleate. In this study there was no evidence of a blunting of the antihypertensive action of enalapril maleate. However, reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE inhibitors. <br><span class="Italics">Other Cardiovascular Agents: </span>Enalapril maleate has been used concomitantly with beta adrenergic-blocking agents, methyldopa, nitrates, calcium-blocking agents, hydralazine, prazosin and digoxin without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions.<br><span class="Italics">Agents Increasing  Serum Potassium:</span> Enalapril maleate attenuates potassium loss  caused  by  thiazide-type  diuretics.  Potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, triamterene, or amiloride), potassium supplements, or  potassium-containing salt  substitutes  may  lead to  significant  increases  in  serum  potassium. Therefore, if  concomitant  use of these agents is indicated because of demonstrated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>, they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium.  Potassium sparing agents should generally not be used in patients with heart failure receiving enalapril maleate. <br><span class="Italics">Lithium:</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">Lithium toxicity</span> has been reported in patients receiving lithium concomitantly with drugs which cause elimination of sodium, including ACE inhibitors. A few cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium toxicity</span> have been reported in patients receiving concomitant enalapril maleate and lithium and were reversible upon discontinuation of both drugs.

In clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse experiences was required in 3.3 percent of patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> and in 5.7 percent of patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>. The frequency of adverse experiences was not related to total daily dosage within the usual dosage ranges. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> the overall percentage of patients treated with enalapril maleate reporting adverse experiences was comparable to placebo.<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34084-4">

The diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued for two to three days before beginning therapy with Enalapril Maleate Tablets to reduce the likelihood of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>. (See WARNINGS.) If the patient's blood pressure is not controlled with Enalapril Maleate Tablets alone, diuretic therapy may be resumed. <br>If the diuretic cannot be discontinued an initial dose of 2.5 mg should be used under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions</span>.)<br>The recommended initial dose in patients not on diuretics is 5 mg once a day. Dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure response. The usual dosage range is 10 to 40 mg per day administered in a single dose or two divided doses. In some patients treated once daily, the antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval. In such patients, an increase in dosage or twice daily administration should be considered. If blood pressure is not controlled with Enalapril Maleate Tablets alone, a diuretic may be added.<br>Concomitant administration of Enalapril Maleate Tablets with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes, or potassium-sparing diuretics may lead to increases of serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS).<br><br><span class="Italics">Dosage Adjustment in Hypertensive Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal Impairment</span></span><br>The usual dose of enalapril is recommended for patients with a creatinine clearance &gt;30 mL/min (serum creatinine of up to approximately 3 mg/dL).
