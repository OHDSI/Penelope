<h1><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION</span></h1>
<p class="First">The Potassium Chloride Extended Release Tablets USP, 20 mEq product is an immediately dispersing extended release oral dosage form of potassium chloride containing 1500 mg of microencapsulated potassium chloride, USP equivalent to 20 mEq of potassium in a tablet.</p>
<p>These formulations are intended to slow the release of potassium so that the likelihood of a high localized concentration of potassium chloride within the gastrointestinal tract is reduced.</p>
<p>Potassium Chloride Extended Release Tablets USP, 20 mEq is an electrolyte replenisher. The chemical name of the active ingredient is potassium chloride, and the structural formula is KCl. Potassium chloride, USP occurs as a white, granular powder or as colorless crystals. It is odorless and has a saline taste. Its solutions are neutral to litmus. It is freely soluble in water and insoluble in alcohol.</p>
<p>Potassium Chloride Extended Release Tablets USP, 20 mEq is a tablet formulation (not enteric coated or wax matrix) containing individually microencapsulated potassium chloride crystals which disperse upon tablet disintegration. In simulated gastric fluid at 37Â°C and in the absence of outside <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, Potassium Chloride Extended Release Tablets USP, 20 mEq begin disintegrating into microencapsulated crystals within seconds and completely disintegrates within 1 minute. The microencapsulated crystals are formulated to provide an extended release of potassium chloride.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Inactive Ingredients: </span>Colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, diethyl phthalate, ethyl-cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span></h1>
<p class="First">The potassium ion is the principal intracellular cation of most body tissues. Potassium ions participate in a number of essential physiological processes including the maintenance of intracellular tonicity; the transmission of nerve impulses; the contraction of cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle; and the maintenance of normal renal function.</p>
<p>The intracellular concentration of potassium is approximately 150 to 160 mEq per liter. The normal adult plasma concentration is 3.5 to 5 mEq per liter. An active ion transport system maintains this gradient across the plasma membrane.</p>
<p>Potassium is a normal dietary constituent and under steady-state conditions the amount of potassium absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract is equal to the amount excreted in the urine. The usual dietary intake of potassium is 50 to 100 mEq per day.</p>
<p>Potassium depletion will occur whenever the rate of potassium loss through renal excretion and/or loss from the gastrointestinal tract exceeds the rate of potassium intake. Such depletion usually develops as a consequence of therapy with diuretics, primary or secondary hyperaldosteronism, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443727" conceptname="Diabetic ketoacidosis">diabetic ketoacidosis</span>, or inadequate replacement of potassium in patients on prolonged parenteral nutrition. Depletion can develop rapidly with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, especially if associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>. Potassium depletion due to these causes is usually accompanied by a concomitant loss of chloride and is manifested by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030381" conceptname="Metabolic alkalosis">metabolic alkalosis</span>. Potassium depletion may produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">weakness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span>, disturbances or cardiac rhythm (primarily ectopic beats), prominent U-waves in the electrocardiogram, and in advanced cases, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4193951" conceptname="Flaccid paralysis">flaccid paralysis</span> and/or impaired ability to concentrate urine.</p>
<p>If potassium depletion associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030381" conceptname="Metabolic alkalosis">metabolic alkalosis</span> cannot be managed by correcting the fundamental cause of the deficiency, eg, where the patient requires long-term diuretic therapy, supplemental potassium in the form of high potassium food or potassium chloride may be able to restore normal potassium levels.</p>
<p>In rare circumstances (eg, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4070448" conceptname="Renal tubular acidosis">renal tubular acidosis</span>) potassium depletion may be associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4253927" conceptname="Hyperchloremia">hyperchloremia</span>.

<h1><span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span></h1>
<p class="First">Potassium supplements are contraindicated in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span> since a further increase in serum potassium concentration in such patients can produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">Hyperkalemia</span> may complicate any of the following conditions: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198185" conceptname="Chronic renal failure">chronic renal failure</span>, systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidosis</span>, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443727" conceptname="Diabetic ketoacidosis">diabetic acidosis</span>, acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435796" conceptname="Dehydration">dehydration</span>, extensive tissue breakdown as in severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022094" conceptname="Thermal burn">burns</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="193984" conceptname="Adrenal hypofunction">adrenal insufficiency</span>, or the administration of a potassium-sparing diuretic (eg, spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride) (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_aea88125-43e5-4392-9ac9-5464066d45ef">OVERDOSAGE</a></span>).</p>
<p>Controlled-release formulations of potassium chloride have produced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="25844" conceptname="Ulcer of esophagus">esophageal ulceration</span> in certain cardiac patients with esophageal compression due to enlarged left atrium. Potassium supplementation, when indicated in such patients, should be given as a liquid preparation or as an aqueous (water) suspension of Potassium Chloride (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_5c334042-4b34-42b1-b6f4-1d76c11a2141">PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients</a></span>, and <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_863f13a9-47ee-48bf-bc2a-9f4a2634d80a">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span> sections).</p>

This occurs most commonly in patients given potassium by the intravenous route but may also occur in patients given potassium orally. Potentially fatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span> can develop rapidly and be asymptomatic. The use of potassium salts in patients with chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>, or any other condition which impairs potassium excretion, requires particularly careful monitoring of the serum potassium concentration and appropriate dosage adjustment.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Interaction with Potassium-Sparing Diuretics<br></span><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">Hypokalemia</span> should not be treated by the concomitant administration of potassium salts and a potassium-sparing diuretic (eg, spironolactone, triamterene, or amiloride) since the simultaneous administration of these agents can produce severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Interaction with Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors<br></span>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (eg, captopril, enalapril) will produce some potassium retention by inhibiting aldosterone production. Potassium supplements should be given to patients receiving ACE inhibitors only with close monitoring.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal Lesions<br></span>Solid oral dosage forms of potassium chloride can produce ulcerative and/or stenotic lesions of the gastrointestinal tract. Based on spontaneous adverse reaction reports, enteric-coated preparations of potassium chloride are associated with an increased frequency of small bowel lesions (40-50 per 100,000 patient years) compared to sustained release wax matrix formulations (less than one per 100,000 patient years). Because of the lack of extensive marketing experience with microencapsulated products, a comparison between such products and wax matrix or enteric-coated products is not available. Potassium Chloride Extended Release Tablets USP, 20 mEq is a tablet formulated to provide a controlled rate of release of microencapsulated potassium chloride and thus to minimize the possibility of a high local concentration of potassium near the gastrointestinal wall.</p>
<p>Prospective trials have been conducted in normal human volunteers in which the upper gastrointestinal tract was evaluated by endoscopic inspection before and after 1 week of solid oral potassium chloride therapy. The ability of this model to predict events occurring in usual clinical practice is unknown. Trials which approximated usual clinical practice did not reveal any clear differences between the wax matrix and microencapsulated dosage forms. In contrast, there was a higher incidence of gastric and duodenal lesions in subjects receiving a high dose of a wax matrix controlled-release formulation under conditions which did not resemble usual or recommended clinical practice (ie, 96 mEq per day in divided doses of potassium chloride administered to fasted patients, in the presence of an anticholinergic drug to delay gastric emptying). The upper gastrointestinal lesions observed by endoscopy were asymptomatic and were not accompanied by evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> (Hemoccult testing). The relevance of these findings to the usual conditions (ie, non-fasting, no anticholinergic agent, smaller doses) under which controlled-release potassium chloride products are used is uncertain; epidemiologic studies have not identified an elevated risk, compared to microencapsulated products, for upper gastrointestinal lesions in patients receiving wax matrix formulations. Potassium Chloride Extended Release Tablets USP, 20 mEq should be discontinued immediately and the possibility of ulceration, obstruction, or perforation should be considered if severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218984" conceptname="Abdominal distension">distention</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">gastrointestinal bleeding</span> occurs.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">General</span></h2>
<p class="First">The diagnosis of potassium depletion is ordinarily made by demonstrating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span> in a patient with a clinical history suggesting some cause for potassium depletion. In interpreting the serum potassium level, the physician should bear in mind that acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438730" conceptname="Alkalosis">alkalosis</span> per se can produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span> in the absence of a deficit in total body potassium while <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acute acidosis</span> per se can increase the serum potassium concentration into the normal range even in the presence of a reduced total body potassium. The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidosis</span> requires careful attention to acid-base balance and appropriate monitoring of serum electrolytes, the electrocardiogram, and the clinical status of the patient.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Information for Patients</span></h2>
<p class="First">Physicians should consider reminding the patient of the following: To take each dose with meals and with a full glass of water or other liquid. To take each dose without crushing, chewing, or sucking the tablets. If those patients are having difficulty swallowing whole tablets, they may try one of the following alternate methods of administration:</p>
<ol class="LittleAlpha">
<li>Break the tablet in half, and take each half separately with a glass of water. 
</li>
<li>Prepare an aqueous (water) suspension as follows: <br>1.Â  Place the whole tablet(s) in approximately 1/2 glass of water (4 fluid ounces). <br>2.Â  Allow approximately 2 minutes for the tablet(s) to disintegrate. <br>3.Â  Stir for about half a minute after the tablet(s) has disintegrated. <br>4.Â  Swirl the suspension and consume the entire contents of the glass immediately by drinking or by the use of a straw. <br>5.Â  Add another 1 fluid ounce of water, swirl, and consume immediately. <br>6.Â  Then, add an additional 1 fluid ounce of water, swirl, and consume immediately.</li>
</ol>
<p>Aqueous suspension of Potassium Chloride that is not taken immediately should be discarded. The use of other liquids for suspending Potassium Chloride Extended Release Tablets USP, 20 mEq is not recommended.</p>
<p>To take this medicine following the frequency and amount prescribed by the physician. This is especially important if the patient is also taking diuretics and/or digitalis preparations.</p>
<p>To check with the physician at once if <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103703" conceptname="Melena">tarry stools</span> or other evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">gastrointestinal bleeding</span> is noticed.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span></h1>
<p class="First">The administration of oral potassium salts to persons with normal excretory mechanisms for potassium rarely causes serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span>. However, if excretory mechanisms are impaired or if potassium is administered too rapidly intravenously, potentially fatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span> can result (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_b608a548-5860-41d3-9b97-373e40581831">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_d3be0f50-d993-4bb4-b49f-b2102b187285">WARNINGS</a></span>). It is important to recognize that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span> is usually asymptomatic and may be manifested only by an increased serum potassium concentration (6.5-8.0 mEq/L) and characteristic electrocardiographic changes (peaking of T-waves, loss of P-waves, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> of S-T segment, and prolongation of the QT-interval). Late manifestations include muscle <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440377" conceptname="Paralysis">paralysis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443240" conceptname="Collapse">cardiovascular collapse</span> from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span> (9-12 mEq/L).</p>
<p>Treatment measures for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span> include the following:</p>
<ol class="Arabic">
<li>Patients should be closely monitored for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span> and electrolyte changes. 
</li>
<li>Elimination of foods and medications containing potassium and of any agents with potassium-sparing properties such as potassium-sparing diuretics, ARBS, ACE inhibitors, NSAIDS, certain nutritional supplements and many others. 
</li>
<li>Intravenous calcium gluconate if the patient is at no risk of developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">digitalis toxicity</span>. 
</li>
<li>Intravenous administration of 300 to 500 mL/hr of 10% dextrose solution containing 10-20 units of crystalline insulin per 1,000 mL. 
</li>
<li>Correction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidosis</span>, if present, with intravenous sodium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span>. 
</li>
<li>Use of exchange resins, hemodialysis, or peritoneal dialysis.</li>
</ol>
<p>In treating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span>, it should be recalled that in patients who have been stabilized on digitalis, too rapid a lowering of the serum potassium concentration can produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">digitalis toxicity</span>.</p>
<p>The extended release feature means that absorption and toxic effects may be delayed for hours.<br>Consider standard measures to remove any unabsorbed drug.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span></h1>
<p class="First">The usual dietary intake of potassium by the average adult is 50 to 100 mEq per day. Potassium depletion sufficient to cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span> usually requires the loss of 200 or more mEq of potassium from the total body store.</p>
<p>Dosage must be adjusted to the individual needs of each patient. The dose for the prevention of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span> is typically in the range of 20 mEq per day. Doses of 40-100 mEq per day or more are used for the treatment of potassium depletion. Dosage should be divided if more than 20 mEq per day is given such that no more than 20 mEq is given in a single dose.</p>
<p>Each Potassium Chloride Extended Release Tablet USP, 20 mEq provides 20 mEq of potassium chloride.</p>
<p>Potassium Chloride Extended Release Tablets USP, 20 mEq should be taken with meals and with a glass of water or other liquid. This product should not be taken on an empty stomach because of its potential for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002232" conceptname="Epigastric discomfort">gastric irritation</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_d3be0f50-d993-4bb4-b49f-b2102b187285">WARNINGS</a></span>).</p>
<p>Patients having difficulty swallowing whole tablets may try one of the following alternate methods of administration:</p>
<ol class="LittleAlpha">
<li>Break the tablet in half, and take each half separately with a glass of water. 
</li>
<li>Prepare an aqueous (water) suspension as follows: 
<ul class="Circle">
<li>Place the whole tablet(s) in approximately 1/2 glass of water (4 fluid ounces). 
</li>
<li>Allow approximately 2 minutes for the tablet(s) to disintegrate. 
</li>
<li>Stir for about half a minute after the tablet(s) has disintegrated. 
</li>
<li>Swirl the suspension and consume the entire contents of the glass immediately by drinking or by the use of a straw. 
</li>
<li>Add another 1 fluid ounce of water, swirl, and consume immediately. 
</li>
<li>Then, add an additional 1 fluid ounce of water, swirl, and consume immediately.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Aqueous suspension of Potassium Chloride that is not taken immediately should be discarded. The use of other liquids for suspending Potassium Chloride Extended Release Tablets USP, 20 mEq is not recommended.</p>
