<h2>WARNING</h2>
<p class="First">Severe and sometimes fatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> associated with isoniazid therapy may occur and may develop even after many months of treatment. The risk of developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> is age related. Approximate case rates by age are: 0 per 1,000 for persons under 20 years of age, 3 per 1,000 for persons in the 20-34 year age group, 12 per 1,000 for persons in the 35-49 year age group, 23 per 1,000 for persons in the 50-64 year age group, and 8 per 1,000 for persons over 65 years of age. The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> is increased with daily consumption of alcohol. Precise data to provide a fatality rate for isoniazid-related <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> is not available; however, in a U.S. Public Health Service Surveillance Study of 13,838 persons taking isoniazid, there were 8 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> among 174 cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, patients given isoniazid should be carefully monitored and interviewed at monthly intervals. Serum transaminase concentration becomes elevated in about 10-20 percent of patients, usually during the first few months of therapy, but it can occur at any time. Usually enzyme levels return to normal despite continuance of drug, but in some cases progressive liver dysfunction occurs. Patients should be instructed to report immediately any of the prodromal symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span>, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">weakness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4272240" conceptname="Malaise">malaise</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">anorexia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>. If these symptoms appear or if signs suggestive of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">hepatic damage</span> are detected, isoniazid should be discontinued promptly, since continued use of the drug in these cases has been reported to cause a more severe form of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver damage</span>.</p>
<p>Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span> should be given appropriate treatment with alternative drugs. If isoniazid must be reinstituted, it should be reinstituted only after symptoms and laboratory abnormalities have cleared. The drug should be restarted in very small and gradually increasing doses and should be withdrawn immediately if there is any indication of recurrent liver involvement. Treatment should be deferred in persons with acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic diseases</span>.</p>

<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Rifampin/Isoniazid is a combination capsule containing 300 mg rifampin and 150 mg isoniazid. Each capsule for oral administration, contain the following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, corn starch, lactose monohydrate,magnesium stearate, and pregelatinized starch.</p>
<p>Capsule shell contains: FD&amp;C blue #1, FD&amp;C red #40, gelatin and titanium dioxide.</p>
<p>The printing ink contains: ammonium hydroxide, isopropyl alcohol, N-butyl alcohol, pharmaceutical glaze, propylene glycol, simethicone, and titanium dioxide.</p>
<p>Rifampin is a semisynthetic antibiotic derivative of rifamycin B. The chemical name for rifampin is 3-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyliminomethyl) rifamycin SV.</p>
<p>Isoniazid is the hydrazide of isonicotinic acid. It exists as colorless or white crystals or as a white crystalline powderthat is water soluble, odorless and slowly affected by exposure to air and light.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Underline">Rifampin</span></span></p>
<p>Rifampin inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity in susceptible cells. Specifically, it interacts with bacterialRNA polymerase but does not inhibit the mammalian enzyme. This is the mechanism of action by which rifampinexerts its therapeutic effect. Rifampin cross resistance has only been shown with other rifamycins.</p>
<p>In a study of 14 normal human adult males, peak blood levels of rifampin occurred 1Â½ to 3 hours following oraladministration of two rifampin and isoniazid capsules. The peaks ranged from 6.9 to 14 mcg/ml with an average of10 mcg/ml.</p>
<p>In normal subjects the TÂ½ (biological half-life) of rifampin in blood is approximately 3 hours. Elimination occursmainly through the bile and, to a much lesser extent, the urine.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Underline">Isoniazid</span></span></p>
<p>Isoniazid acts against actively growing tubercle bacilli.</p>
<p>After oral administration isoniazid produces peak blood levels within 1 to 2 hours which decline to 50% or lesswithin 6 hours. It diffuses readily into all body fluids (cerebrospinal, pleural, and ascitic fluids), tissues, organs,and excreta (saliva, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4102774" conceptname="Productive cough">sputum</span>, and feces). The drug also passes through the placental barrier and into milk inconcentrations comparable to those in the plasma. From 50 to 70% of a dose of isoniazid is excreted in the urine in 24 hours.</p>
<p>Isoniazid is metabolized primarily by acetylation and dehydrazination. The rate of acetylation is genetically determined.Approximately 50% of Blacks and Caucasians are "slow inactivators"; the majority of Eskimos and Orientalsare "rapid inactivators."</p>
<p>The rate of acetylation does not significantly alter the effectiveness of isoniazid. However, slow acetylation maylead to higher blood levels of the drug, and thus an increase in toxic reactions.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435787" conceptname="Vitamin B6 deficiency">Pyridoxine deficiency</span> (B6) is sometimes observed in adults with high doses of isoniazid and is considered probablydue to its competition with pyridoxal phosphate for the enzyme apotryptophanase.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First">Rifampin and isoniazid capsules are a combination of two drugs, each of which has been associated with liverdysfunction. Liver function tests should be performed prior to therapy with rifampin/isoniazid and periodicallyduring treatment.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Underline">Rifampin</span></span></p>
<p>Rifampin has been shown to produce liver dysfunction. There have been fatalities associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span> inpatients with liver disease or receiving rifampin concomitantly with other hepatoxic agents. Since an increased riskmay exist for individuals with liver disease, benefits must be weighed carefully against the risk of further <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver damage</span>.</p>
<p>Several studies of tumorigenicity potential have been done in rodents. In one <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span> of mice known to be particularlysusceptible to the spontaneous development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4101758" conceptname="Hepatocellular carcinoma">hepatomas</span>, rifampin given at a level 2-10 times the maximumdosage used clinically resulted in a significant increase in the occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4101758" conceptname="Hepatocellular carcinoma">hepatomas</span> in female mice of this strainafter one year of administration.</p>
<p>There was no evidence of tumorigenicity in the males of this <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span>, in males or females of another mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span>, orin rats.</p>

<h2><span class="Underline">Rifampin</span></h2>
<p class="First">Rifampin is not recommended for intermittent therapy; the patient should be cautioned against intentional oraccidental interruption of the daily dosage regimen since rare renal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span> have been reportedwhen therapy was resumed in such cases.</p>
<p>Rifampin has been observed to increase the requirements for anticoagulant drugs of the coumarin type. The causeof the phenomenon is unknown. In patients receiving anticoagulants and rifampin concurrently, it is recommendedthat the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time be performed daily or as frequently as necessary to establish and maintain the requireddose of anticoagulant. Urine, feces, saliva, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4102774" conceptname="Productive cough">sputum</span>, sweat, and tears may be colored red-orange by rifampin and itsmetabolites. Soft contact lenses may be permanently stained. Individuals to be treated should be made aware of these possibilities.</p>
<p>It has been reported that the reliability of oral contraceptives may be affected in some patients being treated fortuberculosis with rifampin in combination with at least one other antituberculosis drug. In such cases, alternativecontraceptive measures may need to be considered.</p>
<p>It has also been reported that rifampin given in combination with other antituberculosis drugs may decrease thepharmacologic activity of methadone, oral hypoglycemics, digitoxin, quinidine, disopyramide, dapsone, and corticosteroids.In these cases, dosage adjustment of the interacting drugs is recommended.</p>
<p>Therapeutic levels of rifampin have been shown to inhibit standard microbiological assays for serum folate andvitamin B12. Alternative methods must be considered when determining folate and vitamin B12 concentrations inthe presence of rifampin.</p>
<p>Since rifampin has been reported to cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood and in maternal milk,neonates and newborns of rifampin-treated mothers should be carefully observed for any evidence of untowardeffects.</p>

<h2><span class="Underline">Isoniazid</span></h2>
<p class="First">All drugs should be stopped and an evaluation of the patient should be made at the first sign of a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reaction</span>.</p>
<p>Use of isoniazid should be carefully monitored in the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Patients who are receiving phenytoin (diphenylhydantoin) concurrently. Isoniazid may decrease the excretion of phenytoin or may enhance its effects. To avoid phenytoin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>, appropriate adjustment of the anticonvulsant dose should be made.</li>
<li>Daily users of alcohol. Daily ingestion of alcohol may be associated with a higher incidence of isoniazid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span>.</li>
<li>Patients with current <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">chronic liver disease</span> or severe renal dysfunction.</li>
</ol>
<p>Periodic ophthalmoscopic examination during isoniazid therapy is recommended when visual symptoms occur.</p>

<h2>Usage in Pregnancy and Lactation</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Underline">Rifampin</span></span></p>
<p>Although rifampin has been reported to cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood, the effect of rifampin,alone or in combination with other antituberculosis drugs, on the human fetus is not known. An increase in congenitalmalformations, primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4283381" conceptname="Spina bifida">spina bifida</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135923" conceptname="Cleft palate">cleft palate</span>, has been reported in the offspring of rodents given oral dosesof 150 to 250 mg/kg/day of rifampin during pregnancy.</p>
<p>The possible teratogenic potential in women capable of bearing children should be carefully weighed against thebenefits of therapy.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Underline">Isoniazid</span></span></p>
<p>It has been reported that in both rats and rabbits, isoniazid may exert an embryocidal effect when administeredorally during pregnancy, although no isoniazid-related congenital anomalies have been found in reproductionstudies in mammalian species (mice, rats, and rabbits). Isoniazid should be prescribed during pregnancy onlywhen therapeutically necessary. The benefit of preventive therapy should be weighed against a possible risk to thefetus. Preventive treatment generally should be started after delivery because of the increased risk of tuberculosisfor new mothers.</p>
<p>Since isoniazid is known to cross the placental barrier and to pass into maternal breast milk, neonates and breastfedinfants of isoniazid treated mothers should be carefully observed for any evidence of adverse effects.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Underline">Rifampin</span></span></p>

Brownish-red or orange discoloration ofthe skin, urine, sweat, saliva, tears, and feces is proportional to amount ingested.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197676" conceptname="Large liver">Liver enlargement</span>, possibly with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4082445" conceptname="Tenderness">tenderness</span>, can develop within a few hours after severe overdosage, and jaundicemay develop rapidly. Hepatic involvement may be more marked in patients with prior impairment of hepatic function.Other physical findings remain essentially normal.</p>
<p>Direct and total bilirubin levels may increase rapidly with severe overdosage; hepatic enzyme levels may be affected, especially with prior impairment of hepatic function. A direct effect upon hemopoietic system, electrolyte levels, or acid-base balance is unlikely.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Underline">Isoniazid</span></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Signs and Symptoms: </span>Isoniazid overdosage produces signs and symptoms within 30 minutes to 3 hours. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">Nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, slurring of speech, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079185" conceptname="Hazy vision">blurring of vision</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275889" conceptname="Visual hallucinations">visual hallucinations</span> (including bright colors and strangedesigns), are among the early manifestations.

<p><span class="Bold">Treatment</span></p>
<p>The airway should be secured and adequate respiratory exchange established. Only then should gastric emptying(lavage-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span>) be attempted; this may be difficult because of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>. Since <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> are likely tobe present, gastric lavage is probably preferable to induction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span>.</p>
<p>Activated charcoal slurry instilled into the stomach following evacuation of gastric contents can help absorb anyremaining drug in the GI tract. Antiemetic medication may be required to control severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>.</p>
<p>Blood samples should be obtained for immediate determination of gases, electrolytes, BUN, glucose, etc. Bloodshould be typed and cross matched in preparation for possible hemodialysis.</p>
<p>Rapid control of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span> is fundamental to management. Intravenous sodium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span> should begiven at once and repeated as needed, adjusting subsequent dosage on the basis of laboratory findings (i.e., serumsodium, pH, etc.). At the same time, anticonvulsants should be given intravenously (i.e., barbiturates, diphenylhydantoin, diazepam) as required, and large doses of intravenous pyridoxine.</p>
<p>Forced osmotic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span> must be started early and should be continued for some hours after clinical improvementto hasten renal clearance of drug and help prevent relapse. Fluid intake and output should be monitored.</p>
<p>Bile drainage may be indicated in presence of serious impairment of hepatic function lasting more than 24-48hours. Under these circumstances and for severe cases, extracorporeal hemodialysis may be required; if this is notavailable, peritoneal dialysis can be used along with forced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span>.</p>
<p>Along with measures based on initial and repeated determination of blood gases and other laboratory tests as needed,meticulous respiratory and other intensive care should be utilized to protect against <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span>,<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="253506" conceptname="Pneumonitis">pneumonitis</span>, etc.</p>
<p>In patients with previously adequate hepatic function, reversal of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197676" conceptname="Large liver">liver enlargement</span> and impaired hepatic excretoryfunction probably will be noted within 72 hours, with rapid return toward normal thereafter.</p>
<p>Untreated or inadequately treated cases of gross isoniazid overdosage can terminate fatally, but good response hasbeen reported in most patients brought under adequate treatment within the first few hours after drug ingestion.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">In general, therapy should be continued until bacterial conversion and maximal improvement have occurred.</p>
<p>Adults: Two Rifampin and Isoniazid Capsules, USP (600 mg rifampin, 300 mg isoniazid) once daily, administeredone hour before or two hours after a meal.</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of pyridoxine (B6) is recommended in the malnourished, in those predisposed toneuropathy (e.g., diabetic), and in adolescents.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Underline">Susceptibility Testing, Rifampin</span></span></p>
<p>Rifampin susceptibility powders are available for both direct and indirect methods of determining the susceptibility of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of mycobacteria. The MIC's of susceptible clinical isolates when determined in 7H10 or other non-eggcontainingmedia have ranged from 0.1 to 2 mcg/mL. Quantitative methods that require measurement of zonediameters give the most precise estimates of antibiotic susceptibility. One such procedure has been recommendedfor use with discs for testing susceptibility to rifampin. Interpretations correlate zone diameters from the disc testwith MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) values for rifampin.</p>
