<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Alprazolam is a triazolo analog of the 1,4 benzodiazepine class of central nervous system-active compounds. The chemical name of alprazolam is 8-Chloro-1-methyl-6-phenyl-4<span class="Italics">H</span>-<span class="Italics">s</span>-triazolo [4,3-Î±] [1,4] benzodiazepine. The structural formula is:</p>

<p>Alprazolam is a white to off-white crystalline powder, which is soluble in alcohol but which has no appreciable solubility in water at physiological pH.</p>
<p>Each alprazolam tablet, for oral administration, contains 0.25, 0.5, or 1 mg of alprazolam. Inactive ingredients: docusate sodium, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, pregelatinized starch, and sodium benzoate. Additionally, the <span class="Bold">0.5 mg</span> also contains FD &amp; C Yellow #6 Aluminum Lake, and the <span class="Bold">1 mg</span> also contains FD &amp; C Blue #2 Aluminum Lake.</p>

<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">CNS agents of the 1,4 benzodiazepine class presumably exert their effects by binding at stereo specific receptors at several sites within the central nervous system. Their exact mechanism of action is unknown. Clinically, all benzodiazepines cause a dose-related central nervous system depressant activity varying from mild impairment of task performance to hypnosis.</p>

<h3>Absorption</h3>
<p class="First">Following oral administration, alprazolam is readily absorbed. Peak concentrations in the plasma occur in one to two hours following administration. Plasma levels are proportionate to the dose given; over the dose range of 0.5 to 3 mg, peak levels of 8 to 37 ng/mL were observed. Using a specific assay methodology, the mean plasma elimination half-life of alprazolam has been found to be about 11.2 hours (range: 6.3 to 26.9 hours) in healthy adults.</p>

<h3>Distribution</h3>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro</span>, alprazolam is bound (80 percent) to human serum protein. Serum albumin accounts for the majority of the binding.</p>
</div>

<h3>Metabolism/Elimination</h3>
<p class="First">Alprazolam is extensively metabolized in humans, primarily by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), to two major metabolites in the plasma: 4-hydroxyalprazolam and Î±-hydroxyalprazolam. A benzophenone derived from alprazolam is also found in humans. Their half-lives appear to be similar to that of alprazolam. The plasma concentrations of 4-hydroxyalprazolam and Î±-hydroxyalprazolam relative to unchanged alprazolam concentration were always less than 4%. The reported relative potencies in benzodiazepine receptor binding experiments and in animal models of induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> inhibition are 0.2 and 0.66, respectively, for 4-hydroxyalprazolam and Î±-hydroxyalprazolam. Such low concentrations and the lesser potencies of 4-hydroxyalprazolam and Î±-hydroxyalprazolam suggest that they are unlikely to contribute much to the pharmacological effects of alprazolam. The benzophenone metabolite is essentially inactive. </p>
<p>Alprazolam and its metabolites are excreted primarily in the urine.</p>

<h2>Special Populations</h2>
<p class="First">Changes in the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of benzodiazepines have been reported in a variety of disease states including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218106" conceptname="Alcoholism">alcoholism</span>, impaired hepatic function and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>. Changes have also been demonstrated in geriatric patients. A mean half-life of alprazolam of 16.3 hours has been observed in healthy elderly subjects (range: 9 to 26.9 hours, n = 16) compared to 11 hours (range: 6.3 to 15.8 hours, n = 16) in healthy adult subjects. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201612" conceptname="Alcoholic liver damage">alcoholic liver disease</span> the half-life of alprazolam ranged between 5.8 and 65.3 hours (mean: 19.7 hours, n = 17) as compared to between 6.3 and 26.9 hours (mean = 11.4 hours, n = 17) in healthy subjects. In an obese group of subjects the half-life of alprazolam ranged between 9.9 and 40.4 hours (mean = 21.8 hours, n = 12) as compared to between 6.3 and 15.8 hours (mean = 10.6 hours, n = 12) in healthy subjects.</p>
<p>Because of its similarity to other benzodiazepines, it is assumed that alprazolam undergoes transplacental passage and that it is excreted in human milk.</p>

<h2>Drug-Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Alprazolam is primarily eliminated by metabolism via cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). Most of the interactions that have been documented with alprazolam are with drugs that inhibit or induce CYP3A4.</p>
<p>Compounds that are potent inhibitors of CYP3A would be expected to increase plasma alprazolam concentrations. Drug products that have been studied <span class="Italics">in vivo</span>, along with their effect on increasing alprazolam AUC, are as follows: ketoconazole, 3.98 fold; itraconazole, 2.7 fold; nefazodone, 1.98 fold; fluvoxamine, 1.96 fold; and erythromycin, 1.61 fold (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_contraindications_ID_BC249000-1F22-42E0-A7D5-151D946F688A">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>, <a href="#i4i_warnings_ID_ADD132A3-C934-41A5-BE7F-BF830C01321F">WARNINGS</a>,</span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_precautions_ID_4B2F0E73-1B34-40E7-8652-63344984C4DD">PRECAUTIONS</a>: <a href="#i4i_drug_interaction_ID_887DFFB8-3D90-4FCE-A5E6-285F75FA18B1">Drug Interactions</a></span>).</p>
<p>CYP3A inducers would be expected to decrease alprazolam concentrations and this has been observed <span class="Italics">in vivo</span>. The oral clearance of alprazolam (given in a 0.8 mg single dose) was increased from 0.9Â±0.21 mL/min/kg to 2.13Â±0.54 mL/min/kg and the elimination t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> was shortened (from 17.1Â±4.9 to 7.7 Â±1.7 h) following administration of 300 mg/day carbamazepine for 10 days (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_precautions_ID_4B2F0E73-1B34-40E7-8652-63344984C4DD">PRECAUTIONS</a>: <a href="#i4i_drug_interaction_ID_887DFFB8-3D90-4FCE-A5E6-285F75FA18B1">Drug Interactions</a></span>). However, the carbamazepine dose used in this study was fairly low compared to the recommended doses (1000 to 1200 mg/day); the effect at usual carbamazepine doses is unknown.</p>
<p>The ability of alprazolam to induce human hepatic enzyme systems has not yet been determined. However, this is not a property of benzodiazepines in general. Further, alprazolam did not affect the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> or plasma warfarin levels in male volunteers administered sodium warfarin orally.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">Panic Disorder</span></h2>
<p class="First">Support for the effectiveness of alprazolam in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> came from three short-term, placebo-controlled studies (up to 10 weeks) in patients with diagnoses closely corresponding to DSM-III-R criteria for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span>.</p>
<p>The average dose of alprazolam was 5 to 6 mg/day in two of the studies, and the doses of alprazolam were fixed at 2 and 6 mg/day in the third study. In all three studies, alprazolam was superior to placebo on a variable defined as â€œthe number of patients with zero panic attacksâ€? (range, 37 to 83% met this criterion), as well as on a global improvement score. In two of the three studies, alprazolam was superior to placebo on a variable defined as â€œchange from baseline on the number of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021498" conceptname="Panic attack">panic attacks</span> per weekâ€? (range, 3.3 to 5.2), and also on a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440985" conceptname="Phobia">phobia</span> rating scale. A subgroup of patients who were improved on alprazolam during short-term treatment in one of these trials was continued on an open basis up to 8 months, without apparent loss of benefit.</p>

<p class="First">Certain adverse clinical events, some life-threatening, are a direct consequence of physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> to alprazolam. These include a spectrum of withdrawal symptoms; the most important is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_abuse_dependence_ID_46EF1F27-3AF7-4566-BE26-55A2F246690D">DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></a></span>). Even after relatively short-term use at the doses recommended for the treatment of transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442077" conceptname="Anxiety disorder">anxiety disorder</span> (i.e., 0.75 to 4 mg per day), there is some risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>. Spontaneous reporting system data suggest that the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> and its severity appear to be greater in patients treated with doses greater than 4 mg/day and for long periods (more than 12 weeks). However, in a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> patients, the duration of treatment (3 months compared to 6 months) had no effect on the ability of patients to taper to zero dose.

<h3>The importance of dose and the risks of alprazolam as a treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span></h3>
<p class="First">Because the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> often requires the use of average daily doses of alprazolam above 4 mg, the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> among <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> patients may be higher than that among those treated for less severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>. Experience in randomized placebo-controlled discontinuation studies of patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> showed a high rate of rebound and withdrawal symptoms in patients treated with alprazolam compared to placebo-treated patients.</p>
<p>Relapse or return of illness was defined as a return of symptoms characteristic of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> (primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021498" conceptname="Panic attack">panic attacks</span>) to levels approximately equal to those seen at baseline before active treatment was initiated. Rebound refers to a return of symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> to a level substantially greater in frequency, or more severe in intensity than seen at baseline. Withdrawal symptoms were identified as those which were generally not characteristic of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> and which occurred for the first time more frequently during discontinuation than at baseline.</p>
<p>In a controlled clinical trial in which 63 patients were randomized to alprazolam and where withdrawal symptoms were specifically sought, the following were identified as symptoms of withdrawal: heightened sensory perception, impaired concentration, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="444223" conceptname="Sense of smell altered">dysosmia</span>, clouded sensorium, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4193492" conceptname="Acroparesthesia">paresthesias</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75635" conceptname="Cramp">muscle cramps</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4247265" conceptname="Muscle twitch">muscle twitch</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079185" conceptname="Hazy vision">blurred vision</span>, appetite decrease, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span>. Other symptoms, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, were frequently seen during discontinuation, but it could not be determined if they were due to return of illness, rebound, or withdrawal.</p>
<p>In two controlled trials of 6 to 8 weeks duration where the ability of patients to discontinue medication was measured, 71% to 93% of patients treated with alprazolam tapered completely off therapy compared to 89% to 96% of placebo-treated patients. In a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> patients, the duration of treatment (3 months compared to 6 months) had no effect on the ability of patients to taper to zero dose.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">Seizures</span> attributable to alprazolam were seen after drug discontinuance or dose reduction in 8 of 1980 patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> or in patients participating in clinical trials where doses of alprazolam greater than 4 mg/day for over 3 months were permitted. Five of these cases clearly occurred during abrupt dose reduction, or discontinuation from daily doses of 2 to 10 mg. Three cases occurred in situations where there was not a clear relationship to abrupt dose reduction or discontinuation. In one instance, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> occurred after discontinuation from a single dose of 1 mg after tapering at a rate of 1 mg every 3 days from 6 mg daily. In two other instances, the relationship to taper is indeterminate; in both of these cases the patients had been receiving doses of 3 mg daily prior to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span>. The duration of use in the above 8 cases ranged from 4 to 22 weeks. There have been occasional voluntary reports of patients developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> while apparently tapering gradually from alprazolam. The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> seems to be greatest 24 to 72 hours after discontinuation (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_ID_6E11A07E-069E-4F8F-A823-F12A3594C7C6">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span> for recommended tapering and discontinuation schedule).</p>

<h2>Interdose Symptoms</h2>
<p class="First">Early morning <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> and emergence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> symptoms between doses of alprazolam have been reported in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> taking prescribed maintenance doses of alprazolam. These symptoms may reflect the development of tolerance or a time interval between doses which is longer than the duration of clinical action of the administered dose. In either case, it is presumed that the prescribed dose is not sufficient to maintain plasma levels above those needed to prevent relapse, rebound or withdrawal symptoms over the entire course of the interdosing interval. In these situations, it is recommended that the same total daily dose be given divided as more frequent administrations (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_ID_6E11A07E-069E-4F8F-A823-F12A3594C7C6">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>

<h2>Risk of Dose Reduction</h2>
<p class="First">Withdrawal reactions may occur when dosage reduction occurs for any reason. This includes purposeful tapering, but also inadvertent reduction of dose (e.g., the patient forgets, the patient is admitted to a hospital). Therefore, the dosage of alprazolam should be reduced or discontinued gradually (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_ID_6E11A07E-069E-4F8F-A823-F12A3594C7C6">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS Depression</span> and Impaired Performance</h2>
<p class="First">Because of its CNS depressant effects, patients receiving alprazolam should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations or activities requiring complete mental alertness such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. For the same reason, patients should be cautioned about the simultaneous ingestion of alcohol and other CNS depressant drugs during treatment with alprazolam.</p>

<h2>Risk of Fetal Harm</h2>
<p class="First">Benzodiazepines can potentially cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. If alprazolam is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Because of experience with other members of the benzodiazepine class, alprazolam is assumed to be capable of causing an increased risk of congenital abnormalities when administered to a pregnant woman during the first trimester. Because use of these drugs is rarely a matter of urgency, their use during the first trimester should almost always be avoided. The possibility that a woman of childbearing potential may be pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. Patients should be advised that if they become pregnant during therapy or intend to become pregnant they should communicate with their physicians about the desirability of discontinuing the drug.</p>

<h2>Alprazolam Interaction With Drugs That Inhibit Metabolism Via Cytochrome P450 3A</h2>
<p class="First">The initial step in alprazolam metabolism is hydroxylation catalyzed by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). Drugs that inhibit this metabolic pathway may have a profound effect on the clearance of alprazolam. Consequently, alprazolam should be avoided in patients receiving very potent inhibitors of CYP3A. With drugs inhibiting CYP3A to a lesser but still significant degree, alprazolam should be used only with caution and consideration of appropriate dosage reduction. For some drugs, an interaction with alprazolam has been quantified with clinical data; for other drugs, interactions are predicted from <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> data and/or experience with similar drugs in the same pharmacologic class.</p>
<p>The following are examples of drugs known to inhibit the metabolism of alprazolam and/or related benzodiazepines, presumably through inhibition of CYP3A.</p>

<h3>Azole Antifungal Agents</h3>
<p class="First">Ketoconazole and itraconazole are potent CYP3A inhibitors and have been shown <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> to increase plasma alprazolam concentrations 3.98 fold and 2.7 fold, respectively. The coadministration of alprazolam with these agents is not recommended. Other azole-type antifungal agents should also be considered potent CYP3A inhibitors and the coadministration of alprazolam with them is not recommended (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_contraindications_ID_BC249000-1F22-42E0-A7D5-151D946F688A">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span>).</p>

<h3>For All Users of Alprazolam</h3>
<p class="First">To assure safe and effective use of benzodiazepines, all patients prescribed alprazolam should be provided with the following guidance.</p>
<ol>
<li>Inform your physician about any alcohol consumption and medicine you are taking now, including medication you may buy without a prescription. Alcohol should generally not be used during treatment with benzodiazepines.</li>
<li>Not recommended for use in pregnancy. Therefore, inform your physician if you are pregnant, if you are planning to have a child, or if you become pregnant while you are taking this medication.</li>
<li>Inform your physician if you are nursing.</li>
<li>Until you experience how this medication affects you, do not drive a car or operate potentially dangerous machinery, etc.</li>
<li>Do not increase the dose even if you think the medication â€œdoes not work anymoreâ€? without consulting your physician. Benzodiazepines, even when used as recommended, may produce emotional and/or physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>.</li>
<li>Do not stop taking this medication abruptly or decrease the dose without consulting your physician, since withdrawal symptoms can occur.</li>

<h3>Additional advice for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> patients</h3>
<p class="First">The use of alprazolam at doses greater than 4 mg/day, often necessary to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span>, is accompanied by risks that you need to carefully consider. When used at doses greater than 4 mg/day, which may or may not be required for your treatment, alprazolam has the potential to cause severe emotional and physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> in some patients and these patients may find it exceedingly difficult to terminate treatment. In two controlled trials of 6 to 8 weeks duration where the ability of patients to discontinue medication was measured, 7 to 29% of patients treated with alprazolam did not completely taper off therapy. In a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> patients, the patients treated with doses of alprazolam greater than 4 mg/day had more difficulty tapering to zero dose than patients treated with less than 4 mg/day. In all cases, it is important that your physician help you discontinue this medication in a careful and safe manner to avoid overly extended use of alprazolam.</p>
<p>In addition, the extended use at doses greater than 4 mg/day appears to increase the incidence and severity of withdrawal reactions when alprazolam is discontinued. These are generally minor but <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> can occur, especially if you reduce the dose too rapidly or discontinue the medication abruptly. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">Seizure</span> can be life-threatening.</p>

<h3>Use with Other CNS Depressants</h3>
<p class="First">If alprazolam tablets are to be combined with other psychotropic agents or anticonvulsant drugs, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents to be employed, particularly with compounds which might potentiate the action of benzodiazepines. The benzodiazepines, including alprazolam, produce additive CNS depressant effects when co-administered with other psychotropic medications, anticonvulsants, antihistaminics, ethanol and other drugs which themselves produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span>.</p>

<h3>Use with Imipramine and Desipramine</h3>
<p class="First">The steady state plasma concentrations of imipramine and desipramine have been reported to be increased an average of 31% and 20%, respectively, by the concomitant administration of alprazolam tablets in doses up to 4 mg/day. The clinical significance of these changes is unknown.</p>

<h3>Drugs that inhibit alprazolam metabolism via cytochrome P450 3A</h3>
<p class="First">The initial step in alprazolam metabolism is hydroxylation catalyzed by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). Drugs which inhibit this metabolic pathway may have a profound effect on the clearance of alprazolam (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_contraindications_ID_BC249000-1F22-42E0-A7D5-151D946F688A">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_warnings_ID_ADD132A3-C934-41A5-BE7F-BF830C01321F">WARNINGS</a></span> for additional drugs of this type).</p>

<h3>Drugs and other substances demonstrated to be CYP3A  inhibitors on the basis of clinical studies involving benzodiazepines metabolized similarly to alprazolam or on the basis of in vitro studies with alprazolam or other benzodiazepines (caution is recommended during coadministration with alprazolam)</h3>
<p class="First">Available data from clinical studies of benzodiazepines other than alprazolam suggest a possible drug interaction with alprazolam for the following: diltiazem, isoniazid, macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin and clarithromycin, and grapefruit juice. Data from <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies of alprazolam suggest a possible drug interaction with alprazolam for the following: sertraline and paroxetine. However, data from an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> drug interaction study involving a single dose of alprazolam 1 mg and steady state dose of sertraline (50 to 150 mg/day) did not reveal any clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of alprazolam. Data from <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies of benzodiazepines other than alprazolam suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: ergotamine, cyclosporine, amiodarone, nicardipine, and nifedipine. Caution is recommended during the coadministration of any of these with alprazolam (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_warnings_ID_ADD132A3-C934-41A5-BE7F-BF830C01321F">WARNINGS</a></span>).</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">No evidence of carcinogenic potential was observed during 2-year bioassay studies of alprazolam in rats at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day (150 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of 10 mg/day) and in mice at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (50 times the maximum recommended daily human dose).</p>
<p>Alprazolam was not mutagenic in the rat micronucleus test at doses up to 100 mg/kg, which is 500 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of 10 mg/day. Alprazolam also was not mutagenic <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> in the DNA Damage/Alkaline Elution Assay or the Ames Assay.</p>
<p>Alprazolam produced no impairment of fertility in rats at doses up to 5 mg/kg/day, which is 25 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of 10 mg/day.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Side effects to alprazolam tablets, if they occur, are generally observed at the beginning of therapy and usually disappear upon continued medication. In the usual patient, the most frequent side effects are likely to be an extension of the pharmacological activity of alprazolam, eg, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> or light-headedness.</p>
<p>The data cited in the two tables below are estimates of untoward clinical event incidence among patients who participated under the following clinical conditions: relatively short duration (ie, four weeks) placebo-controlled clinical studies with dosages up to 4 mg/day of alprazolam (for the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442077" conceptname="Anxiety disorder">anxiety disorders</span> or for the short-term relief of the symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>) and short-term (up to ten weeks) placebo-controlled clinical studies with dosages up to 10 mg/day of alprazolam in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span>, with or without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4321835" conceptname="Agoraphobia">agoraphobia</span>.</p>
<p>These data cannot be used to predict precisely the incidence of untoward events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics, and other factors often differ from those in clinical trials. These figures cannot be compared with those obtained from other clinical studies involving related drug products and placebo as each group of drug trials are conducted under a different set of conditions.</p>
<p>Comparison of the cited figures, however, can provide the prescriber with some basis for estimating the relative contributions of drug and non-drug factors to the untoward event incidence in the population studied. Even this use must be approached cautiously, as a drug may relieve a symptom in one patient but induce it in others. (For example, an anxiolytic drug may relieve <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226991" conceptname="Aptyalism">dry mouth</span> [a symptom of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>] in some subjects but induce it [an untoward event] in others.)</p>
<p>Additionally, for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442077" conceptname="Anxiety disorder">anxiety disorders</span> the cited figures can provide the prescriber with an indication as to the frequency with which physician intervention (eg, increased surveillance, decreased dosage or discontinuation of drug therapy) may be necessary because of the untoward clinical event.</p>

<p>From the studies cited, it has not been determined whether these symptoms are clearly related to the dose and duration of therapy with alprazolam in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span>. There have also been reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218977" conceptname="Drug withdrawal seizure">withdrawal seizures</span> upon rapid decrease or abrupt discontinuation of alprazolam tablets (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_warnings_ID_ADD132A3-C934-41A5-BE7F-BF830C01321F">WARNINGS</a></span>).</p>
<p>To discontinue treatment in patients taking alprazolam, the dosage should be reduced slowly in keeping with good medical practice. It is suggested that the daily dosage of alprazolam be decreased by no more than 0.5 mg every three days (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_ID_6E11A07E-069E-4F8F-A823-F12A3594C7C6">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>). Some patients may benefit from an even slower dosage reduction. In a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> patients which compared this recommended taper schedule with a slower taper schedule, no difference was observed between the groups in the proportion of patients who tapered to zero dose; however, the slower schedule was associated with a reduction in symptoms associated with a withdrawal syndrome.</p>

In many of the spontaneous case reports of adverse behavioral effects, patients were receiving other CNS drugs concomitantly and/or were described as having underlying psychiatric conditions. Should any of the above events occur, alprazolam should be discontinued. Isolated published reports involving small numbers of patients have suggested that patients who have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434626" conceptname="Borderline personality disorder">borderline personality disorder</span>, a prior history of violent or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021344" conceptname="Abusive behavior">aggressive behavior</span>, or alcohol or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4279309" conceptname="Substance abuse">substance abuse</span> may be at risk for such events.

<h2>Post Introduction Reports</h2>
<p class="First">Various adverse drug reactions have been reported in association with the use of alprazolam since market introduction. The majority of these reactions were reported through the medical event voluntary reporting system. Because of the spontaneous nature of the reporting of medical events and the lack of controls, a causal relationship to the use of alprazolam cannot be readily determined.

<h2>Physical and Psychological <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">Dependence</span></h2>
<p class="First">Withdrawal symptoms similar in character to those noted with sedative/hypnotics and alcohol have occurred following discontinuance of benzodiazepines, including alprazolam. The symptoms can range from mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4148767" conceptname="Dysphoric mood">dysphoria</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> to a major syndrome that may include abdominal and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75635" conceptname="Cramp">muscle cramps</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremors</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>. Distinguishing between withdrawal emergent signs and symptoms and the recurrence of illness is often difficult in patients undergoing dose reduction. The long term strategy for treatment of these phenomena will vary with their cause and the therapeutic goal. When necessary, immediate management of withdrawal symptoms requires re-institution of treatment at doses of alprazolam sufficient to suppress symptoms. There have been reports of failure of other benzodiazepines to fully suppress these withdrawal symptoms. These failures have been attributed to incomplete cross-tolerance but may also reflect the use of an inadequate dosing regimen of the substituted benzodiazepine or the effects of concomitant medications.</p>
<p>While it is difficult to distinguish withdrawal and recurrence for certain patients, the time course and the nature of the symptoms may be helpful. A withdrawal syndrome typically includes the occurrence of new symptoms, tends to appear toward the end of taper or shortly after discontinuation, and will decrease with time. In recurring <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span>, symptoms similar to those observed before treatment may recur either early or late, and they will persist.</p>
<p>While the severity and incidence of withdrawal phenomena appear to be related to dose and duration of treatment, withdrawal symptoms, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>, have been reported after only brief therapy with alprazolam at doses within the recommended range for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> (e.g., 0.75 to 4 mg/day). Signs and symptoms of withdrawal are often more prominent after rapid decrease of dosage or abrupt discontinuance. The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218977" conceptname="Drug withdrawal seizure">withdrawal seizures</span> may be increased at doses above 4 mg/day (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_warnings_ID_ADD132A3-C934-41A5-BE7F-BF830C01321F">WARNINGS</a></span>).</p>
<p>Patients, especially individuals with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>, should not be abruptly discontinued from any CNS depressant agent, including alprazolam. It is recommended that all patients on alprazolam who require a dosage reduction be gradually tapered under close supervision (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_warnings_ID_ADD132A3-C934-41A5-BE7F-BF830C01321F">WARNINGS</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_ID_6E11A07E-069E-4F8F-A823-F12A3594C7C6">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>
<p>Psychological <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> is a risk with all benzodiazepines, including alprazolam. The risk of psychological <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> may also be increased at doses greater than 4 mg/day and with longer term use, and this risk is further increased in patients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse. Some patients have experienced considerable difficulty in tapering and discontinuing from alprazolam, especially those receiving higher doses for extended periods. Addiction-prone individuals should be under careful surveillance when receiving alprazolam. As with all anxiolytics, repeat prescriptions should be limited to those who are under medical supervision.</p>

<p class="First">Manifestations of alprazolam overdosage include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, impaired coordination, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4044603" conceptname="Hyporeflexia">diminished reflexes</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Death</span> has been reported in association with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> of alprazolam by itself, as it has with other benzodiazepines. In addition, fatalities have been reported in patients who have overdosed with a combination of a single benzodiazepine, including alprazolam, and alcohol; alcohol levels seen in some of these patients have been lower than those usually associated with alcohol-induced fatality.</p>
<p>The acute oral LD<span class="Sub">50</span> in rats is 331 to 2171 mg/kg. Other experiments in animals have indicated that cardiopulmonary collapse can occur following massive intravenous doses of alprazolam (over 195 mg/kg; 975 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of 10 mg/day). Animals could be resuscitated with positive mechanical ventilation and the intravenous infusion of norepinephrine bitartrate.</p>
<p>Animal experiments have suggested that forced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span> or hemodialysis are probably of little value in treating overdosage.</p>

<h2>General Treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">Overdose</span></h2>
<p class="First">Overdosage reports with alprazolam tablets are limited. As in all cases of drug overdosage, respiration, pulse rate, and blood pressure should be monitored. General supportive measures should be employed, along with immediate gastric lavage. Intravenous fluids should be administered and an adequate airway maintained. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> occurs, it may be combated by the use of vasopressors. Dialysis is of limited value. As with the management of intentional overdosing with any drug, it should be borne in mind that multiple agents may have been ingested.</p>
<p>Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, is indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines and may be used in situations when an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> with a benzodiazepine is known or suspected. Prior to the administration of flumazenil, necessary measures should be instituted to secure airway, ventilation, and intravenous access. Flumazenil is intended as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, proper management of benzodiazepine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. Patients treated with flumazenil should be monitored for re-sedation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, and other residual benzodiazepine effects for an appropriate period after treatment. <span class="Bold">The prescriber should be aware of a risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> in association with flumazenil treatment, particularly in long-term benzodiazepine users and in cyclic antidepressant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>.</span> The complete flumazenil package insert including <a href="#i4i_contraindications_ID_BC249000-1F22-42E0-A7D5-151D946F688A">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>, <a href="#i4i_warnings_ID_ADD132A3-C934-41A5-BE7F-BF830C01321F">WARNINGS</a>, and <a href="#i4i_precautions_ID_4B2F0E73-1B34-40E7-8652-63344984C4DD">PRECAUTIONS</a> should be consulted prior to use.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Dosage should be individualized for maximum beneficial effect. While the usual daily dosages given below will meet the needs of most patients, there will be some who require doses greater than 4 mg/day. In such cases, dosage should be increased cautiously to avoid adverse effects.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">

<p class="First">Treatment for patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> should be initiated with a dose of 0.25 to 0.5 mg given three times daily. The dose may be increased to achieve a maximum therapeutic effect, at intervals of 3 to 4 days, to a maximum daily dose of 4 mg, given in divided doses. The lowest possible effective dose should be employed and the need for continued treatment reassessed frequently. The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> may increase with dose and duration of treatment.</p>
<p>In all patients, dosage should be reduced gradually when discontinuing therapy or when decreasing the daily dosage. Although there are no systematically collected data to support a specific discontinuation schedule, it is suggested that the daily dosage be decreased by no more than 0.5 mg every three days. Some patients may require an even slower dosage reduction.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">Panic Disorder</span></h2>
<p class="First">The successful treatment of many <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> patients has required the use of alprazolam at doses greater than 4 mg daily. In controlled trials conducted to establish the efficacy of alprazolam in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span>, doses in the range of 1 to 10 mg daily were used. The mean dosage employed was approximately 5 to 6 mg daily. Among the approximately 1700 patients participating in the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> development program, about 300 received alprazolam in dosages of greater than 7 mg/day, including approximately 100 patients who received maximum dosages of greater than 9 mg/day. Occasional patients required as much as 10 mg a day to achieve a successful response.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="i4i_section_ID_C1669B28-39BC-4D15-8FFD-CA6BDFE0F404"></a><a name="section-11.2.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Dose Titration</h3>
<p class="First">Treatment may be initiated with a dose of 0.5 mg three times daily. Depending on the response, the dose may be increased at intervals of 3 to 4 days in increments of no more than 1 mg per day. Slower titration to the dose levels greater than 4 mg/day may be advisable to allow full expression of the pharmacodynamic effect of alprazolam. To lessen the possibility of interdose symptoms, the times of administration should be distributed as evenly as possible throughout the waking hours, that is, on a three or four times per day schedule.</p>
<p>Generally, therapy should be initiated at a low dose to minimize the risk of adverse responses in patients especially sensitive to the drug. Dose should be advanced until an acceptable therapeutic response (ie, a substantial reduction in or total elimination of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021498" conceptname="Panic attack">panic attacks</span>) is achieved, intolerance occurs, or the maximum recommended dose is attained.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="i4i_section_ID_5F0889B8-D4F6-4812-A9D9-7D56B06CAD70"></a><a name="section-11.2.2"></a><p></p>
<h3>Dose Maintenance</h3>
<p class="First">For patients receiving doses greater than 4 mg/day, periodic reassessment and consideration of dosage reduction is advised. In a controlled postmarketing dose-response study, patients treated with doses of alprazolam greater than 4 mg/day for 3 months were able to taper to 50% of their total maintenance dose without apparent loss of clinical benefit. Because of the danger of withdrawal, abrupt discontinuation of treatment should be avoided. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_warnings_ID_ADD132A3-C934-41A5-BE7F-BF830C01321F">WARNINGS</a>, <a href="#i4i_precautions_ID_4B2F0E73-1B34-40E7-8652-63344984C4DD">PRECAUTIONS</a>, <a href="#i4i_abuse_dependence_ID_46EF1F27-3AF7-4566-BE26-55A2F246690D">DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></a></span>.)</p>
<p>The necessary duration of treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> patients responding to alprazolam is unknown. After a period of extended freedom from attacks, a carefully supervised tapered discontinuation may be attempted, but there is evidence that this may often be difficult to accomplish without recurrence of symptoms and/or the manifestation of withdrawal phenomena.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="i4i_section_ID_F6A77F54-B846-4392-A828-F2DC52010ED2"></a><a name="section-11.2.3"></a><p></p>
<h3>Dose Reduction</h3>
<p class="First">Because of the danger of withdrawal, abrupt discontinuation of treatment should be avoided (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_warnings_ID_ADD132A3-C934-41A5-BE7F-BF830C01321F">WARNINGS</a>, <a href="#i4i_precautions_ID_4B2F0E73-1B34-40E7-8652-63344984C4DD">PRECAUTIONS</a>, <a href="#i4i_abuse_dependence_ID_46EF1F27-3AF7-4566-BE26-55A2F246690D">DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></a></span>).</p>
<p>In all patients, dosage should be reduced gradually when discontinuing therapy or when decreasing the daily dosage. Although there are no systematically collected data to support a specific discontinuation schedule, it is suggested that the daily dosage be decreased by no more than 0.5 mg every three days. Some patients may require an even slower dosage reduction.</p>
<p>In any case, reduction of dose must be undertaken under close supervision and must be gradual. If significant withdrawal symptoms develop, the previous dosing schedule should be reinstituted and, only after stabilization, should a less rapid schedule of discontinuation be attempted. In a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> patients which compared this recommended taper schedule with a slower taper schedule, no difference was observed between the groups in the proportion of patients who tapered to zero dose; however, the slower schedule was associated with a reduction in symptoms associated with a withdrawal syndrome. It is suggested that the dose be reduced by no more than 0.5 mg every 3 days, with the understanding that some patients may benefit from an even more gradual discontinuation. Some patients may prove resistant to all discontinuation regimens.</p>

<h2>Dosing in Special Populations</h2>
<p class="First">In elderly patients, in patients with advanced liver disease or in patients with debilitating disease, the usual starting dose is 0.25 mg, given two or three times daily. This may be gradually increased if needed and tolerated. The elderly may be especially sensitive to the effects of benzodiazepines. If side effects occur at the recommended starting dose, the dose may be lowered.</p>
