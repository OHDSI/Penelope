DESCRIPTION
</h1>
<p class="First">CIPRODEX® (ciprofloxacin 0.3% and dexamethasone 0.1%) Sterile Otic Suspension contains the synthetic broad-spectrum antibacterial agent, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, combined with the anti-inflammatory corticosteroid, dexamethasone, in a sterile, preserved suspension for otic use. Each mL of CIPRODEX® Otic contains ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (equivalent to 3 mg ciprofloxacin base), 1 mg dexamethasone, and 0.1 mg benzalkonium chloride as a preservative. The inactive ingredients are boric acid, sodium chloride, hydroxyethyl cellulose, tyloxapol, acetic acid, sodium acetate, edetate disodium, and purified water. Sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid may be added for adjustment of pH.</p>
<p>Ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone is available as the monohydrochloride monohydrate salt of 1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-(1-piperazinyl)-3-qui nolinecarboxylic acid.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics: </span>Following a single bilateral 4-drop (total dose = 0.28 mL, 0.84 mg ciprofloxacin, 0.28 mg dexamethasone) topical otic dose of CIPRODEX® Otic to pediatric patients after tympanostomy tube insertion, measurable plasma concentrations of ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone were observed at 6 hours following administration in 2 of 9 patients and 5 of 9 patients, respectively.</p>
<p>Mean ± SD peak plasma concentrations of ciprofloxacin were 1.39 ± 0.880 ng/mL (n=9). Peak plasma concentrations ranged from 0.543 ng/mL to 3.45 ng/mL and were on average approximately 0.1% of peak plasma concentrations achieved with an oral dose of 250-mg [1]. Peak plasma concentrations of ciprofloxacin were observed within 15 minutes to 2 hours post dose application.</p>
<p>Mean ± SD peak plasma concentrations of dexamethasone were 1.14 ± 1.54 ng/mL (n=9). Peak plasma concentrations ranged from 0.135 ng/mL to 5.10 ng/mL and were on average approximately 14% of peak concentrations reported in the literature following an oral 0.5-mg tablet dose[2]. Peak plasma concentrations of dexamethasone were observed within 15 minutes to 2 hours post dose application.</p>
<p>Dexamethasone has been added to aid in the resolution of the inflammatory response accompanying <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432545" conceptname="Bacterial infectious disease">bacterial infection</span> (such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378160" conceptname="Otorrhea">otorrhea</span> in pediatric patients with AOM with tympanostomy tubes).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Microbiology: </span>Ciprofloxacin has <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.  The bactericidal action of ciprofloxacin results from interference with the enzyme, DNA gyrase, which is needed for the synthesis of bacterial DNA. Cross-resistance has been observed between ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones. There is generally no cross-resistance between ciprofloxacin and other classes of antibacterial agents such as beta-lactams or aminoglycosides.  </p>
<p>Ciprofloxacin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>and clinically in otic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> as described in the <span class="Bold Underline"><a href="#splSectionIndicationsUsage">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</a></span> section.</p>

<h2>
General:
</h2>
<p class="First">As with other antibacterial preparations, use of this product may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including yeast and fungi. If the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> is not improved after one week of treatment, cultures should be obtained to guide further treatment. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378160" conceptname="Otorrhea">otorrhea</span> persists after a full course of therapy, or if two or more episodes of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378160" conceptname="Otorrhea">otorrhea</span> occur within six months, further evaluation is recommended to exclude an underlying condition such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372925" conceptname="Cholesteatoma">cholesteatoma</span>, foreign body, or a tumor.</p>
<p>The systemic administration of quinolones, including ciprofloxacin at doses much higher than given or absorbed by the otic route, has led to lesions or erosions of the cartilage in weight-bearing joints and other signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="73553" conceptname="Arthropathy">arthropathy</span> in immature animals of various species.</p>
<p>Guinea pigs dosed in the middle ear with CIPRODEX® Otic for one month exhibited no drug-related structural or functional changes of the cochlear hair cells and no lesions in the ossicles. CIPRODEX® Otic was also shown to lack dermal sensitizing potential in the guinea pig when tested according to the method of Buehler.</p>
<p>No signs of local irritation were found when CIPRODEX® Otic was applied topically in the rabbit eye.</p>

Drug Interactions
</h2>
<p class="First">Specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with CIPRODEX® Otic.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34083-6">
<a name="splSectionPrecautionsCarcinogen"></a><a name="section-6.3.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
</h3>
<p class="First">Long-term carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats have been completed for ciprofloxacin. After daily oral doses of 750 mg/kg (mice) and 250 mg/kg (rats) were administered for up to 2 years, there was no evidence that ciprofloxacin had any carcinogenic or tumorigenic effects in these species. No long term studies of CIPRODEX® Otic have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential.</p>
<p>Eight <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>mutagenicity tests have been conducted with ciprofloxacin, and the test results are listed below:</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span></span>/Microsome Test (Negative)</p>
<p><span class="Italics">E. coli </span>DNA Repair Assay (Negative)</p>
<p>Mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">Lymphoma</span> Cell Forward Mutation</p>
<p>Assay (Positive)</p>
<p>Chinese Hamster V79 Cell HGPRT Test (Negative)</p>
<p>Syrian Hamster Embryo Cell Transformation</p>
<p>Assay (Negative)</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Saccharomyces cerevisiae </span>Point Mutation</p>
<p>Assay (Negative)</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Saccharomyces cerevisiae </span>Mitotic Crossover and Gene</p>
<p>Conversion Assay (Negative)</p>
<p>Rat Hepatocyte DNA Repair Assay (Positive)</p>
<p>Thus, 2 of the 8 tests were positive, but results of the following 3 <span class="Italics">in vivo </span>test systems gave negative results:</p>
<p>Rat Hepatocyte DNA Repair Assay</p>
<p>Micronucleus Test (Mice)</p>
<p>Dominant Lethal Test (Mice)</p>
<p>Fertility studies performed in rats at oral doses of ciprofloxacin up to 100 mg/kg/day revealed no evidence of impairment. This would be over 100 times the maximum recommended clinical dose of ototopical ciprofloxacin based upon body surface area, assuming total absorption of ciprofloxacin from the ear of a patient treated with CIPRODEX® Otic twice per day according to label directions.</p>
<p>Long term studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of topical otic dexamethasone.  Dexamethasone has been tested for <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>and <span class="Italics">in vivo </span>genotoxic potential and shown to be positive in the following assays; chromosomal aberrations, sister-chromatid exchange in human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span> and micronuclei and sister-chromatid exchanges in mouse bone marrow. However, the Ames/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span> assay, both with and without S9 mix, did not show any increase in His+ revertants. </p>
<p>The effect of dexamethasone on fertility has not been investigated following topical otic application. However, the lowest toxic dose of dexamethasone identified following topical dermal application was 1.802 mg/kg in a 26-week study in male rats and resulted in changes to the testes, epididymis, sperm duct, prostate, seminal vessicle, Cowper's gland and accessory glands. The relevance of this study for short term topical otic use is unknown.</p>

<p class="First">Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and mice using oral doses of up to 100 mg/kg and IV doses up to 30 mg/kg and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus as a result of ciprofloxacin. In rabbits, ciprofloxacin (30 and 100 mg/kg orally) produced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302537" conceptname="Digestive system finding">gastrointestinal disturbances</span> resulting in maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> and an increased incidence of abortion, but no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> was observed at either dose.

<p>Corticosteroids are generally teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels.  The more potent corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals.</p>
<p>Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with CIPRODEX® Otic. No adequate and well controlled studies have been performed in pregnant women. Caution should be exercised when CIPRODEX® Otic is used by a pregnant woman.</p>

<h2>
Nursing Mothers:
</h2>
<p class="First">Ciprofloxacin and corticosteroids, as a class, appear in milk following oral administration. Dexamethasone in breast milk could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical otic administration of ciprofloxacin or dexamethasone could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because of the potential for unwanted effects in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<p>(ciprofloxacin 0.3% and dexamethasone 0.1%)</p>
<p>Sterile Otic Suspension</p>
<p><span class="Bold">IMPORTANT PATIENT INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS. READ BEFORE USE.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">What is CIPRODEX® Otic?</span></p>
<p>CIPRODEX® Otic is an antibiotic/steroid combination product in a sterile suspension used to treat:</p>
<p>• <span class="Bold">Middle <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4044878" conceptname="Infection of ear">Ear Infection</span> with Drainage Through a Tube in Children 6 months and older: </span>A middle <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4044878" conceptname="Infection of ear">ear infection</span> is a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432545" conceptname="Bacterial infectious disease">bacterial infection</span> behind the eardrum.  People with a tube in the eardrum may notice drainage from the ear canal.\</p>
<p>• <span class="Bold">Outer Ear Canal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">Infection</span> in Patients 6 months and older: </span>An outer ear canal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, also known as "Swimmer's Ear", is a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432545" conceptname="Bacterial infectious disease">bacterial infection</span> of the outer ear canal. The ear canal and the outer part of the ear may swell, turn red, and be painful. Also, a fluid discharge may appear in the ear canal.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Who should NOT use CIPRODEX® Otic?</span></p>
<p>• Do not use this product if allergic to ciprofloxacin or to other quinolone antibiotics.</p>
<p>• Do not use this product if allergic to dexamethasone or to other steroids.</p>
<p>• Do not give this product to pediatric patients who are less than 6 months old.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">How often should CIPRODEX® Otic be given?</span></p>
<p>CIPRODEX® Otic ear drops should be given 2 times each day (about 12 hours apart, for example, 8 AM and 8 PM) in each infected ear unless the doctor has instructed otherwise. The best times to use the ear drops are in the morning and at night. It is very important to use the ear drops for as long as the doctor has instructed, <span class="Bold">even if the symptoms improve</span>. If CIPRODEX® Otic ear drops are not used for as long as the doctor has instructed, the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> may return.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What if a dose is missed?</span></p>
<p>If a dose of CIPRODEX® Otic is missed, it should be given as soon as possible. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to the regular dosing schedule. Do not use a double dose unless the doctor has instructed you to do so. If the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> is not improved after one week, you should consult your doctor. If you have two or more episodes of drainage within six months, it is recommended you see your doctor for further evaluation.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What activities should be avoided while using CIPRODEX® Otic?</span></p>
<p>It is important that the infected ear(s) remain clean and dry. When bathing, avoid getting the infected ear(s) wet. Avoid swimming unless the doctor has instructed otherwise.</p>
