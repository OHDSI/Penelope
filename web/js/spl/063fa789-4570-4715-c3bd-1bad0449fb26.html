<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">NOLVADEX® (tamoxifen citrate) Tablets, a nonsteroidal antiestrogen, are for oral administration.  NOLVADEX Tablets are available as:</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="">
<a name="section-2.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>10 mg Tablets:</h2>
<p class="First">Each tablet contains 15.2 mg of tamoxifen citrate which is equivalent to 10 mg of tamoxifen.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="">
<a name="section-2.2"></a><p></p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">NOLVADEX is a nonsteroidal agent that has demonstrated potent antiestrogenic properties in animal test systems.  The antiestrogenic effects may be related to its ability to compete with estrogen for binding sites in target tissues such as breast.  Tamoxifen inhibits the induction of rat mammary carcinoma induced by dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) and causes the regression of already established DMBA-induced tumors.  In this rat model, tamoxifen appears to exert its antitumor effects by binding the estrogen receptors.</p>
<p>In cytosols derived from human breast adenocarcinomas, tamoxifen competes with estradiol for estrogen receptor protein.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="">
<a name="section-3.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Absorption and Distribution:</h2>
<p class="First">Following a single oral dose of 20 mg tamoxifen, an average peak plasma concentration of 40 ng/mL (range 35 to 45 ng/mL) occurred approximately 5 hours after dosing.  The decline in plasma concentrations of tamoxifen is biphasic with a terminal elimination half-life of about 5 to 7 days.  The average peak plasma concentration of N-desmethyl tamoxifen is 15 ng/mL (range 10 to 20 ng/mL).  Chronic administration of 10 mg tamoxifen given twice daily for 3 months to patients results in average steady-state plasma concentrations of 120 ng/mL (range 67-183 ng/mL) for tamoxifen and 336 ng/mL (range 148-654 ng/mL) for N-desmethyl tamoxifen.  The average steady-state plasma concentrations of tamoxifen and N-desmethyl tamoxifen after administration of 20 mg tamoxifen once daily for 3 months are 122 ng/mL (range 71-183 ng/mL) and 353 ng/mL (range 152-706 ng/mL), respectively.  After initiation of therapy, steady state concentrations for tamoxifen are achieved in about 4 weeks and steady-state concentrations for N-desmethyl tamoxifen are achieved in about 8 weeks, suggesting a half-life of approximately 14 days for this metabolite. In a steady-state, crossover study of 10 mg NOLVADEX tablets given twice a day vs. a 20 mg NOLVADEX tablet given once daily, the 20 mg NOLVADEX tablet was bioequivalent to the 10 mg NOLVADEX tablets.</p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="">
<a name="section-3.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Metabolism:</h2>
<p class="First">Tamoxifen is extensively metabolized after oral administration. N-desmethyl tamoxifen is the major metabolite found in patients' plasma.  The biological activity of N-desmethyl tamoxifen appears to be similar to that of tamoxifen.  4-Hydroxytamoxifen and a side chain primary alcohol derivative of tamoxifen have been identified as minor metabolites in plasma.  Tamoxifen is a substrate of cytochrome P-450 3A, 2C9 and 2D6, and an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="">
<a name="section-3.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Excretion:</h2>
<p class="First">Studies in women receiving 20 mg of <span class="Sup">14</span>C tamoxifen have shown that approximately 65% of the administered dose was excreted from the body over a period of 2 weeks with fecal excretion as the primary route of elimination.  The drug is excreted mainly as polar conjugates, with unchanged drug and unconjugated metabolites accounting for less than 30% of the total fecal radioactivity.</p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="">
<a name="section-3.4"></a><p></p>
<h2>Special Populations:</h2>
<p class="First">The effects of age, gender and race on the pharmacokinetics of tamoxifen have not been determined.  The effects of reduced liver function on the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of tamoxifen have not been determined.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="">
<a name="section-3.4.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Pediatric Patients:</h3>
<p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of tamoxifen and N-desmethyl tamoxifen were characterized using a population pharmacokinetic analysis with sparse samples per patient obtained from 27 female pediatric patients aged 2 to 10 years enrolled in a study designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of NOLVADEX in treating McCune-Albright Syndrome.  Rich data from two tamoxifen citrate pharmacokinetic trials in which 59 postmenopausal women with breast cancer completed the studies were included in the analysis to determine the structural pharmacokinetic model for tamoxifen.  A one-compartment model provided the best fit to the data.</p>
<p>In pediatric patients, an average steady state peak plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">ss</span>, <span class="Sub">max</span>) and AUC were of 187 ng/mL and 4110 ng hr/mL, respectively, and C<span class="Sub">ss</span>, <span class="Sub">max</span> occurred approximately 8 hours after dosing.  Clearance (CL/F) as body weight adjusted in female pediatric patients was approximately 2.3-fold higher than in female breast cancer patients.  In the youngest cohort of female pediatric patients (2-6 year olds), CL/F was 2.6-fold higher; in the oldest cohort (7-10.9 year olds) CL/F was approximately 1.9-fold higher.  Exposure to N-desmethyl tamoxifen was comparable between the pediatric and adult patients. <span class="Bold">The safety and efficacy of NOLVADEX for girls aged two to 10 years with McCune-Albright Syndrome and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4267558" conceptname="Precocious puberty">precocious puberty</span> have not been studied beyond one year of treatment.  The long-term effects of NOLVADEX therapy in girls have not been established.</span>  In adults treated with NOLVADEX an increase in incidence of uterine malignancies, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440417" conceptname="Pulmonary embolism">pulmonary embolism</span> has been noted (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#wherry1138991318763">BOXED WARNING</a></span>).</p>

<h3>Drug-Drug Interactions:</h3>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies showed that erythromycin, cyclosporin, nifedipine and diltiazem competitively inhibited formation of N-desmethyl tamoxifen with apparent K<span class="Sub">1</span> of 20, 1, 45 and 30 µM, respectively. The clinical significance of these <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies is unknown.</p>
<p>Tamoxifen reduced the plasma concentration of letrozole by 37% when these drugs were co-administered.  Rifampin, a cytochrome P-450 3A4 inducer reduced tamoxifen AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 86% and 55%, respectively.  Aminoglutethimide reduces tamoxifen and N-desmethyl tamoxifen plasma concentrations. Medroxyprogesterone reduces plasma concentrations of N-desmethyl, but not tamoxifen.  </p>
<p>In the anastrozole adjuvant trial, co-administration of anastrozole and NOLVADEX in breast cancer patients reduced anastrozole plasma concentration by 27% compared to those achieved with anastrozole alone; however, the coadministration did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tamoxifen or N-desmethyltamoxifen (see <a href="#rowellsl1141320611725">PRECAUTIONS -Drug Interactions</a>).  NOLVADEX should not be co-administered with anastrozole.</p>

<h3>Metastatic Breast Cancer:</h3>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="">
<a name="section-3.5.1.1"></a><p></p>
<h4>Premenopausal Women (NOLVADEX vs. Ablation):</h4>
<p class="First">Three prospective, randomized studies (Ingle, Pritchard, Buchanan) compared NOLVADEX to ovarian ablation (oophorectomy or ovarian irradiation) in premenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.  Although the objective response rate, time to treatment failure, and survival were similar with both treatments, the limited patient accrual prevented a demonstration of equivalence.  In an overview analysis of survival data from the 3 studies, the hazard ratio for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> (NOLVADEX/ovarian ablation) was 1.00 with two-sided 95% confidence intervals of 0.73 to 1.37.  Elevated serum and plasma estrogens have been observed in premenopausal women receiving NOLVADEX, but the data from the randomized studies do not suggest an adverse effect of this increase.  A limited number of premenopausal patients with disease progression during NOLVADEX therapy responded to subsequent ovarian ablation.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="">
<a name="section-3.5.1.2"></a><p></p>
<h4>Male Breast Cancer:</h4>
<p class="First">Published results from 122 patients (119 evaluable) and case reports in 16 patients (13 evaluable) treated with NOLVADEX have shown that NOLVADEX is effective for the palliative treatment of male breast cancer.  Sixty-six of these 132 evaluable patients responded to NOLVADEX which constitutes a 50% objective response rate.</p>

<h3>Adjuvant Breast Cancer:</h3>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="">
<a name="section-3.5.2.1"></a><p></p>
<h4>Overview:</h4>
<p class="First">The Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) conducted worldwide overviews of systemic adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer in 1985, 1990, and again in 1995.  In 1998, 10-year outcome data were reported for 36,689 women in 55 randomized trials of adjuvant NOLVADEX using doses of 20-40 mg/day for 1-5+ years.  Twenty-five percent of patients received 1 year or less of trial treatment, 52% received 2 years, and 23% received about 5 years.  Forty-eight percent of tumors were estrogen receptor (ER) positive (&gt; 10 fmol/mg), 21% were ER poor (&lt; 10 fmol/l), and 31% were ER unknown. Among 29,441 patients with ER positive or unknown breast cancer, 58% were entered into trials comparing NOLVADEX to no adjuvant therapy and 42% were entered into trials comparing NOLVADEX in combination with chemotherapy vs. the same chemotherapy alone. Among these patients, 54% had node positive disease and 46% had node negative disease.</p>
<p>Among women with ER positive or unknown breast cancer and positive nodes who received about 5 years of treatment, overall survival at 10 years was 61.4% for NOLVADEX vs. 50.5% for control (logrank 2p &lt; 0.00001). The recurrence-free rate at 10 years was 59.7% for NOLVADEX vs. 44.5% for control (logrank 2p &lt; 0.00001). Among women with ER positive or unknown breast cancer and negative nodes who received about 5 years of treatment, overall survival at 10 years was 78.9% for NOLVADEX vs. 73.3% for control (logrank 2p &lt; 0.00001). The recurrence-free rate at 10 years was 79.2% for NOLVADEX versus 64.3% for control (logrank 2p &lt; 0.00001). </p>
<p>The effect of the scheduled duration of tamoxifen may be described as follows. In women with ER positive or unknown breast cancer receiving 1 year or less, 2 years or about 5 years of NOLVADEX, the proportional reductions in mortality were 12%, 17% and 26%, respectively (trend significant at 2p &lt; 0.003). The corresponding reductions in breast cancer recurrence were 21%, 29% and 47%  (trend significant at 2p &lt; 0.00001).</p>
<p>Benefit is less clear for women with ER poor breast cancer in whom the proportional reduction in recurrence was 10% (2p = 0.007) for all durations taken together, or 9% (2p = 0.02) if contralateral breast cancers are excluded.  The corresponding reduction in mortality was 6% (NS). The effects of about 5 years of NOLVADEX on recurrence and mortality were similar regardless of age and concurrent chemotherapy.  There was no indication that doses greater than 20 mg per day were more effective.</p>

<h4>Anastrozole Adjuvant ATAC Trial Study of Anastrozole compared to NOLVADEX for Adjuvant Treatment of Early Breast Cancer:</h4>
<p class="First">An anastrozole adjuvant trial was conducted in 9366 postmenopausal women with operable breast cancer who were randomized to receive adjuvant treatment with either anastrozole 1 mg daily, NOLVADEX 20 mg daily, or a combination of these two treatments for five years or until recurrence of the disease. At a median follow-up of 33 months, the combination of anastrozole and NOLVADEX did not demonstrate any efficacy benefit when compared with NOLVADEX therapy alone, in all patients as well as in the hormone receptor-positive subpopulation. This treatment arm was discontinued from the trial.  Please refer to <a href="#rowellsl1141320962799">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY-Special Populations-Drug-Drug Interactions</a>, <a href="#rowellsl1141320994517">PRECAUTIONS-Laboratory Tests</a>, <a href="#rowellsl1141320611725">PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions</a> and <a href="#rowellsl1141321031048">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a> sections for safety information from this trial.  Please refer to the full prescribing information for ARIMIDEX® (anastrozole) 1 mg Tablets for additional information on this trial.  </p>
<p>Patients in the two monotherapy arms of the ATAC trial were treated for a median of 60 months (5 years) and followed for a median of 68 months.  Disease-free survival in the intent-to-treat population was statistically significantly improved [Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.97, p=0.0127] in the anatrozole arm compared to the NOLVADEX arm.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="">
<a name="section-3.5.2.3"></a><p></p>
<h4>Node Positive - Individual Studies:</h4>
<p class="First">Two studies (Hubay and NSABP B-09) demonstrated an improved disease-free survival following radical or modified radical mastectomy in postmenopausal women or women 50 years of age or older with surgically curable breast cancer with positive axillary nodes when NOLVADEX was added to adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy.  In the Hubay study, NOLVADEX was added to "low-dose" CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil).  In the NSABP B-09 study, NOLVADEX was added to melphalan [L-phenylalanine mustard (P)] and fluorouracil (F).</p>
<p>In the Hubay study, patients with a positive (more than 3 fmol) estrogen receptor were more likely to benefit.  In the NSABP B-09 study in women age 50-59 years, only women with both estrogen and progesterone receptor levels 10 fmol or greater clearly benefited, while there was a nonstatistically significant trend toward adverse effect in women with both estrogen and progesterone receptor levels less than 10 fmol.  In women age 60-70 years, there was a trend toward a beneficial effect of NOLVADEX without any clear relationship to estrogen or progesterone receptor status. </p>
<p>Three prospective studies (ECOG-1178, Toronto, NATO) using NOLVADEX adjuvantly as a single agent demonstrated an improved disease-free survival following total mastectomy and axillary dissection for postmenopausal women with positive axillary nodes compared to placebo/no treatment controls.  The NATO study also demonstrated an overall survival benefit.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="">
<a name="section-3.5.2.4"></a><p></p>
<h4>Node Negative - Individual Studies:</h4>
<p class="First">NSABP B-14, a prospective, double-blind, randomized study, compared NOLVADEX to placebo in women with axillary node-negative, estrogen-receptor positive (≥10 fmol/mg cytosol protein) breast cancer (as adjuvant therapy, following total mastectomy and axillary dissection, or segmental resection, axillary dissection, and breast radiation).  After five years of treatment, there was a significant improvement in disease-free survival in women receiving NOLVADEX.  This benefit was apparent both in women under age 50 and in women at or beyond age 50.  </p>
<p>One additional randomized study (NATO) demonstrated improved disease-free survival for NOLVADEX compared to no adjuvant therapy following total mastectomy and axillary dissection in postmenopausal women with axillary node-negative breast cancer.  In this study, the benefits of NOLVADEX appeared to be independent of estrogen receptor status.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="">
<a name="section-3.5.2.5"></a><p></p>
<h4>Duration of Therapy:</h4>
<p class="First">In the EBCTCG 1995 overview, the reduction in recurrence and mortality was greater in those studies that used tamoxifen for about 5 years than in those that used tamoxifen for a shorter period of therapy.</p>
<p>In the NSABP B-14 trial, in which patients were randomized to NOLVADEX 20 mg/day for 5 years vs. placebo and were disease-free at the end of this 5-year period were offered rerandomization to an additional 5 years of NOLVADEX or placebo. With 4 years of follow-up after this rerandomization, 92% of the women that received 5 years of NOLVADEX were alive and disease-free, compared to 86% of the women scheduled to receive 10 years of NOLVADEX (p=0.003). Overall survivals were 96% and 94%, respectively (p=0.08).  Results of the B-14 study suggest that continuation of therapy beyond 5 years does not provide additional benefit. </p>
<p>A Scottish trial of 5 years of tamoxifen vs. indefinite treatment found a disease-free survival of 70% in the five-year group  and 61% in the indefinite group, with 6.2 years median follow-up (HR=1.27, 95% CI 0.87-1.85).</p>
<p>In a large randomized trial conducted by the Swedish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group of adjuvant NOLVADEX 40 mg/day for 2 or 5 years, overall survival at 10 years was estimated to be 80% in the patients in the 5-year tamoxifen group, compared with 74% among corresponding patients in the 2-year treatment group (p=0.03).  Disease-free survival at 10 years was 73% in the 5-year group and 67% in the 2-year group (p=0.009). Compared with 2 years of tamoxifen treatment, 5 years of treatment resulted in a slightly greater reduction in the incidence of contralateral breast cancer at 10 years, but this difference was not statistically significant.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="">
<a name="section-3.5.2.6"></a><p></p>
<h4>Contralateral Breast Cancer:</h4>
<p class="First">The incidence of contralateral breast cancer is reduced in breast cancer patients (premenopausal and postmenopausal) receiving NOLVADEX compared to placebo.  Data on contralateral breast cancer are available from 32,422 out of 36,689 patients in the 1995 overview analysis of the Early Breast Cancer Trialists Collaborative Group (EBCTCG).  In clinical trials with NOLVADEX of 1 year or less, 2 years, and about 5 years duration, the proportional reductions in the incidence rate of contralateral breast cancer among women receiving NOLVADEX were 13% (NS), 26% (2p = 0.004) and 47% (2p &lt; 0.00001), with a significant trend favoring longer tamoxifen duration (2p = 0.008). The proportional reductions in the incidence of contralateral breast cancer were independent of age and ER status of the primary tumor. Treatment with about 5 years of NOLVADEX reduced the annual incidence rate of contralateral breast cancer from 7.6 per 1,000 patients in the control group compared with 3.9 per 1,000 patients in the tamoxifen group.</p>
<p>In a large randomized trial in Sweden (the Stockholm Trial) of adjuvant NOLVADEX 40 mg/day for 2-5 years, the incidence of second primary breast tumors was reduced 40% (p &lt; 0.008) on tamoxifen compared to control. In the NSABP B-14 trial in which patients were randomized to NOLVADEX 20 mg/day for 5 years vs. placebo, the incidence of second primary breast cancers was also significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.01). In NSABP B-14, the annual rate of contralateral breast cancer was 8.0 per 1000 patients in the placebo group compared with 5.0 per 1,000 patients in the tamoxifen group, at 10 years after first randomization.</p>

<h3><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4313969" conceptname="Intraductal carcinoma, noninfiltrating">Ductal Carcinoma in Situ</span>:</h3>
<p class="First">NSABP B-24, a double-blind, randomized trial included women with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4313969" conceptname="Intraductal carcinoma, noninfiltrating">ductal carcinoma in situ</span> (DCIS).  This trial compared the addition of NOLVADEX or placebo to treatment with lumpectomy and radiation therapy for women with DCIS.  The primary objective was to determine whether 5 years of NOLVADEX therapy (20 mg/day) would reduce the incidence of invasive breast cancer in the ipsilateral (the same) or contralateral (the opposite) breast. </p>
<p>In this trial 1,804 women were randomized to receive either NOLVADEX or placebo for 5 years: 902 women were randomized to NOLVADEX 10 mg tablets twice a day and 902 women were randomized to placebo.  As of December 31, 1998, follow-up data were available for 1,798 women and the median duration of follow-up was 74 months.</p>
<p>The NOLVADEX and placebo groups were well balanced for baseline demographic and prognostic factors. Over 80% of the tumors were less than or equal to 1 cm in their maximum dimension, were not palpable, and were detected by mammography alone.  Over 60% of the study population was postmenopausal.  In 16% of patients, the margin of the resected specimen was reported as being positive after surgery.  Approximately half of the tumors were reported to contain comedo <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280654" conceptname="Necrosis">necrosis</span>.</p>
<p>For the primary endpoint, the incidence of invasive breast cancer was reduced by 43% among women assigned to NOLVADEX (44 cases - NOLVADEX, 74 cases - placebo; p=0.004; relative risk (RR)=0.57, 95% CI: 0.39-0.84).  No data are available regarding the ER status of the invasive cancers.  The stage distribution of the invasive cancers at diagnosis was similar to that reported annually in the SEER data base.</p>
<p>Results are shown in Table 1.  For each endpoint the following results are presented: the number of events and rate per 1,000 women per year for the placebo and NOLVADEX groups; and the relative risk (RR) and its associated 95% confidence interval (CI) between NOLVADEX and placebo.  Relative risks less than 1.0 indicate a benefit of NOLVADEX therapy.  The limits of the confidence intervals can be used to assess the statistical significance of the benefits of NOLVADEX therapy.  If the upper limit of the CI is less than 1.0, then a statistically significant benefit exists.</p>

<h3>Reduction in Breast Cancer Incidence in High Risk Women:</h3>
<p class="First">The Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (BCPT, NSABP P-1) was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with a primary objective to determine whether 5 years of NOLVADEX therapy (20 mg/day) would reduce the incidence of invasive breast cancer in women at high risk for the disease  (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#wherry1138991398779">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</a></span>).  Secondary objectives included an evaluation of the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4124683" conceptname="Silent myocardial ischemia">ischemic heart disease</span>; the effects on the incidence of bone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">fractures</span>; and other events that might be associated with the use of NOLVADEX, including: endometrial cancer, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440417" conceptname="Pulmonary embolism">pulmonary embolus</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4042396" conceptname="Deep thrombophlebitis">deep vein thrombosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">cataract</span> formation and surgery (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#wherry1138991410042">WARNINGS</a></span>).</p>
<p>The Gail Model was used to calculate predicted breast cancer risk for women who were less than 60 years of age and did not have lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). The following risk factors were used: age; number of first-degree female relatives with breast cancer; previous breast biopsies; presence or absence of atypical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4296894" conceptname="Hyperplasia">hyperplasia</span>; nulliparity; age at first live birth; and age at <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4061459" conceptname="Menarche">menarche</span>. A 5-year predicted risk of breast cancer of ≥ 1.67% was required for entry into the trial.</p>
<p>In this trial, 13,388 women of at least 35 years of age were randomized to receive either NOLVADEX or placebo for five years. The median duration of treatment was 3.5 years.  As of January 31, 1998, follow-up data is available for 13,114 women.  Twenty-seven percent of women randomized to placebo (1,782) and 24% of women randomized to NOLVADEX (1,596) completed 5 years of therapy. The demographic characteristics of women on the trial with follow-up data are shown in Table 2.</p>

<p>Results are shown in Table 3.  After a median follow-up of 4.2 years, the incidence of invasive breast cancer was reduced by 44% among women assigned to NOLVADEX (86 cases-NOLVADEX, 156 cases-placebo; p&lt;0.00001; relative risk (RR)=0.56, 95% CI:  0.43-0.72).  A reduction in the incidence of breast cancer was seen in each prospectively specified age group  (≤ 49, 50-59, ≥ 60), in women with or without LCIS, and in each of the absolute risk levels specified in Table 3. A non-significant decrease in the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4313969" conceptname="Intraductal carcinoma, noninfiltrating">ductal carcinoma in situ</span> (DCIS) was seen (23-NOLVADEX, 35-placebo; RR=0.66; 95% CI: 0.39-1.11).</p>
<p>There was no statistically significant difference in the number of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarctions</span>, severe angina, or acute ischemic cardiac events between the two groups (61-NOLVADEX, 59-placebo; RR=1.04, 95% CI: 0.73-1.49).</p>
<p>No overall difference in mortality (53 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> in NOLVADEX group vs. 65 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> in placebo group) was present. No difference in breast cancer-related mortality was observed (4 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> in NOLVADEX group vs. 5 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> in placebo group).</p>
<p>Although there was a non-significant reduction in the number of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4138412" conceptname="Fracture of proximal end of femur">hip fractures</span> (9 on NOLVADEX, 20 on placebo) in the NOLVADEX group, the number of wrist <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">fractures</span> was similar in the two treatment groups (69 on NOLVADEX, 74 on placebo).  A subgroup analysis of the P-1 trial, suggests a difference in effect in bone mineral density (BMD) related to menopausal status in patients receiving NOLVADEX.  In postmenopausal women there was no evidence of bone loss of the lumbar spine and hip.  Conversely, NOLVADEX was associated with significant bone loss of the lumbar spine and hip in premenopausal women.</p>
<p>The risks of NOLVADEX therapy include endometrial cancer, DVT, PE, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">cataract</span> formation and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">cataract</span> surgery (See <a href="#wherry1138991295002">Table 3</a>).  In the NSABP P-1 trial, 33 cases of endometrial cancer were observed in the NOLVADEX group vs. 14 in the placebo group (RR=2.48, 95% CI: 1.27-4.92). <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4042396" conceptname="Deep thrombophlebitis">Deep vein thrombosis</span> was observed in 30 women receiving NOLVADEX vs. 19 in women receiving placebo (RR=1.59, 95% CI: 0.86-2.98). Eighteen cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440417" conceptname="Pulmonary embolism">pulmonary embolism</span> were observed in the NOLVADEX group vs. 6 in the placebo group (RR=3.01, 95% CI: 1.15-9.27).  There were 34 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">strokes</span> on the NOLVADEX arm and 24 on the placebo arm (RR=1.42; 95% CI: 0.82-2.51).  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">Cataract</span> formation in women without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">cataracts</span> at baseline was observed in 540 women taking NOLVADEX vs. 483 women receiving placebo (RR=1.13, 95% CI: 1.00-1.28).  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">Cataract</span> surgery  (with or without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">cataracts</span> at baseline) was performed in 201 women taking NOLVADEX vs. 129 women receiving placebo (RR=1.51, 95% CI: 1.21-1.89) (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#wherry1138991410042">WARNINGS</a></span>).</p>
<p>Table 3 summarizes the major outcomes of the NSABP P-1 trial.   For each endpoint, the following results are presented: the number of events and rate per 1000 women per year for the placebo and NOLVADEX groups; and the relative risk (RR) and its associated 95% confidence interval (CI) between NOLVADEX and placebo.  Relative risks less than 1.0 indicate a benefit of NOLVADEX therapy.  The limits of the confidence intervals can be used to assess the statistical significance of the benefits or risks of NOLVADEX therapy.  If the upper limit of the CI is less than 1.0, then a statistically significant benefit exists. </p>
<p>For most participants, multiple risk factors would have been required for eligibility.  This table considers risk factors individually, regardless of other co-existing risk factors, for women who  developed breast cancer.  The 5-year predicted absolute breast cancer risk accounts for multiple risk factors in an individual and should provide the best estimate of individual benefit (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#wherry1138991398779">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</a></span>).</p>

<p>Interim results from 2 trials in addition to the NSABP P-1 trial examining the effects of tamoxifen in reducing breast cancer incidence have been reported.</p>
<p>The first was the Italian Tamoxifen Prevention trial.  In this trial women between the ages of 35 and 70, who had had a total hysterectomy, were randomized to receive 20 mg tamoxifen or matching placebo for 5 years.  The primary endpoints were occurrence of, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> from, invasive breast cancer.  Women without any specific risk factors for breast cancer were to be entered.  Between 1992 and 1997, 5408 women were randomized.  Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) was used in 14% of participants.  The trial closed in 1997 due to the large number of dropouts during the first year of treatment (26%).  After 46 months of follow-up there were 22 breast cancers in women on placebo and 19 in women on tamoxifen. Although no decrease in breast cancer incidence was observed, there was a trend for a reduction in breast cancer among women receiving protocol therapy for at least 1 year (19-placebo, 11- tamoxifen).  The small numbers of participants along with the low level of risk in this otherwise healthy group precluded an adequate assessment of the effect of tamoxifen in reducing the incidence of breast cancer.</p>
<p>The second trial, the Royal Marsden Trial (RMT) was reported as an interim analysis.  The RMT was begun in 1986 as a feasibility study of whether larger scale trials could be mounted. The trial was subsequently extended to a pilot trial to accrue additional participants to further assess the safety of tamoxifen.  Twenty-four hundred and seventy-one women were entered between 1986 and 1996; they were selected on the basis of a family history of breast cancer.  HRT was used in 40% of participants.  In this trial, with a 70 month median follow-up, 34 and 36 breast cancers (8 noninvasive, 4 on each arm) were observed among women on tamoxifen and placebo, respectively. Patients in this trial were younger than those in the NSABP P-1 trial and may have been more likely to develop ER (-) tumors, which are unlikely to be reduced in number by tamoxifen therapy.  Although women were selected on the basis of family history and were thought to have a high risk of breast cancer, few events occurred, reducing the statistical power of the study. These factors are potential reasons why the RMT may not have provided an adequate assessment of the effectiveness of tamoxifen in reducing the incidence of breast cancer.</p>
<p>In these trials, an increased number of cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4042396" conceptname="Deep thrombophlebitis">deep vein thrombosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440417" conceptname="Pulmonary embolism">pulmonary embolus</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, and endometrial cancer were observed on the tamoxifen arm compared to the placebo arm.  The frequency of events was consistent with the safety data observed in the NSABP P-1 trial.</p>

<h3>McCune-Albright Syndrome:</h3>
<p class="First">A single, uncontrolled multicenter trial of NOLVADEX 20 mg once a day was conducted in a heterogenous group of girls with McCune-Albright Syndrome and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4267558" conceptname="Precocious puberty">precocious puberty</span> manifested by physical signs of pubertal development, episodes of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129155" conceptname="Vaginal bleeding">vaginal bleeding</span> and/or advanced bone age (bone age of at least 12 months beyond chronological age).  Twenty-eight female pediatric patients, aged 2 to 10 years, were treated for up to 12 months.  Effect of treatment on frequency of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129155" conceptname="Vaginal bleeding">vaginal bleeding</span>, bone age advancement, and linear growth rate was assessed relative to prestudy baseline.  NOLVADEX treatment was associated with a 50% reduction in frequency of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129155" conceptname="Vaginal bleeding">vaginal bleeding</span> episodes by patient or family report (mean annualized frequency of 3.56 episodes at baseline and 1.73 episodes on-treatment).  Among the patients who reported <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129155" conceptname="Vaginal bleeding">vaginal bleeding</span> during the pre-study period, 62% (13 out of 21 patients) reported no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> for a 6-month period and 33% (7 out of 21 patients) reported no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129155" conceptname="Vaginal bleeding">vaginal bleeding</span> for the duration of the trial.  Not all patients improved on treatment and a few patients not reporting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129155" conceptname="Vaginal bleeding">vaginal bleeding</span> in the 6 months prior to enrollment reported menses on treatment.  NOLVADEX therapy was associated with a reduction in mean rate of increase of bone age.  Individual responses with regard to bone age advancement were highly heterogeneous.  Linear growth rate was reduced during the course of NOLVADEX treatment in a majority of patients (mean change of 1.68 cm/year relative to baseline; change from 7.47 cm/year at baseline to 5.79 cm/year on study).  This change was not uniformly seen across all stages of bone maturity; all recorded response failures occurred in patients with bone ages less than 7 years at screening. </p>
<p>Mean uterine volume increased after 6 months of treatment and doubled at the end of the one-year study.  A causal relationship has not been established; however, as an increase in the incidence of endometrial adenocarcinoma and uterine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084784" conceptname="Sarcoma">sarcoma</span> has been noted in adults treated with NOLVADEX  (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#wherry1138991318763">BOXED WARNING</a></span>), continued monitoring of McCune-Albright patients treated with NOLVADEX for long-term uterine effects is recommended.  <span class="Bold">The safety and efficacy of NOLVADEX for girls aged two to 10 years with McCune-Albright Syndrome and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4267558" conceptname="Precocious puberty">precocious puberty</span> have not been studied beyond one year of treatment.

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="">
<a name="section-4.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Metastatic Breast Cancer: </h2>
<p class="First">NOLVADEX is effective in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in women and men.  In premenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer, NOLVADEX is an alternative to oophorectomy or ovarian irradiation.  Available evidence indicates that patients whose tumors are estrogen receptor positive are more likely to benefit from NOLVADEX therapy.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="">
<a name="section-4.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer:</h2>
<p class="First">NOLVADEX is indicated for the treatment of node-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women following total mastectomy or segmental mastectomy, axillary dissection, and breast irradiation. In some NOLVADEX adjuvant studies, most of the benefit to date has been in the subgroup with four or more positive axillary nodes.</p>
<p>NOLVADEX is indicated for the treatment of axillary node-negative breast cancer in women following total mastectomy or segmental mastectomy, axillary dissection, and breast irradiation. </p>
<p>The estrogen and progesterone receptor values may help to predict whether adjuvant NOLVADEX therapy is likely to be beneficial.</p>
<p>NOLVADEX reduces the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer in patients receiving adjuvant NOLVADEX therapy for breast cancer.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="">
<a name="section-4.3"></a><p></p>
<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4313969" conceptname="Intraductal carcinoma, noninfiltrating">Ductal Carcinoma in Situ</span> (DCIS):</h2>
<p class="First">In women with DCIS, following breast surgery and radiation, NOLVADEX is indicated to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#wherry1138991318763">BOXED WARNING</a></span> at the beginning of the label). The decision regarding therapy with NOLVADEX for the reduction in breast cancer incidence should be based upon an individual assessment of the benefits and risks of NOLVADEX therapy.</p>
<p>Current data from clinical trials support five years of adjuvant NOLVADEX therapy for patients with breast cancer.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="">
<a name="section-4.4"></a><p></p>
<h2>Reduction in Breast Cancer Incidence in High Risk Women:</h2>
<p class="First">NOLVADEX is indicated to reduce the incidence of breast cancer in women at high risk for breast cancer.  This effect was shown in a study of 5 years planned duration with a median follow-up of 4.2 years.  Twenty-five percent of the participants received drug for 5 years.  The longer-term effects are not known.  In this study, there was no impact of tamoxifen on overall or breast cancer-related mortality (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#wherry1138991318763">BOXED WARNING</a></span> at the beginning of the label).</p>
<p>NOLVADEX is indicated only for high-risk women.  “High risk? is defined as women at least 35 years of age with a 5-year predicted risk of breast cancer ≥ 1.67%, as calculated by the Gail Model.</p>
<p>Examples of combinations of factors predicting a 5-year risk ≥ 1.67% are:</p>

<h2>Effects on the Uterus-Endometrial Cancer and Uterine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084784" conceptname="Sarcoma">Sarcoma</span>:</h2>
<p class="First">An increased incidence of uterine malignancies has been reported in association with NOLVADEX treatment.  The underlying mechanism is unknown, but may be related to the estrogen-like effect of NOLVADEX. Most uterine malignancies seen in association with NOLVADEX are classified as adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  However, rare uterine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084784" conceptname="Sarcoma">sarcomas</span>, including malignant mixed mullerian tumors (MMMT), have also been reported.  Uterine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084784" conceptname="Sarcoma">sarcoma</span> is generally associated with a higher FIGO stage (III/IV) at diagnosis, poorer prognosis, and shorter survival.  Uterine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084784" conceptname="Sarcoma">sarcoma</span> has been reported to occur more frequently among long-term users (≥ 2 years) of NOLVADEX than non-users. Some of the uterine malignancies (endometrial carcinoma or uterine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084784" conceptname="Sarcoma">sarcoma</span>) have been fatal.</p>
<p>In the NSABP P-1 trial, among participants randomized to NOLVADEX there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of endometrial cancer (33 cases of invasive endometrial cancer, compared to 14 cases among participants randomized to placebo (RR=2.48, 95% CI: 1.27-4.92). The 33 cases in participants receiving NOLVADEX were FIGO Stage I, including 20 IA, 12 IB, and 1 IC endometrial adenocarcinomas.  In participants randomized to placebo, 13 were FIGO Stage I (8 IA and 5 IB) and 1 was FIGO Stage IV.  Five women on NOLVADEX and 1 on placebo received postoperative radiation therapy in addition to surgery.  This increase was primarily observed among women at least 50 years of age at the time of randomization (26 cases of invasive endometrial cancer, compared to 6 cases among participants randomized to placebo (RR=4.50, 95% CI: 1.78-13.16).  Among women ≤ 49 years of age at the time of randomization there were 7 cases of invasive endometrial cancer, compared to 8 cases among participants randomized to placebo (RR=0.94, 95% CI: 0.28-2.89). If age at the time of diagnosis is considered, there were 4 cases of endometrial cancer among participants ≤ 49 randomized to NOLVADEX compared to 2 among participants randomized to placebo (RR=2.21, 95% CI: 0.4-12.0).  For women ≥ 50 at the time of diagnosis, there were 29 cases among participants randomized to NOLVADEX compared to 12 among women on placebo (RR=2.5, 95% CI: 1.3-4.9).  The risk ratios were similar in the two groups, although fewer events occurred in younger women.  Most (29 of 33 cases in the NOLVADEX group) endometrial cancers were diagnosed in symptomatic women, although 5 of 33 cases in the NOLVADEX group occurred in asymptomatic women. Among women receiving NOLVADEX the events appeared between 1 and 61 months (average=32 months) from the start of treatment. </p>
<p>In an updated review of long-term data (median length of total follow-up is 6.9 years, including blinded follow-up) on 8,306 women with an intact uterus at randomization in the NSABP P-1 risk reduction trial, the incidence of both adenocarcinomas and rare uterine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084784" conceptname="Sarcoma">sarcomas</span> was increased in women taking NOLVADEX.  During blinded follow-up, there were 36 cases of FIGO Stage I endometrial adenocarcinoma (22 were FIGO Stage IA, 13 IB, and 1 IC) in women receiving NOLVADEX and 15 cases in women receiving placebo [14 were FIGO Stage I (9 IA and 5 IB), and 1 case was FIGO Stage IV].  Of the patients receiving NOLVADEX who developed endometrial cancer, one with Stage IA and 4 with Stage IB cancers received radiation therapy.  In the placebo group, one patient with FIGO Stage 1B cancer received radiation therapy and the patient with FIGO Stage IVB cancer received chemotherapy and hormonal therapy.  During total follow-up, endometrial adenocarcinoma was reported in 53 women randomized to NOLVADEX (30 cases of FIGO Stage IA, 20 were Stage IB, 1 was Stage IC, and 2 were Stage IIIC), and 17 women randomized to placebo (9 cases were FIGO Stage IA, 6 were Stage IB, 1 was Stage IIIC, and 1 was Stage IVB) (incidence per 1,000 women-years of 2.20 and 0.71, respectively).  Some patients received post-operative radiation therapy in addition to surgery.    Uterine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084784" conceptname="Sarcoma">sarcomas</span> were reported in 4 women randomized to NOLVADEX (1 was FIGO IA, 1 was FIGO IB, 1 was FIGO IIA, and 1 was FIGO IIIC) and one patient randomized to placebo (FIGO 1A); incidence per 1,000 women-years of 0.17 and 0.04, respectively.  Of the patients randomized to NOLVADEX, the FIGO IA and IB cases were a MMMT and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084784" conceptname="Sarcoma">sarcoma</span>, respectively; the FIGO II was a MMMT; and the FIGO III was a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084784" conceptname="Sarcoma">sarcoma</span>; and the one patient randomized to placebo had a MMMT.  A similar increased incidence in endometrial adenocarcinoma and uterine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084784" conceptname="Sarcoma">sarcoma</span> was observed among women receiving NOLVADEX in five other NSABP clinical trials.  </p>
<p>Any patient receiving or who has previously received NOLVADEX who reports abnormal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129155" conceptname="Vaginal bleeding">vaginal bleeding</span> should be promptly evaluated. Patients receiving or who have previously received NOLVADEX should have annual gynecological examinations and they should promptly inform their physicians if they experience any abnormal gynecological symptoms, eg, menstrual irregularities, abnormal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129155" conceptname="Vaginal bleeding">vaginal bleeding</span>, changes in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4155070" conceptname="Vaginal discharge">vaginal discharge</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4147829" conceptname="Pain in pelvis">pelvic pain</span> or pressure.</p>
<p>In the P-1 trial, endometrial sampling did not alter the endometrial cancer detection rate compared to women who did not undergo endometrial sampling (0.6% with sampling, 0.5% without sampling) for women with an intact uterus. There are no data to suggest that routine endometrial sampling in asymptomatic women taking NOLVADEX to reduce the incidence of breast cancer would be beneficial.</p>

<h2>Thromboembolic Effects of NOLVADEX:</h2>
<p class="First">There is evidence of an increased incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185607" conceptname="Embolism">thromboembolic events</span>, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4042396" conceptname="Deep thrombophlebitis">deep vein thrombosis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440417" conceptname="Pulmonary embolism">pulmonary embolism</span>, during NOLVADEX therapy.  When NOLVADEX is coadminstered with chemotherapy, there may be a further increase in the incidence of thromboembolic effects.  For treatment of breast cancer, the risks and benefits of NOLVADEX should be carefully considered in women with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185607" conceptname="Embolism">thromboembolic events</span>. In a subsmall study (N=81) of the NSABP P-1 trial, there appeared to be no benefit to screening women for Factor V Leiden and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">Prothrombin</span> mutations G20210A as a means to identify those who may not be appropriate candidates for NOLVADEX therapy.</p>
<p>Data from the NSABP P-1 trial show that participants receiving NOLVADEX without a history of pulmonary emboli (PE) had a statistically significant increase in pulmonary emboli (18-NOLVADEX, 6-placebo, RR=3.01, 95% CI: 1.15- 9.27).  Three of the pulmonary emboli, all in the NOLVADEX arm, were fatal. Eighty-seven percent of the cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440417" conceptname="Pulmonary embolism">pulmonary embolism</span> occurred in women at least 50 years of age at randomization.  Among women receiving NOLVADEX, the events appeared between 2 and 60 months (average=27 months) from the start of treatment.</p>
<p>In this same population, a non-statistically significant increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4042396" conceptname="Deep thrombophlebitis">deep vein thrombosis</span> (DVT) was seen in the NOLVADEX group (30-NOLVADEX, 19-placebo; RR=1.59, 95% CI: 0.86-2.98). The same increase in relative risk was seen in women ≤ 49 and in women ≥ 50, although fewer events occurred in younger women. Women with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185607" conceptname="Embolism">thromboembolic events</span> were at risk for a second related event (7 out of 25 women on placebo, 5 out of 48 women on NOLVADEX) and were at risk for complications of the event and its treatment (0/25 on placebo, 4/48 on NOLVADEX). Among women receiving NOLVADEX, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4042396" conceptname="Deep thrombophlebitis">deep vein thrombosis</span> events occurred between 2 and 57 months (average=19 months) from the start of treatment.</p>
<p>There was a non-statistically significant increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> among patients randomized to NOLVADEX (24-Placebo; 34-NOLVADEX; RR=1.42; 95% CI 0.82-2.51). Six of the 24 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">strokes</span> in the placebo group were considered hemorrhagic in origin and 10 of the 34 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">strokes</span> in the NOLVADEX group were categorized as hemorrhagic.  Seventeen of the 34 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">strokes</span> in the NOLVADEX group were considered occlusive and 7 were considered to be of unknown etiology.  Fourteen of the 24 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">strokes</span> on the placebo arm were reported to be occlusive and 4 of unknown etiology.

<h2>Effects on the liver:  Non-malignant effects:</h2>

<h2>Pregnancy Category D:</h2>
<p class="First">NOLVADEX may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.  Women should be advised not to become pregnant while taking NOLVADEX <span class="Underline">or within</span> 2 months of discontinuing NOLVADEX and should use barrier or nonhormonal contraceptive measures if sexually active.  Tamoxifen does not cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4035976" conceptname="Sterility">infertility</span>, even in the presence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196168" conceptname="Irregular periods">menstrual irregularity</span>.  Effects on reproductive functions are expected from the antiestrogenic properties of the drug.  In reproductive studies in rats at dose levels equal to or below the human dose, nonteratogenic developmental skeletal changes were seen and were found reversible.  In addition, in fertility studies in rats and in teratology studies in rabbits using doses at or below those used in humans, a lower incidence of embryo implantation and a higher incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079844" conceptname="Fetal death">fetal death</span> or retarded in utero growth were observed, with slower learning behavior in some rat pups when compared to historical controls.  Several pregnant marmosets were dosed with 10 mg/kg/day (about 2-fold the daily maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) during organogenesis or in the last half of pregnancy.  No deformations were seen and, although the dose was high enough to terminate pregnancy in some animals, those that did maintain pregnancy showed no evidence of teratogenic malformations.</p>
<p>In rodent models of fetal reproductive tract development, tamoxifen (at doses 0.002 to 2.4-fold the daily maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) caused changes in both sexes that are similar to those caused by estradiol, ethynylestradiol and diethylstilbestrol.  Although the clinical relevance of these changes is unknown, some of these changes, especially <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242227" conceptname="Vaginal adenosis">vaginal adenosis</span>, are similar to those seen in young women who were exposed to diethylstilbestrol in utero and who have a 1 in 1000 risk of developing clear-cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina or cervix.  To date, in utero exposure to tamoxifen has not been shown to cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242227" conceptname="Vaginal adenosis">vaginal adenosis</span>, or clear-cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina or cervix, in young women.  However, only a small number of young women have been exposed to tamoxifen in utero, and a smaller number have been followed long enough (to age 15-20) to determine whether vaginal or cervical neoplasia could occur as a result of this exposure.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of tamoxifen in pregnant women.  There have been a small number of reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129155" conceptname="Vaginal bleeding">vaginal bleeding</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4067106" conceptname="Miscarriage">spontaneous abortions</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079844" conceptname="Fetal death">fetal deaths</span> in pregnant women.

<h2>Information for Patients:</h2>
<p class="First">Patients should be instructed to read the Medication Guide supplied as required by law when NOLVADEX is dispensed. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.</p>

<h3>Reduction in Invasive Breast Cancer and DCIS in Women with DCIS:</h3>
<p class="First">Women with DCIS treated with lumpectomy and radiation therapy who are considering NOLVADEX to reduce the incidence of a second breast cancer event should assess the risks and benefits of therapy, since treatment with NOLVADEX decreased the incidence of invasive breast cancer, but has not been shown to affect survival (See <a href="#wherry1138991684802">Table 1</a> in <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>).</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="">

<h3>Reduction in Breast Cancer Incidence in High Risk Women:</h3>
<p class="First">Women who are at high risk for breast cancer can consider taking NOLVADEX therapy to reduce the incidence of breast cancer. Whether the benefits of treatment are considered to outweigh the risks depends on a woman's personal health history and on how she weighs the benefits and risks.  NOLVADEX therapy to reduce the incidence of breast cancer may therefore not be appropriate for all women at high risk for breast cancer.  Women who are considering NOLVADEX therapy should consult their health care professional for an assessment of the potential benefits and risks prior to starting therapy for reduction in breast cancer incidence (See <a href="#wherry1138991295002">Table 3</a>in <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>).  Women should understand that NOLVADEX reduces the incidence of breast cancer, but may not eliminate risk. NOLVADEX decreased the incidence of small estrogen receptor positive tumors, but did not alter the incidence of estrogen receptor negative tumors or larger tumors. In women with breast cancer who are at high risk of developing a second breast cancer, treatment with about 5 years of NOLVADEX reduced the annual incidence rate of a second breast cancer by approximately 50%. </p>
<p>Women who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant should not take NOLVADEX to reduce her risk of breast cancer. Effective nonhormonal contraception must be used by all premenopausal women taking NOLVADEX and for approximately two months after discontinuing therapy if they are sexually active. Tamoxifen does not cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4035976" conceptname="Sterility">infertility</span>, even in the presence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196168" conceptname="Irregular periods">menstrual irregularity</span>.  For sexually active women of child-bearing potential, NOLVADEX therapy should be initiated during menstruation.  In women with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196168" conceptname="Irregular periods">menstrual irregularity</span>, a negative B-HCG immediately prior to the initiation of therapy is sufficient (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#wherry1138991726825">WARNINGS-Pregnancy Category D</a></span>).</p>
<p>Two European trials of tamoxifen to reduce the risk of breast cancer were conducted and showed no difference in the number of breast cancer cases between the tamoxifen and placebo arms.  These studies had trial designs that differed from that of NSABP P-1, were smaller than NSABP P-1, and enrolled women at a lower risk for breast cancer than those in P-1.  </p>

<h3>Monitoring During NOLVADEX Therapy:</h3>
<p class="First">Women taking or having previously taken NOLVADEX should be instructed to seek prompt medical attention for new <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80767" conceptname="Breast lump">breast lumps</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129155" conceptname="Vaginal bleeding">vaginal bleeding</span>, gynecologic symptoms (menstrual irregularities, changes in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4155070" conceptname="Vaginal discharge">vaginal discharge</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4147829" conceptname="Pain in pelvis">pelvic pain</span> or pressure), symptoms of leg <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4082445" conceptname="Tenderness">tenderness</span>, unexplained <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">shortness of breath</span>, or changes in vision.  Women should inform all care providers, regardless of the reason for evaluation, that they take NOLVADEX.</p>
<p>Women taking NOLVADEX to reduce the incidence of breast cancer should have a breast examination, a mammogram, and a gynecologic examination prior to the initiation of therapy.  These studies should be repeated at regular intervals while on therapy, in keeping with good medical practice. Women taking NOLVADEX as adjuvant breast cancer therapy should follow the same monitoring procedures as for women taking NOLVADEX for the reduction in the incidence of breast cancer.  Women taking NOLVADEX as treatment for metastatic breast cancer should review this monitoring plan with their care provider and select the appropriate modalities and schedule of evaluation.</p>

<h2>Laboratory Tests:</h2>
<p class="First">Periodic complete blood counts, including platelet counts, and periodic liver function tests should be obtained.</p>
<p>During the ATAC trial, more patients receiving anastrozole were reported to have an elevated serum <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> compared to patients receiving NOLVADEX (9% versus 3.5%, respectively).  </p>

<h2>Drug Interactions:</h2>
<p class="First">When NOLVADEX is used in combination with coumarin-type anticoagulants, a significant increase in anticoagulant effect may occur.  Where such coadministration exists, careful monitoring of the patient's <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time is recommended. </p>
<p>In the NSABP P-1 trial, women who required coumarin-type anticoagulants for any reason were ineligible for participation in the trial (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#wherry1138991761944">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span>).</p>
<p>There is an increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185607" conceptname="Embolism">thromboembolic events</span> occurring when cytotoxic agents are used in combination with NOLVADEX.</p>
<p>Tamoxifen reduced letrozole plasma concentrations by 37%.  The effect of tamoxifen on metabolism and excretion of other antineoplastic drugs, such as cyclophosphamide and other drugs that require mixed function oxidases for activation, is not known.  Tamoxifen and N-desmethyl tamoxifen plasma concentrations have been shown to be reduced when coadministered with rifampin or aminoglutethimide.  Induction of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism is considered to be the mechanism by which these reductions occur; other CYP3A4 inducing agents have not been studied to confirm this effect.</p>
<p>One patient receiving NOLVADEX with concomitant phenobarbital exhibited a steady state serum level of tamoxifen lower than that observed for other patients (ie, 26 ng/mL vs. mean value of 122 ng/mL).  However, the clinical significance of this finding is not known. Rifampin induced the metabolism of tamoxifen and significantly reduced the plasma concentrations of tamoxifen in 10 patients. Aminoglutethimide reduces tamoxifen and N-desmethyl tamoxifen plasma concentrations. Medroxyprogesterone reduces plasma concentrations of N-desmethyl, but not tamoxifen. </p>
<p>Concomitant bromocriptine therapy has been shown to elevate serum tamoxifen and N-desmethyl tamoxifen.</p>
<p>Based on clinical and pharmacokinetic results from the anastrozole adjuvant trial, NOLVADEX should not be administered with anastrozole (see <a href="#rowellsl1141320962799">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY – Drug-Drug Interactions </a>section).</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis:</h2>

The incidence of these tumors was significantly greater among rats administered 20 or 35 mg/kg/day (69%) compared to those administered 5 mg/kg/day (14%).  In a separate study, rats were administered tamoxifen at 45 mg/kg/day (about nine-fold the daily maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis); hepatocellular neoplasia was exhibited at 3 to 6 months.</p>
<p>Granulosa cell ovarian tumors and interstitial cell testicular tumors were observed in two separate mouse studies.  The mice were administered the trans and racemic forms of tamoxifen for 13 to 15 months at doses of 5, 20 and 50 mg/kg/day (about one-half, two and five-fold the daily recommended human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers:</h2>
<p class="First">Tamoxifen has been reported to inhibit lactation.  Two placebo-controlled studies in over 150 women have shown that tamoxifen significantly inhibits early postpartum milk production. In both studies tamoxifen was administered within 24 hours of delivery for between 5 and 18 days.  The effect of tamoxifen on established milk production is not known.  </p>
<p>There are no data that address whether tamoxifen is excreted into human milk.  If excreted, there are no data regarding the effects of tamoxifen in breast milk on the breastfed infant or breastfed animals.  However, direct neonatal exposure of tamoxifen to mice and rats (not via breast milk) produced 1) reproductive tract lesions in female rodents (similar to those seen in humans after intrauterine exposure to diethylstilbestrol) and 2) functional defects of the reproductive tract in male rodents such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438477" conceptname="Atrophy of testis">testicular atrophy</span> and arrest of spermatogenesis.  </p>
<p>It is not known if NOLVADEX is excreted in human milk.  Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from NOLVADEX, women taking NOLVADEX should not breast feed.</p>

<h2>Male Breast Cancer:</h2>
<p class="First">NOLVADEX is well tolerated in males with breast cancer.  Reports from the literature and case reports suggest that the safety profile of NOLVADEX in males is similar to that seen in women.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4087317" conceptname="Lack of libido">Loss of libido</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">impotence</span> have resulted in discontinuation of tamoxifen therapy in male patients.  Also, in oligospermic males treated with tamoxifen, LH, FSH, testosterone and estrogen levels were elevated.  No significant clinical changes were reported.</p>

<h2>Adjuvant Breast Cancer:</h2>
<p class="First">In the NSABP B-14 study, women with axillary node-negative breast cancer were randomized to 5 years of NOLVADEX 20 mg/day or placebo following primary surgery.  The reported adverse effects are tabulated below (mean follow-up of approximately 6.8 years) showing adverse events more common on NOLVADEX than on placebo.  The incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113666" conceptname="Menopausal flushing">hot flashes</span> (64% vs. 48%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4155070" conceptname="Vaginal discharge">vaginal discharge</span> (30% vs. 15%), and irregular menses (25% vs. 19%) were higher with NOLVADEX compared with placebo. All other adverse effects occurred with  similar frequency in the 2 treatment groups, with the exception of thrombotic events; a higher incidence was seen in NOLVADEX-treated patients (through 5 years, 1.7% vs. 0.4%). Two of the patients treated with NOLVADEX who had thrombotic events died.</p>

<p>In the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) adjuvant breast cancer trial, NOLVADEX or placebo was administered for 2 years to women following mastectomy. When compared to placebo, NOLVADEX showed a significantly higher incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113666" conceptname="Menopausal flushing">hot flashes</span> (19% vs. 8% for placebo).  The incidence of all other adverse reactions was similar in the 2 treatment groups with the exception of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span> where the incidence for NOLVADEX was 10% vs. 3% for placebo, an observation of borderline statistical significance.</p>
<p>In other adjuvant studies, Toronto and NOLVADEX Adjuvant Trial Organization (NATO), women received either NOLVADEX or no therapy.  In the Toronto study, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113666" conceptname="Menopausal flushing">hot flashes</span> were observed in 29% of patients for NOLVADEX vs. 1% in the untreated group.

<h2>Anastrozole Adjuvant Trial — Study of Anastrozole compared to NOLVADEX for Adjuvant Treatment of Early Breast Cancer </h2>
<p class="First">See <a href="#rowellsl1167772897187">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Clinical Studies</a>. At a median follow-up of 33 months, the combination of anastrozole and NOLVADEX did not demonstrate any efficacy benefit when compared to NOLVADEX therapy given alone, in all patients as well as in the hormone receptor positive subpopulation. This treatment arm was discontinued from the trial. The median duration of adjuvant treatment for safety evaluation was 59.8 months and 59.6 months for patients receiving anastrozole 1 mg and NOLVADEX 20 mg, respectively. </p>
<p>Adverse events occurring with an incidence of at least 5% in either treatment group during treatment or within 14 days of the end of treatment are presented in the following table.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">For patients with breast cancer, the recommended daily dose is 20-40 mg.  Dosages greater than 20 mg per day should be given in divided doses (morning and evening).</p>
<p>In three single agent adjuvant studies in women, one 10 mg NOLVADEX tablet was administered two (ECOG and NATO) or three (Toronto) times a day for two years. In the NSABP B-14 adjuvant study in women with node-negative breast cancer, one 10 mg NOLVADEX tablet was given twice a day for at least 5 years. Results of the B-14 study suggest that continuation of therapy beyond five years does not provide additional benefit (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#wherry1138992014583">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span>). In the EBCTCG 1995 overview, the reduction in recurrence and mortality was greater in those studies that used tamoxifen for about 5 years than in those that used tamoxifen for a shorter period of therapy.  There was no indication that doses greater than 20 mg per day were more effective. Current data from clinical trials support 5 years of adjuvant NOLVADEX therapy for patients with breast cancer.</p>

<h2>Medication guide</h2>
<p class="First">NOLVADEX® (Nole-vah-dex) Tablets</p>
<p>Generic name:  tamoxifen (ta-MOX-I-fen)</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Written for women who use NOLVADEX to lower their high chance of getting breast cancer or who have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4313969" conceptname="Intraductal carcinoma, noninfiltrating">ductal carcinoma in situ</span> (DCIS)</span></p>
<p>People taking NOLVADEX <span class="Bold">to treat</span> breast cancer have different benefits and different decisions to make than high-risk women or women with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4313969" conceptname="Intraductal carcinoma, noninfiltrating">ductal carcinoma in situ</span> (DCIS) taking NOLVADEX to reduce the chance of getting breast cancer.  If you already have breast cancer, talk with your doctor about how the benefits of treating breast cancer with NOLVADEX compare to the risks that are described in this document.  </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Why should I read this Medication Guide?</span></p>
<p>This guide has information to help you decide whether to use NOLVADEX to lower your chance of getting breast cancer.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">You and your doctor should talk about whether the possible benefit of NOLVADEX in lowering your high chance of getting breast cancer is greater than its possible risks.</span>  Your doctor has a special computer program or hand-held calculator to tell if you are in the high-risk group.  If you have DCIS and have been treated with surgery and radiation therapy, your doctor may prescribe NOLVADEX to decrease your chance of getting invasive (spreading) breast cancer.</p>
<p>Read this guide carefully before you start NOLVADEX.  It is important to read the information you get each time you get more medicine.   There may be something new.  This guide does not tell you everything about NOLVADEX and does <span class="Bold">not</span> take the place of talking with your doctor.</p>
<p>Only you and your doctor can determine if NOLVADEX is right for you.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What is the most important information I should know about using NOLVADEX to reduce the chance of getting breast cancer?</span></p>
<p>NOLVADEX is a prescription medicine that is like estrogen (female hormone) in some ways and different in other ways.  In the breast, NOLVADEX can block estrogen’s effects.  Because it does this, NOLVADEX may block the growth of breast cancers that need estrogen to grow (cancers that are estrogen- or progesterone-receptor positive).</p>
<p>NOLVADEX can lower the chance of getting breast cancer in women with a higher than normal chance of getting breast cancer in the next five years (high-risk women) and women with DCIS.  <span class="Bold">Because high-risk women don’t have cancer yet, it is important to think carefully about whether the possible benefit of NOLVADEX in lowering the chance of getting breast cancer is greater than its possible risks.</span></p>
<p>This Medication Guide reviews the risks and benefits of using NOLVADEX to reduce the chance of getting breast cancer in high-risk women and women with DCIS.  This guide does <span class="Bold">not</span> discuss the special benefits and decisions for people who already have breast cancer.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Why do women and men use NOLVADEX?</span></p>
<p>NOLVADEX has more than one use.  NOLVADEX is used:</p>
<p><span class="Bold">to lower the chance</span> of getting breast cancer in women with a higher than normal chance of getting breast cancer in the next 5 years (high-risk women)</p>
<p><span class="Bold">to lower the chance</span> of getting invasive (spreading) breast cancer in women who had surgery and radiation for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4313969" conceptname="Intraductal carcinoma, noninfiltrating">ductal carcinoma in situ</span> (DCIS).  DCIS means the cancer is only inside the milk ducts.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">to treat</span> breast cancer in women after they have finished early treatment. Early treatment can include surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.  NOLVADEX may keep the cancer from spreading to others parts of the body.  It may also reduce the woman’s chance of getting a new breast cancer.</p>
<p>in women and men, <span class="Bold">to treat</span> breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic breast cancer).</p>
<p>This guide talks only about using NOLVADEX to lower the chance of getting breast cancer (#1 and #2 above).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What are the benefits of NOLVADEX to lower the chance of getting breast cancer in high-risk women and in women treated for DCIS?</span></p>
<p>A large US study looked at<span class="Bold"> high-risk women</span> and compared the ones who took NOLVADEX for 5 years with others who took a pill without NOLVADEX (placebo).  High-risk women were defined as women who have a 1.7% or greater chance of getting breast cancer in the next 5 years, based on a special computer program.  In this study:</p>
<p>Out of every 1,000 high-risk women <span class="Bold">who took a placebo</span>, each year about 7 got breast cancer.</p>
<p>Out of every 1,000 high-risk women <span class="Bold">who took NOLVADEX</span>, each year about 4 got breast cancer.</p>
<p>The study showed that on average, high-risk women who took NOLVADEX lowered their chances of getting breast cancer by 44%, from 7 in 1,000 to 4 in 1,000.</p>
<p>Another US study looked at <span class="Bold">women with DCIS</span> and compared those who took NOLVADEX for 5 years with others who took a placebo.  In this study:</p>
<p>Out of every 1,000 women with DCIS <span class="Bold">who took placebo</span>, each year about 17 got breast cancer.</p>
<p>Out of every 1,000 women with DCIS <span class="Bold">who took NOLVADEX</span>, each year about 10 got breast cancer.</p>
<p>The study showed that on average, women with DCIS who took NOLVADEX lowered their chances of getting invasive (spreading) breast cancer by 43%, from 17 in 1,000 to 10 in 1,000.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">These studies do not mean that taking NOLVADEX will lower your personal chance of getting breast cancer.</span>  We do not know what the benefits will be for any one woman who takes NOLVADEX to reduce her chance of getting breast cancer.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What are the risks of NOLVADEX?</span></p>
<p>In the studies described under “What are the benefits of NOLVADEX??, the high-risk women who took NOLVADEX got certain side effects at a higher rate than those who took a placebo.  <span class="Bold">Some of these side effects can cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.</span></p>
<p>In one study, in women who still had their uterus</p>
<p>Out of every 1,000 women who took a placebo, each year 1 got endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the uterus) and none got uterine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084784" conceptname="Sarcoma">sarcoma</span> (cancer of the body of the uterus).  </p>

<p>These results show that, on average, in high-risk women <span class="Bold">who still had their uterus</span><span class="Italics">, </span>NOLVADEX doubled the chance of getting endometrial cancer from 1 in 1,000 to 2 in 1,000, and it increased the chance of getting uterine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084784" conceptname="Sarcoma">sarcoma</span>.  <span class="Bold">This does not mean that taking NOLVADEX will double your personal chance of getting endometrial cancer or increase your chance of getting uterine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084784" conceptname="Sarcoma">sarcoma</span>.</span>  We do not know what this risk will be for any one woman.  The risk is different for women who no longer have their uterus.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">For all women in this study, taking NOLVADEX increased the risk of having a blood clot in their lungs or veins, or of having a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>.</span>  In some cases, women died from these effects.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">Who should not take NOLVADEX?</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Do not take NOLVADEX for any reason if you</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant while taking NOLVADEX or during the 2 months after you stop taking NOLVADEX.  NOLVADEX may harm your unborn baby.</span>  It takes about 2 months to clear NOLVADEX from your body.  To be sure you are not pregnant, you can start taking NOLVADEX while you are having your menstrual period.  Or, you can take a pregnancy test to be sure you are not pregnant before you begin.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Are breast feeding.</span>  We do not know if NOLVADEX can pass through your milk and harm your baby.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Have had an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergic reaction</span> to NOLVADEX or tamoxifen</span> (the other name for NOLVADEX), or to any of its inactive ingredients. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">If you get pregnant while taking NOLVADEX, stop taking it right away and contact your doctor.  NOLVADEX may harm your unborn baby.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Do not take NOLVADEX to lower your chance of getting breast cancer if</span></p>
<p>You ever had a blood clot that needed medical treatment.</p>
<p>You are taking medicines to thin your blood, like warfarin, (also called Coumadin®*).</p>
<p>Your ability to move around is limited for most of your waking hours.</p>
<p>You are at risk for blood clots.  Your doctor can tell you if you are at high risk for blood clots.</p>
<p>You do not have a higher than normal chance of getting breast cancer.  Your doctor can tell you if you are a high-risk woman.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">How should I take NOLVADEX?</span></p>
<p>Swallow the tablet(s) whole, with water or another non-alcoholic liquid.  You can take NOLVADEX with or without food.  Take your medicine every day.  It may be easier to remember if you take it at the same time each day.</p>
<p>If you forget a dose, take it when you remember, then take the next dose as usual.  If it is almost time for your next dose or you remember at your next dose, do not take extra tablets to make up the missed dose.</p>
<p>Take NOLVADEX for 5 years, unless your doctor tells you otherwise.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What should I avoid while taking NOLVADEX?</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Do not become pregnant while taking NOLVADEX or for 2 months after you stop.  </span>NOLVADEX can stop hormonal birth control methods from working.  Hormonal methods include birth control pills, patches, injections, rings and implants.  Therefore, while taking NOLVADEX, <span class="Bold">use birth control methods that don’t use hormones, </span>such as condoms, diaphragms with spermicide, or plain IUD’s.   If you get pregnant, stop taking NOLVADEX right away and call your doctor.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Do not breast feed.  </span>We do not know if NOLVADEX can pass through your milk and if it can harm the baby.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What should I do while taking NOLVADEX?</span></p>
<p>Have regular gynecology check-ups (“female exams?), breast exams and mammograms.  Your doctor will tell you how often.  These will check for signs of breast cancer and cancer of the endometrium (lining of the uterus).  Because NOLVADEX does not prevent all breast cancers, and you may get other types of cancers, you need these exams to find any cancers as early as possible.</p>
<p>Because NOLVADEX can cause serious side effects, pay close attention to your body.  Signs you should look for are listed in “What are the possible side effects of NOLVADEX??</p>
<p>Tell all of the doctors that you see that you are taking NOLVADEX.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor right away if you have any new <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80767" conceptname="Breast lump">breast lumps</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">General information about the safe and effective use of NOLVADEX</span></p>
<p>Medicines are sometimes prescribed for purposes other than those listed in a Medication Guide.  Your doctor has prescribed NOLVADEX only for you.
