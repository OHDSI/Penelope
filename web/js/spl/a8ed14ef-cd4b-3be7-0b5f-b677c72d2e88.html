<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY </h1>
<p class="First">Indomethacin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that exhibits antipyretic and analgesic properties. Its mode of action, like that of other anti-inflammatory drugs, is not known. However, its therapeutic action is not due to pituitary-adrenal stimulation.<br><br>Indomethacin is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis <span class="Italics">in vitro. </span>Concentrations are reached during therapy which have been demonstrated to have an effect <span class="Italics">in vivo </span>as well. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> in animal models. Moreover, prostaglandins are known to be among the mediators of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span>. Since Indomethacin is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.<br><br>Indomethacin has been shown to be an effective antiÂ·inflammatory agent, appropriate for long-term use in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437082" conceptname="Ankylosing spondylitis">ankylosing spondylitis</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80180" conceptname="Osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</span>.<br><br>Indomethacin affords relief of symptoms; it does not alter the progressive course of the underlying disease.<br><br>Indomethacin suppresses <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> as demonstrated by relief of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> and reduction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4082445" conceptname="Tenderness">tenderness</span>. Improvement in patients treated with indomethacin for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> has been demonstrated by a reduction in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154927" conceptname="Joint swelling">joint swelling</span>, average number of joints involved, and morning <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4060220" conceptname="Stiff neck">stiffness</span>; by increased mobility as demonstrated by a decrease in walking time; and by improved functional capability as demonstrated by an increase in grip strength. Indomethacin may enable the reduction of steroid dosage in patients receiving steroids for the more severe forms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span>. In such instances the steroid dosage should be reduced slowly and the patients followed very closely for any possible adverse effects.<br><br>Indomethacin has been reported to diminish basal and CO<span class="Sub">2</span> stimulated cerebral blood flow in healthy volunteers following acute oral and intravenous administration. In one study after one week of treatment with orally administered indomethacin, this effect on basal cerebral blood flow had disappeared. The clinical significance of this effect has not been established.<br><br>Indomethacin capsules have been found effective in relieving the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, reducing the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">redness</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4082445" conceptname="Tenderness">tenderness</span> of acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="74892" conceptname="Articular gout">gouty arthritis</span> - see <a href="#ID_9F122B4F-4816-10B9-CF9D-D48ABCF199D1">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</a>.<br><br>Following single oral doses of indomethacin capsules 25 mg or 50 mg, indomethacin is readily absorbed, attaining peak plasma concentrations of about 1 and 2 mcg/mL,respectively. at about 2 hours. Orally administered indomethacin capsules are virtually 100% bioavailable, with 90% of the dose absorbed within 4 hours.<br><br>Indomethacin is eliminated via renal excretion, metabolism, and biliary excretion. Indomethacin undergoes appreciable enterohepatic circulation. The mean half-life of indomethacin is estimated to be about 4.5 hours. With a typical therapeutic regimen of 25 or 50 mg t.i.d., the steady-state plasma concentrations of indomethacin are an average 1.4 times those following the first dose.<br><br>The rate of absorption is more rapid from the rectal suppository than from indomethacin capsules. Ordinarily, therefore, the total amount absorbed from the suppository would be expected to be at least equivalent to the capsule. In controlled clinical trials, however, the amount of indomethacin absorbed was found to be somewhat less (80-90%) than that absorbed from indomethacin capsules. This is probably because some subjects did not retain the material from the suppository tor the one hour necessary to assure complete absorption. Since the suppository dissolves rather quickly rather than melting slowly, it is seldom recovered in recognizable form if the patient retains the suppository for more than a few minutes.<br><br>Indomethacin exists in the plasma as the parent drug and its desmethyl, desbenzoyl, and desmethyl-desbenzoyl metabolites, all in the unconjugated form. About 60 percent of an oral dosage is recovered in urine as drug and metabolites (26 percent as indomethacin and its glucuronide), and 33 percent is recovered in fecesÂ (1.5 percent as indomethacin).<br><br>About 99% of indomethacin is bound to protein in plasma over the expected range of therapeutic plasma concentrations. Indomethacin has been found to cross the blood-brain barrier and the placenta</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS </h1>
<p class="First">In a gastroscopic study in 45 healthy subjects, the number of gastric mucosal abnormalities was significantly higher in the group receiving indomethacin capsules than in the group taking indomethacin suppositories or placebo.<br><br>In a double-blind comparative clinical study involving 175 patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span>, however, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal adverse with indomethacin suppositories or indomethacin capsules was comparable. The incidence of lower gastrointestinal adverse effects was greater in the suppository group.<br><br>The adverse reactions for indomethacin capsules listed in the following table have been arranged into two groups: (1) incidence greater than 1%; and (2) incidence less than 1%. The incidence for group (1) was obtained from 33 double-blind controlled clinical trials reported in the literature (1,092 patients). The incidence for group (2) was based on reports in clinical trials, in the literature, and on voluntary reports since marketing. The probability of a causal relationship exists between indomethacin and these adverse reactions, some of which have been reported only rarely.<br><br>The adverse reactions reported with indomethacin capsules may occur with use of the suppositories. In addition, rectal irritation and tenesmus have been reported in patients who have received the suppositories.</p>

If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> has not occurred spontaneously, the patient should be induced to vomit with syrup of ipecac. If the patient is unable to vomit, gastric lavage should be performed. Once the stomach has been emptied, 25 or 50 g of activated charcoal may be given. Depending on the condition of the patient, close medical observation and nursing care may be required. The patient should be followed for several days because gastrointestinal ulceration and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">hemorrhage</span> have been reported as adverse reactions of indomethacin. Use of antacids may be helpful.<br><br>The oral LD<span class="Sub">50 </span>of indomethacin in mice and rats (based on 14 day mortality response) was 50 and 12 mg/kg, respectively.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION </h1>
<p class="First">Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of indomethacin and other treatment options before deciding to use Indomethacin Suppositories. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID_49300343-2046-C034-E222-265F8AF92812">WARNINGS</a></span>).<br><br>After observing the response to initial therapy with Indomethacin Suppositories, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patientâ€™s needs.<br><br>IndomethacinÂ is available as 50 mg suppositories for rectal use. THIS SECTION MAKES REFERENCE TO CAPSULE DOSAGE FOR GUIDANCE IN USING SUPPOSITORIES.<br><br>Adverse reactions appear to correlate with the size of the dose of indomethacin in most patients but not all. Therefore, every effort should be made to determine the smallest effective dosage for the individual patient.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Pediatric Use<br></span>Indomethacin ordinarily should not be prescribed for pediatric patients 14 years of age and under (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID_4CB08B9C-E2D8-7B32-D824-2871AD8CDD3E">PRECAUTIONS</a>, Pediatric Use</span>).</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Adult Use<br></span>Dosage Recommendations for Active Stages of the Following:<br>1. Moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> including acute flares of chronic disease; moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437082" conceptname="Ankylosing spondylitis">ankylosing spondylitis</span>; and moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80180" conceptname="Osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</span>.<br>Suggested Dosage: <br>Indomethacin capsules 25 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. If this is well tolerated, increase the daily dosage by 25 or by 50 mg, if required by continuing symptoms, at weekly intervals until a satisfactory response is obtained or until a total daily dose of 150-200 mg is reached. DOSES ABOVE THIS AMOUNT GENERALLY DO NOT INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DRUG. <br>In patients who have persistent night <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> and/or morning <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4060220" conceptname="Stiff neck">stiffness</span>, the giving of a large portion, up to a maximum of 100 mg, of the total daily dose at bedtime, either orally or by rectal suppositories, may be helpful in affording relief. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mg. In acute flares of chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span>, it may be necessary to increase the dosage by 25 mg or, if required, by 50 mg daily. <br>If minor adverse effects develop as the dosage is increased, reduce the dosage rapidly to a tolerated dose and OBSERVE THE PATIENT CLOSELY. <br>If severe adverse reactions occur, STOP THE DRUG. After the acute phase of the disease is under control, an attempt to reduce the daily dose should be made repeatedly until the patient is receiving the smallest effective dose or the drug is discontinued. <br>Careful instructions to, and observations of, the individual patient are essential to the prevention of serious, irreversible, including fatal, adverse reactions. <br>As advancing years appear to increase the possibility of adverse reactions, indomethacin should be used with greater care in the elderly (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID_4CB08B9C-E2D8-7B32-D824-2871AD8CDD3E">PRECAUTIONS</a>, Geriatric Use</span>).<br><br>2. Acute painful shoulder (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134453" conceptname="Bursitis">bursitis</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77081" conceptname="Tibialis tendinitis">tendonitis</span>).<br>Initial Dose: <br>75-150 mg daily in 3 or 4 divided doses. <br>The drug should be discontinued after the signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> have been controlled for several days. The usual course of therapy is 7-14 days.<br><br>3. Acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="74892" conceptname="Articular gout">gouty arthritis</span>.<br>Suggested Dosage:<br>Indomethacin capsules 50 mg t.i.d. until <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> is tolerable. The dose should then be rapidly reduced to complete cessation of the drug. Definite relief of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> has been reported within 2 to 4 hours. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4082445" conceptname="Tenderness">Tenderness</span> and heat usually subside in 24 to 36 hours, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span> gradually disappears in 3 to 5 days.</p>
