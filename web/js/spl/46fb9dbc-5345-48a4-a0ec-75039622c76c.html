<h1>1     INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">VIRAMUNE is indicated for use in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>. This indication is based on one principal clinical trial (BI 1090) that demonstrated prolonged suppression of HIV-1 RNA and two smaller supportive studies, one of which (BI 1046) is described below.</p>

<p> 									VIRAMUNE suspension should be shaken gently prior to administration. It is important to administer the entire measured dose of suspension by using an oral dosing syringe or dosing cup. An oral dosing syringe is recommended, particularly for volumes of 5 mL or less. If a dosing cup is used, it should be thoroughly rinsed with water and the rinse should also be administered to the patient. 								</p>

<h2>2.3   Monitoring of Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring, including liver enzyme tests, is essential at baseline and during the first 18 weeks of treatment with VIRAMUNE. The optimal frequency of monitoring during this period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month, and in particular, would include monitoring of liver enzyme tests at baseline, prior to dose escalation, and at two weeks post-dose escalation. After the initial 18-week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout VIRAMUNE treatment [<span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">see Warnings and Precautions <a href="#Section_5">(5)</a></span></span>].

<p> 									If patients present with a suspected VIRAMUNE-associated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>, transaminases should be measured immediately.  Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>-associated transaminase elevations should be permanently discontinued from VIRAMUNE [<span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">see Warnings and Precautions <a href="#Section_5.1">(5.1)</a></span></span>]. 								</p>
<p> 									Therapy with VIRAMUNE must be initiated with a 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg/day (150 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day in pediatric patients), which has been shown to reduce the frequency of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>.

Patients should be monitored closely if isolated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> of any severity occurs.  Delay in stopping VIRAMUNE treatment after the onset of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> may result in a more serious reaction. 								</p>
<p>Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> with VIRAMUNE.</p>
<p>In a clinical trial, concomitant prednisone use (40 mg/day for the first 14 days of VIRAMUNE administration) was associated with an increase in incidence and severity of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> during the first 6 weeks of VIRAMUNE therapy.

<h2>5.3   Resistance</h2>
<p class="First">VIRAMUNE must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV-1 or added on as a sole agent to a failing regimen.  Resistant virus emerges rapidly when nevirapine is administered as monotherapy.  The choice of new antiretroviral agents to be used in combination with nevirapine should take into consideration the potential for cross resistance.  When discontinuing an antiretroviral regimen containing VIRAMUNE, the long half-life of nevirapine should be taken into account; if antiretrovirals with shorter half-lives than VIRAMUNE are stopped concurrently, low plasma concentrations of nevirapine alone may persist for a week or longer and virus resistance may subsequently develop [<span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">see Clinical Pharmacology <a href="#Section_12.4">(12.4)</a></span></span>].</p>

<p style="border-left:1px solid;"><span class="XmChange"> 									Concomitant use of St. John's wort (<span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Hypericum perforatum</span></span>) or St. John's wort-containing products and VIRAMUNE is not recommended. Co-administration of St. John’s wort with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including VIRAMUNE, is expected to substantially decrease NNRTI concentrations and may result in sub-optimal levels of VIRAMUNE and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to VIRAMUNE or to the class of NNRTIs.  Co-administration of VIRAMUNE and efavirenz is not recommended as this combination has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions and no improvement in efficacy. 								</span></p>

<h2>6.2   Clinical Trials in Pediatric Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Adverse events were assessed in BI Trial 1100.1032 (ACTG 245), a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of VIRAMUNE (n=305) in which pediatric patients received combination treatment with VIRAMUNE. In this trial two patients were reported to experience <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="141651" conceptname="Stevens-Johnson syndrome">Stevens-Johnson syndrome</span> or Stevens-Johnson/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443754" conceptname="Lyell's toxic epidermal necrolysis, subepidermal type">toxic epidermal necrolysis</span> transition syndrome.  Safety was also assessed in trial BI 1100.882 (ACTG 180), an open-label trial of VIRAMUNE (n=37) in which patients were followed for a mean duration of 33.9 months (range: 6.8 months to 5.3 years, including long-term follow-up in 29 of these patients in trial BI 1100.892). The most frequently reported adverse events related to VIRAMUNE in pediatric patients were similar to those observed in adults, with the exception of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218497" conceptname="Granulocytopenic disorder">granulocytopenia</span>, which was more commonly observed in children receiving both zidovudine and VIRAMUNE.  Cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergic reaction</span>, including one case of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylaxis</span>, were also reported.</p>
<p>The safety of VIRAMUNE was also examined in BI Trial 1100.1368, an open-label, randomized clinical study performed in South Africa in which 123 HIV-1 infected treatment-naïve patients between 3 months and 16 years of age received combination treatment with VIRAMUNE oral suspension, lamivudine and zidovudine for 48 weeks [<span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">see Use In Specific Populations <a href="#Section_8.4">(8.4)</a> and Clinical Pharmacology <a href="#Section_12.3">(12.3)</a></span></span>]. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">Rash</span> (all causality) was reported in 21% of the patients, 4 (3%) of whom discontinued drug due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>. All 4 patients experienced the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> early in the course of therapy (&lt;4 weeks) and resolved upon nevirapine discontinuation. Other clinically important adverse events (all causality) include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span> (8.9%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span> (7.3%) and hepatotoxicity (2.4%) [<span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">see Use in Specific Populations <a href="#Section_8.4">(8.4)</a> and Clinical Studies <a href="#Section_14.2">(14.2)</a></span></span>].</p>
<p>Safety information on use of VIRAMUNE in combination therapy in pediatric patients 2 weeks to &lt;3 months of age was assessed in 36 patients from the BI 1100.1222 (PACTG 356) study. No unexpected safety findings were observed although <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218497" conceptname="Granulocytopenic disorder">granulocytopenia</span> was reported more frequently in this age group compared to the older pediatric age groups and adults.</p>

<h1>7   DRUG INTERACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Nevirapine is principally metabolized by the liver via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, 3A and 2B6.  Nevirapine is known to be an inducer of these enzymes.  As a result, drugs that are metabolized by these enzyme systems may have lower than expected plasma levels when co-administered with nevirapine.</p>
<p>The specific pharmacokinetic changes that occur with co-administration of nevirapine and other drugs are listed in <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Clinical Pharmacology</span></span>, Table 5.  Clinical comments about possible dosage modifications based on established drug interactions are listed in Table 4.  The data in Tables 4 and 5 are based on the results of drug interaction studies conducted in HIV-1 seropositive subjects unless otherwise indicated.  In addition to established drug interactions, there may be potential <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interactions</span> between nevirapine and other drug classes that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system.  These potential drug interactions are also listed in Table 4.  Although specific drug interaction studies in HIV-1 seropositive subjects have not been conducted for some classes of drugs listed in Table 4, additional clinical monitoring may be warranted when co-administering these drugs.</p>
<p>The <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">in vitro</span></span> interaction between nevirapine and the antithrombotic agent warfarin is complex.  As a result, when giving these drugs concomitantly, plasma warfarin levels may change with the potential for increases in coagulation time.  When warfarin is co-administered with nevirapine, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Underline"><span class="Emphasis">Absorption and Bioavailability</span></span></p>
<p>Nevirapine is readily absorbed (&gt;90%) after oral administration in healthy volunteers and in adults with HIV-1 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>. Absolute bioavailability in 12 healthy adults following single-dose administration was 93 ± 9% (mean ± SD) for a 50 mg tablet and 91 ± 8% for an oral solution. Peak plasma nevirapine concentrations of 2 ± 0.4 μg/mL (7.5 μM) were attained by 4 hours following a single 200 mg dose. Following multiple doses, nevirapine peak concentrations appear to increase linearly in the dose range of 200 to 400 mg/day. Steady-state trough nevirapine concentrations of 4.5 ± 1.9 μg/mL (17 ± 7 μM), (n = 242) were attained at 400 mg/day. Nevirapine tablets and suspension have been shown to be comparably bioavailable and interchangeable at doses up to 200 mg. When VIRAMUNE (200 mg) was administered to 24 healthy adults (12 female, 12 male), with either a high-fat breakfast (857 kcal, 50 g fat, 53% of calories from fat) or antacid (Maalox<span class="Sup">®</span> 30 mL), the extent of nevirapine absorption (AUC) was comparable to that observed under fasting conditions. In a separate study in HIV-1 infected patients (n=6), nevirapine steady-state systemic exposure (AUC<span class="Sub">τ</span>) was not significantly altered by didanosine, which is formulated with an alkaline buffering agent. VIRAMUNE may be administered with or without food, antacid or didanosine.</p>

<h2></h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Underline"><span class="Emphasis">Distribution</span></span></p>
<p>Nevirapine is highly lipophilic and is essentially nonionized at physiologic pH. Following intravenous administration to healthy adults, the apparent volume of distribution (Vdss) of nevirapine was 1.21 ± 0.09 L/kg, suggesting that nevirapine is widely distributed in humans. Nevirapine readily crosses the placenta and is also found in breast milk [<span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">see Use In Specific Populations <a href="#Section_8.3">(8.3)</a></span></span>]. Nevirapine is about 60% bound to plasma proteins in the plasma concentration range of 1-10 μg/mL. Nevirapine concentrations in human cerebrospinal fluid (n=6) were 45% (±5%) of the concentrations in plasma; this ratio is approximately equal to the fraction not bound to plasma protein.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Underline"><span class="Emphasis">Metabolism/Elimination</span></span></p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">In vivo</span></span> studies in humans and <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">in vitro</span></span> studies with human liver microsomes have shown that nevirapine is extensively biotransformed via cytochrome P450 (oxidative) metabolism to several hydroxylated metabolites. <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">In vitro</span></span> studies with human liver microsomes suggest that oxidative metabolism of nevirapine is mediated primarily by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes from the CYP3A and CYP2B6 families, although other isozymes may have a secondary role. In a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> balance/excretion study in eight healthy male volunteers dosed to steady state with nevirapine 200 mg given twice daily followed by a single 50 mg dose of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-nevirapine, approximately 91.4 ± 10.5% of the radiolabeled dose was recovered, with urine (81.3 ± 11.1%) representing the primary route of excretion compared to feces (10.1 ± 1.5%). Greater than 80% of the radioactivity in urine was made up of glucuronide conjugates of hydroxylated metabolites. Thus cytochrome P450 metabolism, glucuronide conjugation, and urinary excretion of glucuronidated metabolites represent the primary route of nevirapine biotransformation and elimination in humans. Only a small fraction (&lt;5%) of the radioactivity in urine (representing &lt;3% of the total dose) was made up of parent compound; therefore, renal excretion plays a minor role in elimination of the parent compound.</p>
<p>Nevirapine is an inducer of hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolic enzymes 3A and 2B6.  Nevirapine induces CYP3A and CYP2B6 by approximately 20-25%, as indicated by erythromycin breath test results and urine metabolites. Autoinduction of CYP3A and CYP2B6 mediated metabolism leads to an approximately 1.5- to 2-fold increase in the apparent oral clearance of nevirapine as treatment continues from a single dose to two-to-four weeks of dosing with 200-400 mg/day. Autoinduction also results in a corresponding decrease in the terminal phase half-life of nevirapine in plasma, from approximately 45 hours (single dose) to approximately 25-30 hours following multiple dosing with 200-400 mg/day.</p>

<p>Pharmacokinetic data for nevirapine have been derived from two sources: a 48-week pediatric trial in South Africa (BI Trial 1100.1368) involving 123 HIV-1 positive, antiretroviral-naïve patients aged 3 months to 16 years; and a consolidated analysis of five Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) protocols comprising 495 patients aged 14 days to 19 years.</p>
<p>BI Trial 1100.1368 studied the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of a weight-based and a body surface area (BSA)-based dosing regimen of nevirapine. In the weight-based regimen, pediatric patients up to 8 years of age received a dose of 4 mg/kg once daily for two weeks followed by 7 mg/kg twice daily thereafter.  Patients 8 years and older were dosed 4 mg/kg once daily for two weeks followed by 4 mg/kg twice daily thereafter. In the BSA regimen, all pediatric patients received 150 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> once daily for two weeks followed by 150 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> twice daily thereafter [<span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">see Use In Specific Populations <a href="#Section_8.4">(8.4)</a> and Adverse Reactions <a href="#Section_6.2">(6.2)</a></span></span>]. Dosing of nevirapine at 150 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> BID (after a two-week lead-in of 150 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> QD) produced geometric mean or mean trough nevirapine concentrations between 4-6 μg/mL (as targeted from adult data).

<p>The consolidated analysis of Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) protocols 245, 356, 366, 377, and 403 allowed for the evaluation of pediatric patients less than 3 months of age (n=17).

<p>Nevirapine induces hepatic cytochrome P450 metabolic isoenzymes 3A and 2B6. Co-administration of VIRAMUNE and drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A or CYP2B6 may result in decreased plasma concentrations of these drugs and attenuate their therapeutic effects.</p>
<p>While primarily an inducer of cytochrome P450 3A and 2B6 enzymes, nevirapine may also inhibit this system.  Among human hepatic cytochrome P450s, nevirapine was capable <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">in vitro</span></span> of inhibiting the 10-hydroxylation of (R)-warfarin (CYP3A).  The estimated K<span class="Sub">i</span> for the inhibition of CYP3A was 270 μM, a concentration that is unlikely to be achieved in patients as the therapeutic range is &lt;25 μM.  Therefore, nevirapine may have minimal inhibitory effect on other substrates of CYP3A.</p>
<p>Nevirapine does not appear to affect the plasma concentrations of drugs that are substrates of other CYP450 enzyme systems, such as 1A2, 2D6, 2A6, 2E1, 2C9 or 2C19.</p>

<p>Because of the design of the drug interaction trials (addition of 28 days of VIRAMUNE therapy to existing HIV-1 therapy), the effect of the concomitant drug on plasma nevirapine steady-state concentrations was estimated by comparison to historical controls.</p>
<p>Administration of rifampin had a clinically significant effect on nevirapine pharmacokinetics, decreasing AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> by greater than 50%. Administration of fluconazole resulted in an approximate 100% increase in nevirapine exposure, based on a comparison to historic data [<span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">see Drug Interactions <a href="#Section_7">(7)</a></span></span>].  The effect of other drugs listed in Table 5 on nevirapine pharmacokinetics was not significant.  No significant interaction was observed when tipranavir was co-administered with low-dose ritonavir and nevirapine.</p>

<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Nevirapine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) of HIV-1. Nevirapine binds directly to reverse transcriptase (RT) and blocks the RNA-dependent and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities by causing a disruption of the enzyme's catalytic site. The activity of nevirapine does not compete with template or nucleoside triphosphates. HIV-2 RT and eukaryotic DNA polymerases (such as human DNA polymerases α, β, γ, or δ) are not inhibited by nevirapine.</p>

<a name="Section_12.4.2"></a><a name="section-11.17"></a><p></p>
<h2>Antiviral Activity </h2>
<p class="First">The antiviral activity of nevirapine has been measured in a variety of cell lines including peripheral blood mononuclear cells, monocyte-derived macrophages, and lymphoblastoid cell lines.  In an assay using human embryonic kidney 293 cells, the median EC<span class="Sub">50</span> value (50% inhibitory concentration) of nevirapine was 90 nM against a panel of 2923 isolates of HIV-1 that were primarily (93%) clade B clinical isolates from the United States.  The 99<span class="Sup">th</span> percentile EC<span class="Sub">50</span> value was 470 nM in this study.  The median EC<span class="Sub">50</span> value was 63 nM (range 14-302 nM, n=29) against clinical isolates of  HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, F, G, and H, and circulating recombinant forms CRF01_AE, CRF02_AG and CRF12_BF.  Nevirapine had no antiviral activity in cell culture against group O HIV-1 isolates (n=3) or HIV-2 isolates (n=3) replicating in cord blood mononuclear cells.  Nevirapine in combination with efavirenz exhibited strong antagonistic anti-HIV-1 activity in cell culture and was additive to antagonistic with the protease inhibitor ritonavir or the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide. Nevirapine exhibited additive to synergistic anti-HIV-1 activity in combination with the protease inhibitors amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir and tipranavir, and the NRTIs abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir and zidovudine.  The anti-HIV-1 activity of nevirapine was antagonized by the anti-HBV drug adefovir and by the anti-HCV drug ribavirin in cell culture.</p>

<h2>Resistance</h2>
<p class="First">HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility (100- to 250-fold) to nevirapine emerge in cell culture.  Genotypic analysis showed mutations in the HIV-1 RT gene encoding Y181C and/or V106A substitutions depending upon the virus <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span> and cell line employed. Time to emergence of nevirapine resistance in cell culture was not altered when selection included nevirapine in combination with several other NNRTIs.</p>
<p>Phenotypic and genotypic changes in HIV-1 isolates from treatment-naïve patients receiving either nevirapine (n=24) or nevirapine and ZDV (n=14) were monitored in Phase 1 and 2 trials over 1 to ≥12 weeks.  After 1 week of nevirapine monotherapy, isolates from 3/3 patients had decreased susceptibility to nevirapine in cell culture.  One or more of the RT mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions K103N, V106A, V108I, Y181C, Y188C and G190A were detected in HIV-1 isolates from some patients as early as 2 weeks after therapy initiation.  By week eight of nevirapine monotherapy, 100% of the patients tested (n=24) had HIV-1 isolates with a &gt;100-fold decrease in susceptibility to nevirapine in cell culture compared to baseline, and had one or more of the nevirapine-associated RT resistance substitutions.  Nineteen of these patients (80%) had isolates with Y181C substitutions regardless of dose.</p>
<p>Genotypic analysis of isolates from antiretroviral-naïve patients experiencing virologic failure (n=71) receiving nevirapine once daily (n=25) or twice daily (n=46) in combination with lamivudine and stavudine (study 2NN) for 48 weeks showed that isolates from 8/25 and 23/46 patients, respectively, contained one or more of the following NNRTI resistance-associated substitutions: Y181C, K101E, G190A/S, K103N, V106A/M, V108I, Y188C/L, A98G, F227L and M230L.</p>

Nevirapine-resistant HIV-1 isolates were cross-resistant to the NNRTIs delavirdine and efavirenz.  However, nevirapine-resistant isolates were susceptible to the NRTIs ddI and ZDV. Similarly, ZDV-resistant isolates were susceptible to nevirapine in cell culture.</p>

<h2>13.1   Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Long-term carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats were carried out with nevirapine. Mice were dosed with 0, 50, 375 or 750 mg/kg/day for two years. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4301500" conceptname="Liver cell adenoma">Hepatocellular adenomas</span> and carcinomas were increased at all doses in males and at the two high doses in females. In studies in which rats were administered nevirapine at doses of 0, 3.5, 17.5 or 35 mg/kg/day for two years, an increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4301500" conceptname="Liver cell adenoma">hepatocellular adenomas</span> was seen in males at all doses and in females at the high dose. The systemic exposure (based on AUCs) at all doses in the two animal studies was lower than that measured in humans at the 200 mg BID dose. The mechanism of the carcinogenic potential is unknown. However, in genetic toxicology assays, nevirapine showed no evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic activity in a battery of <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">in vitro</span></span> and <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">in vivo</span></span> studies. These included microbial assays for gene mutation (Ames: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> and <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">E. coli</span></span>), mammalian cell gene mutation assay (CHO/HGPRT), cytogenetic assays using a Chinese hamster ovary cell line and a mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay following oral administration. Given the lack of genotoxic activity of nevirapine, the relevance to humans of hepatocellular neoplasms in nevirapine-treated mice and rats is not known. In reproductive toxicology studies, evidence of impaired fertility was seen in female rats at doses providing systemic exposure, based on AUC, approximately equivalent to that provided with the recommended clinical dose of VIRAMUNE.</p>

<p class="First">Trial BI 1090 was a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial in 2249 HIV-1 infected patients with &lt;200 CD4<span class="Sup">+</span> cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> at screening. Initiated in 1995, BI 1090 compared treatment with VIRAMUNE + lamivudine + background therapy versus lamivudine + background therapy in NNRTI-naïve patients. Treatment doses were VIRAMUNE, 200 mg daily for two weeks followed by 200 mg twice daily or placebo, and lamivudine, 150 mg twice daily. Other antiretroviral agents were given at approved doses. Initial background therapy (in addition to lamivudine) was one NRTI in 1309 patients (58%), two or more NRTIs in 771 (34%), and PIs and NRTIs in 169 (8%). The patients (median age 36.5 years, 70% Caucasian, 79% male) had advanced HIV-1 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, with a median baseline CD4<span class="Sup">+</span> cell count of 96 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> and a baseline HIV-1 RNA of 4.58 log<span class="Sub">10</span> copies/mL (38,291 copies/mL). Prior to entering the trial, 45% had previously experienced an AIDS-defining clinical event. Eighty-nine percent had antiretroviral treatment prior to entering the trial. BI 1090 was originally designed as a clinical endpoint study. Prior to unblinding the trial, the primary endpoint was changed to proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL and not previously failed at 48 weeks. Treatment response and outcomes are shown in  Table 6. </p>

<p>The change from baseline in CD4<span class="Sup">+</span> cell count through one year of therapy was significantly greater for the VIRAMUNE group compared to the placebo group for the overall study population (64 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> vs 22 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>, respectively), as well as for patients who entered the trial as treatment naïve or having received only ZDV (85 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> vs 25 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>, respectively).</p>
<p>At two years into the study, 16% of subjects on VIRAMUNE had experienced class C CDC events as compared to 21% of subjects on the control arm.</p>
<p>Trial BI 1046 (INCAS) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, three-arm trial with 151 HIV-1 infected patients with CD4<span class="Sup">+</span> cell counts of 200-600 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> at baseline.  BI 1046 compared treatment with VIRAMUNE+zidovudine+didanosine to VIRAMUNE+zidovudine and zidovudine+didanosine. Treatment doses were VIRAMUNE at 200 mg daily for two weeks followed by 200 mg twice daily or placebo, zidovudine at 200 mg three times daily, and didanosine at 125 or 200 mg twice daily (depending on body weight). The patients had mean baseline HIV-1 RNA of 4.41 log<span class="Sub">10</span> copies/mL (25,704 copies/mL) and mean baseline CD4<span class="Sup">+</span> cell count of 376 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA &lt;400 copies/mL and not previously failed at 48 weeks. The virologic responder rates at 48 weeks were 45% for patients treated with VIRAMUNE+zidovudine+didanosine, 19% for patients treated with zidovudine+didanosine, and 0% for patients treated with VIRAMUNE+zidovudine.</p>
<p>CD4<span class="Sup">+</span> cell counts in the VIRAMUNE+ZDV+ddI group increased above baseline by a mean of 139 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> at one year, significantly greater than the increase of 87 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> in the ZDV+ddI patients.

<h2>14.2   Clinical Studies in Pediatric Patients</h2>
<p class="First">The pediatric safety and efficacy of VIRAMUNE was examined in BI Trial 1100.1368, an open-label, randomized clinical study performed in South Africa in which 123 HIV-1 infected treatment-naïve patients between 3 months and 16 years of age received VIRAMUNE oral suspension for 48 weeks. Patients were divided into 4 age groups (3 months to &lt;2 years, 2 to &lt;7 years, 7 to &lt;12 years, and 12 to ≤16 years) and randomized to receive one of two VIRAMUNE doses, determined by 2 different dosing methods [body surface area (150 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) and weight-based dosing (4 or 7 mg/kg)] in combination with zidovudine and lamivudine [<span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">see Adverse Reactions <a href="#Section_6.2">(6.2)</a>, Use in Specific Populations <a href="#Section_8.4">(8.4)</a>, and Clinical Pharmacology <a href="#Section_12.3">(12.3)</a></span></span>]. The total daily dose of VIRAMUNE did not exceed 400 mg in either regimen. There were 66 patients in the body surface area (BSA) dosing group and 57 patients in the weight-based (BW) dosing group.</p>
<p>Baseline demographics included: 49% male; 81% Black and 19% Caucasian; 4% had previous exposure to ARVs.  Patients had a median baseline HIV-1 RNA of 5.45 log<span class="Sub">10</span> copies/mL and a median baseline CD4<span class="Sup">+</span> cell count of 527 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> (range 37-2279). One hundred and five (85%) completed the 48-week period while  18 (15%) discontinued prematurely. Of the patients who discontinued prematurely, 9 (7%) discontinued due to adverse reactions and 3 (2%) discontinued due to virologic failure. Overall the proportion of patients who achieved and maintained an HIV-1 RNA &lt;400 copies/mL at 48 weeks was 47% (58/123).</p>

<p>Intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring, including liver enzymes, is essential during the first 18 weeks of therapy with VIRAMUNE to detect potentially life-threatening hepatotoxicity and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089139" conceptname="Skin reaction">skin reactions</span>. However, liver disease can occur after this period; therefore, monitoring should continue at frequent intervals throughout VIRAMUNE treatment. Extra vigilance is warranted during the first 6 weeks of therapy, which is the period of greatest risk of hepatic events and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089139" conceptname="Skin reaction">skin reactions</span>.  Patients with signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> should discontinue VIRAMUNE and seek medical evaluation immediately. If VIRAMUNE is discontinued due to hepatotoxicity, do not restart it.  Patients, particularly women, with increased CD4<span class="Sup">+</span> cell count at initiation of VIRAMUNE therapy (&gt;250 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> in women and &gt;400 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> in men) are at substantially higher risk for development of symptomatic hepatic events, often associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>.  Patients should be advised that co-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> B or C and/or increased transaminases at the start of therapy with VIRAMUNE are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting VIRAMUNE) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT [<span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">see <a href="#Section_0">Boxed Warning</a> and Warnings and Precautions <a href="#Section_5.1">(5.1)</a></span></span>].</p>
<p>The majority of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rashes</span> associated with VIRAMUNE occur within the first 6 weeks of initiation of therapy.  Patients should be instructed that if any <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> occurs during the two-week lead-in period, the VIRAMUNE dose should not be escalated until the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> resolves.  The total duration of the once-daily lead-in dosing period should not exceed 28 days, at which point an alternative regimen may need to be started.  Any patient experiencing a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> should have their liver enzymes (AST, ALT) evaluated immediately.  Patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span> should discontinue VIRAMUNE immediately and consult a physician.

<h2>17.2   Administration</h2>
<p class="First">Patients should be informed to take VIRAMUNE every day as prescribed.  Patients should not alter the dose without consulting their doctor. If a dose is missed, patients should take the next dose as soon as possible. However, if a dose is skipped, the patient should not double the next dose. Patients should be advised to report to their doctor the use of any other medications.</p>
<p>Patients should be informed that VIRAMUNE therapy has not been shown to reduce the risk of transmission of HIV-1 to others through sexual contact or blood contamination. The long-term effects of VIRAMUNE are unknown at this time.</p>
<p>VIRAMUNE is not a cure for HIV-1 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>; patients may continue to experience illnesses associated with advanced HIV-1 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4247535" conceptname="Opportunistic infectious disease">opportunistic infections</span>.

<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">What is VIRAMUNE?</span></span><br>VIRAMUNE is a medicine used to treat Human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433740" conceptname="Immunodeficiency disorder">Immunodeficiency</span> Virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4267414" conceptname="AIDS">Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome</span>).  </p>
<p>VIRAMUNE is a type of anti-HIV medicine called a "non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor" (NNRTI). VIRAMUNE works by lowering the amount of HIV in your blood ("viral load"). You must take VIRAMUNE with other anti-HIV medicines. When you take VIRAMUNE with other anti-HIV medicines, VIRAMUNE can lower your viral load and increase the number of CD4<span class="Sup">+</span> cells ("T cells"). CD4<span class="Sup">+</span> cells are a type of immune helper cell in the blood. VIRAMUNE may not have these effects in every person.</p>
<p>VIRAMUNE does not cure HIV or AIDS, and it is not known if it will help you live longer with HIV.  People taking VIRAMUNE may still get <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> common in people with HIV (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4247535" conceptname="Opportunistic infectious disease">opportunistic infections</span>). It is very important that you stay under the care of your doctor. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Who should not take VIRAMUNE?</span></span><br>Tell your doctor if you have or have had liver problems.  Your doctor may tell you not to take VIRAMUNE if you have certain liver problems.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">What should I tell my doctor before taking VIRAMUNE?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Before you take VIRAMUNE, tell your doctor if you:</span></span></p>

<li>receive dialysis</li>
<li>have skin problems, such as a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span></li>
<li>are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.  It is not known if VIRAMUNE will harm your unborn baby.<br><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Pregnancy Registry:</span></span>  There is a pregnancy registry for women who take antiviral medicines during pregnancy.  The purpose of the registry is to collect information about the health of you and your baby.  Talk to your doctor about how you can take part in this registry. </li>
<li>are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed.  VIRAMUNE can pass into your breast milk and may harm your baby.  It is also recommended that HIV-positive women should not breast-feed their babies.  Do not breast-feed during treatment with VIRAMUNE.  Talk to your doctor about the best way to feed your baby.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Tell your doctor and pharmacist about all the medicines you take,</span></span> including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins and herbal supplements.  VIRAMUNE may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how VIRAMUNE works.  Especially tell your doctor if you take:</p>
<ul class="Disc">
<li>St. John’s Wort.  You should not take products containing St. John’s Wort during treatment with VIRAMUNE because it can lower the amount of VIRAMUNE in your body.  </li>
<li>efavirenz (Sustiva<span class="Sup">®</span>, Atripla<span class="Sup">®</span>).  You should not take efavirenz during treatment with VIRAMUNE.  You may have an increased chance of side effects if this is taken together with VIRAMUNE.  </li>
<li>atazanavir (Reyataz<span class="Sup">®</span>).  You should not take atazanavir during treatment with VIRAMUNE.</li>
<li>itraconazole (Sporanox<span class="Sup">®</span>).  You should not take itraconazole during treatment with VIRAMUNE.</li>
<li>ketoconazole (Nizoral<span class="Sup">®</span>).  You should not take ketoconazole during treatment with VIRAMUNE.</li>
<li>rifampin (Rifadin<span class="Sup">®</span>, Rifamate<span class="Sup">®</span>, Rifater<span class="Sup">®</span>).  You should not take rifampin during treatment with VIRAMUNE.</li>
<li>Birth control pills.  Birth control pills taken by mouth (oral contraceptives) and other hormone types of birth control may not work to prevent pregnancy if you use them during VIRAMUNE treatment.  Talk with your doctor about other types of birth control that you can use to prevent pregnancy during treatment with VIRAMUNE.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Also tell your doctor if you are taking the following drugs:</p>
<ul class="Disc">
<li>clarithromycin (Biaxin)</li>
<li>fluconazole (Diflucan)</li>
<li>methadone</li>
<li>rifabutin (Mycobutin)</li>

<p>Know the medicines you take.  Keep a list of them to show your doctor or pharmacist when you get a new medicine.  </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">How should I take VIRAMUNE? </span></span></p>
<ul class="Disc">
<li>Take VIRAMUNE exactly as your doctor tells you to take it.</li>
<li>The dose of VIRAMUNE for children is based on their size and thus may not be the same as in adults. </li>
<li>You may take VIRAMUNE with or without food. </li>
<li>If you or your child takes VIRAMUNE suspension (liquid), shake it gently before use. Use an oral dosing syringe or dosing cup to measure the right dose.  									The oral dosing syringe and dosing cup are not provided with VIRAMUNE Suspension.  								 							</li>
<li> 								After drinking the medicine, fill the dosing cup with water and drink it to make sure you get all the medicine. If the dose is less than 1 teaspoon (5 mL), use the syringe instead of the dosing cup. 							</li>
<li>Do not change your dose unless your doctor tells you to. </li>
<li>Your doctor should start you with one dose each day to lower your chance of getting a serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>.  It is important that you only take one dose of VIRAMUNE each day for the first 14 days.  </li>
<li>Call your doctor right away if you get a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">skin rash</span> during the first 14 days of VIRAMUNE treatment and do not increase your dose to 2 times a day.</li>
<li>You should never take your starting dose (200 mg one time each day) for longer than 28 days.  If after 28 days you are still receiving this starting dose because you have a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>, you and your doctor should discuss replacing VIRAMUNE with another HIV medicine.  Never increase your dose to 2 times a day if you have a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>. </li>
<li>Do not miss a dose of VIRAMUNE, because this could make HIV harder to treat. If you miss a dose of VIRAMUNE, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, do not take the missed dose, just take the next dose at your regular time. </li>
<li>If you stop taking VIRAMUNE for more than 7 days, ask your doctor how much to take before you start taking it again. You may need to start with one time each day dosing again.</li>
<li>If you take too much VIRAMUNE, call your local poison control center or emergency room right away.</li>
