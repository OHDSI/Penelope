<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">BILTRICIDE<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (praziquantel) is a trematodicide provided in tablet form for the oral treatment of schistosome <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> due to liver fluke.</p>
<p>BILTRICIDEÂ  (praziquantel) is 2-(cyclohexylcarbonyl)-1,2,3,6,7, 11b-hexahydro-4H-pyrazino [2, 1-a] isoquinolin-4-one with the molecular formula; C<span class="Sub">19</span>H<span class="Sub">24</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span>. The structural formula is as follows:</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Praziquantel induces a rapid contraction of schistosomes by a specific effect on the permeability of the cell membrane. The drug further causes vacuolization and disintegration of the schistosome tegument.</p>
<p>After oral administration BILTRICIDE is rapidly absorbed (80%), subjected to a first pass effect, metabolized and eliminated by the kidneys. Maximal serum concentration is achieved 1-3 hours after dosing. The half-life of praziquantel in serum is 0.8-1.5 hours.</p>

<h2>Special Populations</h2>
<p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of praziquantel were studied in 40 patients with <span class="Italics">Schistosoma mansoni</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> with varying degrees of hepatic dysfunction (See table1). In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436038" conceptname="Infection by Schistosoma">schistosomiasis</span>, the pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between those with normal hepatic function (Group 1) and those with mild (Child-Pugh class A) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>. However, in patients with moderate-to-severe hepatic dysfunction (Child-Pugh class B and C), praziquantel half-life, C<span class="Sub">max</span>, and AUC increased progressively with the degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>. In Child-Pugh class B, the increases in mean half-life, C<span class="Sub">max</span>, and AUC relative to Group 1 were 1.58-fold, 1.76-fold, and 3.55-fold, respectively. The corresponding increases in Child-Pugh class C patients were 2.82-fold, 4.29-fold, and 15-fold for half-life, C<span class="Sub">max</span>, and AUC.</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">BILTRICIDE is indicated for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> due to: all species of schistosoma (for example, <span class="Italics">Schistosoma mekongi, Schistosoma japonicum, Schistosoma mansoni</span> and <span class="Italics">Schistosoma hematobium</span>), and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> due to the liver flukes, <span class="Italics">Clonorchis sinensis/Opisthorchis viverrini</span> (approval of this indication was based on studies in which the two species were not differentiated).</p>

<h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h1>
<p class="First">BILTRICIDE is contraindicated in patients who previously have shown <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> to the drug or any of the excipients. Since parasite destruction within the eye may cause irreversible lesions, ocular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201511" conceptname="Taenia saginata infection">cysticercosis</span> must not be treated with this compound.</p>
<p>Concomitant administration with strong Cytochrome P450 (P450)  inducers, such as rifampin, is contraindicated since therapeutically effective blood levels of praziquantel may not be achieved (see PRECAUTIONS/Drug Interactions). In patients receiving rifampin who need immediate treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436038" conceptname="Infection by Schistosoma">schistosomiasis</span>, alternative agents for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436038" conceptname="Infection by Schistosoma">schistosomiasis</span> should be considered. However, if treatment with praziquantel is necessary, rifampin should be discontinued 4 weeks before administration of praziquantel. Treatment with rifampin can then be restarted one day after completion of praziquantel treatment (see PRECAUTIONS/<a href="#i4i_interactions_id_c1fc10a7-a6de-4ee5-8d00-8cd60dcc19b4">Drug Interactions</a>). </p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First">Therapeutically effective levels of BILTRICIDE may not be achieved when administered concomitantly with strong P450 inducers, such as rifampin (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_contraindications_id_cb8872f0-db8f-4c4e-ad55-1fe2a302e89f">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span>). </p>

<a name="i4i_precautions_general_id_3f577c82-7d4c-4cee-a5e4-49c4cf7214e5"></a><a name="section-6.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Approximately 80% of a dose of praziquantel is excreted in the kidneys, almost exclusively (&gt;99%) in the form of metabolites. Excretion might be delayed in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>, but accumulation of unchanged drug would not be expected. Therefore, dose adjustment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> is not considered necessary. Nephrotoxic effects of praziquantel or its metabolites are not known.</p>
<p>Caution should be exercised in the administration of the usual recommended dose of praziquantel to hepatosplenic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436038" conceptname="Infection by Schistosoma">schistosomiasis</span> patients with moderate to severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh class B and C). Reduced metabolism of praziquantel by the liver in these patients may lead to considerably higher and longer lasting plasma concentrations of unmetabolized praziquantel (See <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY/Special Populations</span>).</p>
<p>Minimal increases in liver enzymes have been reported in some patients.</p>
<p>Patients suffering from cardiac irregularities should be monitored during treatment.</p>
<p>As BILTRICIDE can exacerbate central nervous system pathology due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436038" conceptname="Infection by Schistosoma">schistosomiasis</span>, as a general rule this drug should not be administered to individuals reporting a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> and/or other signs of potential central nervous systems involvement such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4042856" conceptname="Fibrous nodule">subcutaneous nodules</span> suggestive of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201511" conceptname="Taenia saginata infection">cysticercosis</span>.</p>
<p>When <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436038" conceptname="Infection by Schistosoma">schistosomiasis</span> or fluke <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> is found to be associated with cerebral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201511" conceptname="Taenia saginata infection">cysticercosis</span> it is advised to hospitalize the patient for the duration of treatment.</p>
<p>Published <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> data have shown a potential lack of efficacy of praziquantel against migrating schistosomulae. Data from two observational cohort studies in patients indicate that treatment with praziquantel in the acute phase of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> may not prevent progression from asymptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> to acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436038" conceptname="Infection by Schistosoma">schistosomiasis</span> or from asymptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>/ acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436038" conceptname="Infection by Schistosoma">schistosomiasis</span> into chronic phase.</p>
<p>In addition, the use of praziquantel in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436038" conceptname="Infection by Schistosoma">schistosomiasis</span> may be associated with clinical deterioration (paradoxical reactions, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432522" conceptname="Transfusion reaction due to serum protein reaction">serum sickness</span> Jarisch-Herxheimer like reactions: sudden inflammatory immune response suspected to be caused by the release of schistosomal antigens). These reactions predominantly occur in patients treated during the acute phase of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436038" conceptname="Infection by Schistosoma">schistosomiasis</span>. They may lead to potentially life-threatening events, for example, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4256228" conceptname="Respiratory failure">respiratory failure</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372887" conceptname="Disorder of brain">encephalopathy</span>, and/or cerebral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137275" conceptname="Vasculitis">vasculitis</span>.</p>

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Patients should be warned not to drive a car and not to operate machinery on the day of BILTRICIDE treatment and the following day.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Concomitant administration of rifampin, a strong P450 inducer, with praziquantel is contraindicated and must be avoided (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_contraindications_id_cb8872f0-db8f-4c4e-ad55-1fe2a302e89f">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span>). In a crossover study with a 2-week washout period, 10 healthy subjects ingested a single 40 mg/kg dose of praziquantel following pre-treatment with oral rifampin (600 mg daily for 5 days). Plasma praziquantel concentrations were undetectable in 7 out of 10 subjects. When a single 40 mg/kg dose of praziquantel was administered to these healthy subjects two weeks after discontinuation of rifampin, the mean praziquantel AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> were 23% and 35% lower, respectively, than when praziquantel was given alone. In patients receiving rifampin, for example, as part of a combination regimen for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span>, alternative agents for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436038" conceptname="Infection by Schistosoma">schistosomiasis</span> should be considered.  However, if treatment with praziquantel is necessary, treatment with rifampin should be discontinued 4 weeks before administration of praziquantel. Treatment with rifampin can then be restarted one day after completion of praziquantel treatment.</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of other drugs that increase the activity of drug metabolizing liver enzymes (P450 inducers), for example, antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin, phenobarbital and carbamazepine), and dexamethasone, may also reduce plasma levels of praziquantel. Concomitant administration of drugs that decrease the activity of drug metabolizing liver enzymes (P 450 inhibitors), for example, cimetidine, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin may increase plasma levels of praziquantel.</p>
<p>Grapefruit juice was reported to produce a 1.6-fold increase in the C<span class="Sub">max </span>and a 1.9-fold increase in the AUC of praziquantel. However, the effect of this exposure increase on the therapeutic effect and safety of praziquantel has not been systematically evaluated.</p>

<h2>Mutagenesis, Carcinogenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Mutagenicity studies of praziquantel published in the scientific literature are inconclusive. Long term oral carcinogenicity studies in rats and golden hamsters did not reveal any carcinogenic effect at doses up to 250 mg/kg/day (about half of the human daily dose based on body surface area). Praziquantel had no effect on fertility and general reproductive performance of male and female rats when given at oral doses ranging from 30 to 300 mg/kg body weight (up to 0.65 times the human daily dose based on body surface area).</p>

<h2>Pregnancy Category B</h2>
<p class="First">Developmental toxicity studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at dose levels of 30 to 300 mg/kg body weight given repeatedly during the period of organogenesis. No harm to the fetus due to praziquantel was observed. These doses were up to 0.65 times (rats) or 1.3 times (rabbits) the highest recommended human daily dose of 75 mg/kg/day, based on body surface area. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. While animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p>

<h2>Nursing mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Praziquantel appeared in the milk of nursing women at a concentration of about 1/4 that of maternal serum although it is not known, whether a pharmacological effect is likely to occur in children. Women should not nurse on the day of BILTRICIDE treatment and during the subsequent 72 hours.</p>

<h2>Geriatric use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of praziquantel did not include a sufficient number of subjects ages 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older patients cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in these patients.</p>

<h1>HOW SUPPLIED</h1>
<p class="First">BILTRICIDEÂ  is supplied as a 600 mg white to orange tinged, film-coated, oblong tablet with three scores. The tablet is coded with â€œBAYERâ€? on one side and â€œLGâ€? on the reverse side. When broken, each of the four segments contains 150 mg of active ingredient so that the dosage can be easily adjusted to the patientâ€™s bodyweight.</p>
<p>Segments are broken off by pressing the score (notch) with thumbnails. If 1/4 of a tablet is required, this is best achieved by breaking the segment from the outer end.</p>
<p>BILTRICIDE is available in bottles of 6 tablets.</p>
