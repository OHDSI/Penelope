<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Doxercalciferol, the active ingredient in
                            Hectorol<span class="Sup">®</span>, is a synthetic vitamin D<span class="Sub">2</span>
                            analog that undergoes metabolic activation <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">in vivo</span></span> to form 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<span class="Sub">2</span>
                                (1α,25-(OH)<span class="Sub">2</span>D<span class="Sub">2</span>), a naturally
                            occurring, biologically active form of vitamin D<span class="Sub">2</span>. Hectorol
                            is available as soft gelatin capsules containing 0.5 mcg, 1 mcg or 2.5
                            mcg doxercalciferol. Each capsule also contains fractionated
                            triglyceride of coconut oil, ethanol, and butylated hydroxyanisole
                            (BHA). The capsule shells contain gelatin, glycerin and titanium
                            dioxide.  In addition, the 0.5 mcg capsule shells contain
                            yellow iron oxide and FD&amp;C Red No. 40, the 1 mcg
                            capsule shells contain FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6, and the 2.5 mcg
                            capsule shells contain yellow iron oxide. </p>
<p>Doxercalciferol is a colorless crystalline compound with a
                            calculated molecular weight of 412.66 and a molecular formula of
                                C<span class="Sub">28</span>H<span class="Sub">44</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span>. It is soluble in oils and
                            organic solvents, but is relatively insoluble in water. Chemically,
                            doxercalciferol is
                            (1α,3β,5Z,7E,22E)-9,10-secoergosta-5,7,10(19),22-tetraene-1,3-diol.

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"> Vitamin D levels in humans depend on two sources: (1) exposure
                            to the ultraviolet rays of the sun for conversion of
                            7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin to vitamin D<span class="Sub">3</span>
                            (cholecalciferol) and (2) dietary intake of either vitamin D<span class="Sub">2</span>
                            (ergocalciferol) or vitamin D<span class="Sub">3</span>. Vitamin D<span class="Sub">2</span> and
                            vitamin D<span class="Sub">3</span> must be metabolically activated in the liver and
                            the kidney before becoming fully active on target tissues. The initial
                            step in the activation process is the introduction of a hydroxyl group
                            in the side chain at C-25 by the hepatic enzyme, CYP 27 (a vitamin
                            D-25-hydroxylase). The products of this reaction are
                            25-(OH)D<span class="Sub">2</span> and 25-(OH)D<span class="Sub">3</span>, respectively. Further
                            hydroxylation of these metabolites occurs in the mitochondria of kidney
                            tissue, catalyzed by renal 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1-α-hydroxylase
                            to produce 1α,25-(OH)<span class="Sub">2</span>D<span class="Sub">2</span>, the primary
                            biologically active form of vitamin D<span class="Sub">2</span>, and
                                1α,25-(OH)<span class="Sub">2</span>D<span class="Sub">3</span> (calcitriol), the
                            biologically active form of vitamin D<span class="Sub">3</span>. </p>

<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First"> Calcitriol
                                    (1α,25-(OH)<span class="Sub">2</span>D<span class="Sub">3</span>) and
                                        1α,25-(OH)<span class="Sub">2</span>D<span class="Sub">2</span> regulate blood
                                    calcium at levels required for essential body functions.
                                    Specifically, the biologically active vitamin D metabolites
                                    control the intestinal absorption of dietary calcium, the
                                    tubular reabsorption of calcium by the kidney and, in
                                    conjunction with parathyroid hormone (PTH), the mobilization of
                                    calcium from the skeleton. They act directly on bone cells
                                    (osteoblasts) to stimulate skeletal growth, and on the
                                    parathyroid glands to suppress PTH synthesis and secretion.
                                    These functions are mediated by the interaction of these
                                    biologically active metabolites with specific receptor proteins
                                    in the various target tissues. In patients with chronic kidney
                                    disease (CKD), deficient production of biologically active
                                    vitamin D metabolites (due to lack of or insufficient
                                    25-hydroxyvitamin D-1-alpha-hydroxylase activity) leads to
                                    secondary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133729" conceptname="Hyperparathyroidism">hyperparathyroidism</span>, which contributes to the

<h2>Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</h2>
<p class="First"> Doxercalciferol is absorbed from the gastrointestinal
                                    tract and activated by CYP 27 in the liver to form
                                        1α,25-(OH)<span class="Sub">2</span>D<span class="Sub">2</span> (major
                                    metabolite) and 1α,24-dihydroxyvitamin D<span class="Sub">2</span>
                                    (minor metabolite). Activation of doxercalciferol does not
                                    require the involvement of the kidneys. </p>
<p> In healthy volunteers, peak blood levels of

                                    to 37 hours with a range of up to 96 hours. The mean elimination

<h3>Dialysis:</h3>
<p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Hectorol were
                                            evaluated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled,
                                            multicentered clinical studies (Study A and Study B) in
                                            a total of 138 patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196991" conceptname="Chronic renal impairment">chronic kidney disease</span> on
                                            hemodialysis (Stage 5 CKD). Patients in Study A were an
                                            average age of 52 years (range: 22-75), were 55%
                                            male, and were 58% African-American, 31%
                                            Caucasian, and 11% Hispanic, and had been on
                                            hemodialysis for an average of 53 months. Patients in
                                            Study B were an average of 52 years (range: 27-75), were
                                            45% male, and 99% African-American, and
                                            1% Caucasian, and had been on hemodialysis for
                                            an average of 56 months. After randomization to two
                                            groups, eligible patients underwent an 8-week washout
                                            period during which no vitamin D derivatives were
                                            administered to either group. Subsequently, all patients
                                            received Hectorol in an open-label fashion for 16 weeks
                                            followed by a double-blind period of 8 weeks during
                                            which patients received either Hectorol or placebo. The
                                            initial dose of Hectorol during the open-label phase was
                                            10 micrograms after each dialysis session (3 times
                                            weekly) for a total of 30 mcg per week. The dosage of
                                            Hectorol was adjusted as necessary by the investigator
                                            in an attempt to achieve intact parathyroid hormone
                                            (iPTH) levels within a targeted range of 150 to 300
                                            pg/mL. The maximum dosage was limited to 20 mcg after
                                            each dialysis session (60 mcg/week). If at any time
                                            during the trial iPTH fell below 150 pg/mL, Hectorol was
                                            immediately suspended and restarted at a lower dosage
                                            the following week.</p>

<p>In both studies, iPTH levels increased
                                            progressively and significantly in 65.9% of the
                                            patients during the 8-week washout (control) period
                                            during which no vitamin D derivatives were administered.
                                            In contrast, Hectorol treatment resulted in a
                                            statistically significant reduction from baseline in
                                            mean iPTH levels during the 16-week open-label treatment
                                            period in more than 93.5% of the 138 treated
                                            patients. During the double-blind period (weeks 17 to
                                            24), the reduction in mean iPTH levels was maintained in
                                            the Hectorol treatment group compared to a return to
                                            near baseline in the placebo group. </p>
<p> In the clinical trials, the values for iPTH
                                            varied widely from patient to patient and from week to

<h3>Pre-dialysis:</h3>
<p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Hectorol were
                                            evaluated in two clinical studies in 55 patients with
                                            Stage 3 or Stage 4 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196991" conceptname="Chronic renal impairment">chronic kidney disease</span>. Eighty-two
                                            percent of the patients were male, the average age was
                                            64.6 years, 51% were Caucasian, 40%
                                            African-American, and the average serum iPTH level at
                                            baseline was 194.6 pg/mL. While levels of 25-(OH)
                                            vitamin D were not evaluated at baseline, retrospective
                                            assessments of stored serum revealed that the mean
                                            ± SD serum 25-(OH) vitamin D was 18.5
                                            ± 8.1 ng/mL (range: &lt; 5 to 54 ng/mL) in
                                            the study population. </p>
<p>After randomization to two groups, eligible
                                            patients underwent an 8-week washout period during which
                                            no vitamin D derivatives were administered to either
                                            group. Subsequently, one group received Hectorol and the
                                            other placebo during a double-blind period of 24 weeks.
                                            The initial dose of Hectorol was 1 mcg per day. The
                                            dosage of Hectorol was adjusted as necessary by the
                                            investigator in order to reduce intact parathyroid
                                            hormone (iPTH) levels to a target of ≥
                                            30% below post-washout baseline. The maximum
                                            dosage was limited to 3.5 mcg per day. If at any time
                                            during the trial iPTH fell below 15 pg/mL, Hectorol was
                                            immediately suspended and restarted at a lower dosage
                                            the following week.</p>

<h3>Results:</h3>
<p class="First">Decreases in the mean plasma iPTH from baseline
                                            values were calculated using as baseline the average of
                                            the last 2 values obtained during the 8-week washout
                                            phase. In analyses of pooled data from the two studies,
                                            iPTH levels decreased from baseline by an average of
                                            101.4 pg/mL in the Hectorol group and by 4.4 pg/mL in
                                            the placebo group (p&lt;0.001). Greater reductions
                                            of iPTH with Hectorol compared to placebo were observed
                                            in each study. Twenty (74%) of 27 subjects in
                                            the Hectorol group achieved mean plasma iPTH suppression
                                            of ≥ 30% from baseline for the last
                                            four weeks of treatment, whereas two (7%) of the
                                            28 subjects treated with placebo achieved this level of
                                            iPTH suppression. In the Hectorol-treated patients, the
                                            reductions in plasma iPTH were associated with a
                                            reduction in serum bone-specific alkaline
                                        phosphatase.</p>

<h3>Dialysis:</h3>
<p class="First">In four adequate and well-controlled studies, the

                                            increased during therapy with Hectorol. The observed
                                            increases during Hectorol treatment, although occurring
                                            at a low rate, underscore the importance of regular
                                            safety monitoring of serum calcium and phosphorus levels
                                            throughout treatment. Patients with higher pre-treatment
                                            serum levels of calcium (&gt; 10.5 mg/dL) or
                                            phosphorus (&gt; 6.9 mg/dL) were more likely to
                                            experience <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435511" conceptname="Hypercalcemia">hypercalcemia</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4065502" conceptname="Hyperphosphatemia">hyperphosphatemia</span>.
                                            Therefore, Hectorol should not be given to patients with
                                            a recent history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435511" conceptname="Hypercalcemia">hypercalcemia</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4065502" conceptname="Hyperphosphatemia">hyperphosphatemia</span>,

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First"> Specific drug interaction studies have not been
                                    conducted. Cholestyramine has been reported to reduce intestinal

                                    intestinal absorption of doxercalciferol. Magnesium-containing
                                    antacids and Hectorol should not be used concomitantly because
                                    such use may lead to the development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4284559" conceptname="Hypermagnesemia">hypermagnesemia</span> (see

                                    and availability of Hectorol. Although not examined
                                    specifically, enzyme inducers (such as glutethimide and
                                    phenobarbital) may affect the 25-hydroxylation of Hectorol and
                                    may necessitate dosage adjustments. Cytochrome P450 inhibitors
                                    (such as ketoconazole and erythromycin) may inhibit the
                                    25-hydroxylation of Hectorol. Hence, formation of the active
                                    Hectorol moiety may be hindered. </p>

<h2>Treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435511" conceptname="Hypercalcemia">Hypercalcemia</span> and Overdosage</h2>
<p class="First">General treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435511" conceptname="Hypercalcemia">hypercalcemia</span> (greater than 1 mg/dL
                                    above the upper limit of the normal range in dialysis patients;
                                    &gt; 10.7 mg/dL in pre-dialysis patients) consists of
                                    immediate suspension of Hectorol therapy, institution of a low
                                    calcium diet, and withdrawal of calcium supplements. Serum
                                    calcium levels should be determined at least weekly until
                                    normocalcemia ensues. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435511" conceptname="Hypercalcemia">Hypercalcemia</span> usually resolves in 2 to 7
                                    days. When serum calcium levels have returned to within normal
                                    limits, Hectorol therapy may be reinstituted at a dose that is
                                    lower (at least 2.5 mcg in dialysis patients and 0.5 mcg in
                                    pre-dialysis patients) than prior therapy. In dialysis patients,
                                    serum calcium levels should be obtained weekly after all dosage
                                    changes and during subsequent dosage titration. Persistent or
                                    markedly elevated serum calcium levels may be corrected by

<h2>Treatment of Accidental Overdosage of Doxercalciferol</h2>
<p class="First"> The treatment of acute accidental overdosage of Hectorol
                                    should consist of general supportive measures. If drug ingestion
                                    is discovered within a relatively short time (10 minutes),
                                    induction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> or gastric lavage may be of benefit in
                                    preventing further absorption. If drug ingestion is discovered
                                    later than 10 minutes post-ingestion, the administration of
                                    mineral oil may promote its fecal elimination. Serial serum
                                    electrolyte determinations (especially calcium), rate of urinary
                                    calcium excretion, and assessment of electrocardiographic
                                    abnormalities due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435511" conceptname="Hypercalcemia">hypercalcemia</span> should be obtained. Such
                                    monitoring is critical in patients receiving digitalis.
                                    Discontinuation of supplemental calcium and institution of a low
                                    calcium diet are also indicated in accidental overdosage. If
                                    persistent and markedly elevated serum calcium levels occur,
                                    treatment with standard medical care should be followed, as
                                    needed. Based on similarities between Hectorol and its
                                    active metabolite, 1α,25-(OH)<span class="Sub">2</span>D<span class="Sub">2</span>,
                                    it is expected that Hectorol is not removed from the blood by

<h2>Dialysis:</h2>
<p class="First"> The recommended initial dose of Hectorol is 10 mcg
                                    administered three times weekly at dialysis (approximately every
                                    other day). The initial dose should be adjusted, as needed, in
                                    order to lower blood iPTH into the range of 150 to 300 pg/mL.
                                    The dose may be increased at 8-week intervals by 2.5 mcg if iPTH
                                    is not lowered by 50% and fails to reach the target
                                    range. The maximum recommended dose of Hectorol is 20 mcg
                                    administered three times a week at dialysis for a total of 60
                                    mcg per week. Drug administration should be suspended if iPTH

<p>Dosing must be individualized and based on iPTH levels

<p class="First">The recommended initial dose of Hectorol is 1 mcg
                                    administered once daily. The initial dose should be adjusted, as
                                    needed, in order to lower blood iPTH to within target ranges
                                    (see table below). The dose may be increased at 2-week intervals
                                    by 0.5 mcg to achieve the target range of iPTH. The maximum
                                    recommended dose of Hectorol is 3.5 mcg administered once per
                                    day. </p>
<p> Serum levels of calcium and phosphorus and plasma levels
                                    of iPTH should be monitored at least every two weeks for 3
