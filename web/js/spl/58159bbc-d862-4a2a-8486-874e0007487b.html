<a name="section-4"></a><p></p>Pharmacokinetics<br><br>KADIAN® capsules contain polymer coated extended-release pellets of morphine sulfate that release morphine significantly more slowly than from conventional oral preparations. KADIAN® activity is primarily due to morphine. One metabolite, morphine-6-glucuronide, has been shown to have analgesic activity, but does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.<br><br>Following oral administration of morphine, the extent of absorption is essentially the same for immediate or extended-release formulations, although the time to peak blood level (Tmax) will be longer and the Cmax will be lower for formulations that delay the release of morphine in the gastrointestinal tract.<br><br>Elimination of morphine is primarily via hepatic metabolism to glucuronide metabolites (55 to 65%) which are then renally excreted. The terminal half-life of morphine is 2 to 4 hours, however, a longer term half-life of about 15 hours has been reported in studies where blood has been sampled up to 48 hours.<br><br>The single-dose pharmacokinetics of KADIAN® are linear over the dosage range of 30 to 100 mg. The single dose and multiple dose pharmacokinetic parameters of KADIAN® in normal volunteers are summarized in Table 1.<br><br><a name="i95b9c406-20ac-44b3-856f-68c38bf3f867"></a><table border="6" width="100%">

<br><br>When given once-daily (every 24 hours) to 24 patients with malignancy, KADIAN® had a similar Cmax and higher Cmin at steady state in clinical usage, when compared to twice-daily (every 12 hours) extended-release morphine tablets, given at an equivalent total daily dosage (see Graph 2 and Table 1). Drug-disease interactions are frequently seen in the older and more gravely ill patients, and may result in both altered absorption and reduced clearance as compared to normal volunteers (see Geriatric, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">Hepatic Failure</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span> sections).<br><br>Graph 2 (Study # MOR-9/92): Dose normalized mean steady state plasma morphine concentrations for KADIAN® (once a day), and an equivalent dose of a 12-hour, extended-release morphine tablet given twice a day.  Plasma concentrations are normalized to 100 mg every 24 hours, (n=24).<br><br><div class="Figure"><img alt="Kadian Figure 03" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=58159bbc-d862-4a2a-8486-874e0007487b&amp;name=KadianFigure03.jpg"></div>Distribution<br><br>Once absorbed, morphine is distributed to skeletal muscle, kidneys, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen and brain.  The volume of distribution of morphine is approximately 3 to 4 L/kg. Morphine is 30 to 35% reversibly bound to plasma proteins.  Although the primary site of action of morphine is in the CNS, only small quantities pass the blood-brain barrier. Morphine also crosses the placental membranes (see PRECAUTIONS-Pregnancy) and has been found in breast milk (see PRECAUTIONS-Nursing Mothers).<br><br>Metabolism <br><br>The major pathway of the detoxification of morphine is conjugation, either with D-glucuronic acid in the liver to produce glucuronides or with sulfuric acid to give morphine-3-etheral sulfate.  Although a small fraction (less than 5%) of morphine is demethylated, for all practical purposes, virtually all morphine is converted to glucuronide metabolites including morphine-3-glucuronide, M3G (about 50%) and morphine-6-glucuronide, M6G (about 5 to 15%). Studies in healthy subjects and cancer patients have shown that the glucuronide metabolite to morphine mean molar ratios (based on AUC) are similar after both single doses and at steady state for KADIAN®, 12-hour extended-release morphine sulfate tablets and morphine sulfate solution.<br><br>M3G has no significant analgesic activity. M6G has been shown to have opioid agonist and analgesic activity in humans.<br><br>Excretion <br><br>Approximately 10% of morphine dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.  Most of the dose is excreted in the urine as M3G and M6G. A small amount of the glucuronide metabolites is excreted in the bile and there is some minor enterohepatic cycling.  Seven to 10% of administered morphine is excreted in the feces.<br><br>The mean adult plasma clearance is about 20-30 mL/minute/kg. The effective terminal half-life of morphine after IV administration is reported to be approximately 2.0 hours.  Longer plasma sampling in some studies suggests a longer terminal half-life of morphine of about 15 hours.<br><br>Special Populations <br><br>Geriatric <br><br>The elderly may have increased sensitivity to morphine and may achieve higher and more variable serum levels than younger patients.  In adults, the duration of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> increases progressively with age, though the degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> remains unchanged.  KADIAN® pharmacokinetics have not been investigated in elderly patients (&gt;65 years) although such patients were included in the clinical studies.<br><br>Nursing Mothers <br><br>Morphine is excreted in the maternal milk, and the milk to plasma morphine AUC ratio is about 2.5:1. The amount of morphine received by the infant depends on the maternal plasma concentration, amount of milk ingested by the infant, and the extent of first pass metabolism.<br><br>Pediatric <br><br>Infants under 1 month of age have a prolonged elimination half-life and decreased clearance relative to older infants and pediatric patients. The clearance of morphine and its elimination half-life begin to approach adult values by the second month of life.

<p class="First">Information for Patients<br><br>If clinically advisable, patients receiving KADIAN®, or their caregivers should be given the following information by the physician, nurse, or pharmacist:<br><br>1. Patients should be advised that KADIAN® contains morphine and should be taken only as directed. <br>2. Patients should be advised that KADIAN® capsules should be swallowed whole (not chewed, crushed, or dissolved). Alternately, KADIAN® capsules may be opened and the entire contents sprinkled on a small amount of apple sauce immediately prior to ingestion. KADIAN® capsules or the contents of the capsules must not be chewed or crushed due to a risk of fatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. <br>3. Patients should be advised that KADIAN® 100 mg and 200 mg Capsules are for use only in opioid-tolerant patients.  Special care must be taken to avoid accidental ingestion or use by individuals (including children) other than the patient for whom it was originally prescribed, as such unsupervised use may have severe, even fatal, consequences. <br>4. Patients should be advised that the dose of KADIAN® should not be adjusted without consulting the prescribing health care provider. <br>5. Patients should be advised to report episodes of breakthrough <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> and adverse experiences occurring during therapy.  Individualization of dosage is essential to make optimal use of this medication. <br>6. Patients should be advised that KADIAN® may impair mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks (e.g., driving, operating machinery).  Patients started on KADIAN® or whose dose has been changed should refrain from dangerous activity until it is established that they are not adversely affected. <br>7. Patients should be advised that KADIAN® should not be taken with alcohol or other CNS depressants (sleeping medication, tranquilizers) except by the orders of the prescribing healthcare provider because dangerous additive effects may occur resulting in serious injury or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. <br>8. Women of childbearing potential who become or are planning to become pregnant, should consult their prescribing healthcare provider prior to initiating or continuing therapy with KADIAN®. <br>9. Patients should be advised that if they have been receiving treatment with KADIAN® for more than a few weeks and cessation of therapy is indicated, it may be appropriate to taper the KADIAN® dose, rather than abruptly discontinue it, due to the risk of precipitating withdrawal symptoms.  Their prescribing healthcare provider should provide a dose schedule to accomplish a gradual discontinuation of the medication. <br>10. Patients should be advised that KADIAN® is a potential drug of abuse.  They should protect it from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4087298" conceptname="Theft">theft</span>, and it should never be given to anyone other than the individual for whom it was prescribed. <br>11.

<p class="First">Pregnancy <br><br>Teratogenic Effects <br></p>
<p>(Pregnancy Category C) <br><br>Teratogenic effects of morphine have been reported in the animal literature. High parental doses during the second trimester were teratogenic in neurological, soft and skeletal tissue. The abnormalities included <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372887" conceptname="Disorder of brain">encephalopathy</span> and axial skeletal fusions. These doses were often maternally toxic and were 0.3 to 3-fold the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m2 basis. The relative contribution of morphine-induced maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090739" conceptname="Nutritional disorder">malnutrition</span>, each of which can be teratogenic, has not been clearly defined. Treatment of male rats with approximately 3-fold the MRHD for 10 days prior to mating decreased litter size and viability.<br><br>Nonteratogenic Effects <br></p>
<p>Morphine given subcutaneously, at non-maternally toxic doses, to rats during the third trimester with approximately 0.15-fold the MRHD caused reversible reductions in brain and spinal cord volume, and testes size and body weight in the offspring, and decreased fertility in female offspring.  The offspring of rats and hamsters treated orally or intraperitoneally throughout pregnancy with 0.04- to 0.3-fold the MRHD of morphine have demonstrated delayed growth, motor and sexual maturation and decreased male fertility.  Chronic morphine exposure of fetal animals resulted in mild withdrawal, altered reflex and motor skill development, and altered responsiveness to morphine that persisted into adulthood.<br><br>There are no well-controlled studies of chronic in utero exposure to morphine sulfate in human subjects. However, uncontrolled retrospective studies of human neonates chronically exposed to other opioids in utero, demonstrated reduced brain volume which normalized over the first month of life.  Infants born to opioid-abusing mothers are more often <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="72726" conceptname="Light-for-dates with signs of fetal malnutrition">small for gestational age</span>, have a decreased ventilatory response to CO2 and increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435937" conceptname="Sudden infant death syndrome">sudden infant death syndrome</span>.  KADIAN® should only be used during pregnancy if the need for strong opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> justifies the potential risk to the fetus.<br><br></p>

<p class="First">Labor and Delivery<br><br>KADIAN® is not recommended for use in women during and immediately prior to labor, where shorter acting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate.  Occasionally, opioid analgesics may prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration and frequency of uterine contractions.  However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation which tends to shorten labor.  Neonates whose mothers received opioid analgesics during labor should be observed closely for signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>.  A specific opioid antagonist, such as naloxone or nalmefene, should be available for reversal of opioid-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> in the neonate.</p>
<p>Neonatal Withdrawal Syndrome <br></p>
<p>Chronic maternal use of opiates or opioids during pregnancy coexposes the fetus. The newborn may experience subsequent neonatal withdrawal syndrome (NWS).  Manifestations of NWS include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">hyperactivity</span>, abnormal sleep pattern, high-pitched cry, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span>, and failure to gain weight.  The onset, duration, and severity of the disorder differ based on such factors as the addictive drug used, time and amount of mother’s last dose, and rate of elimination of the drug from the newborn.  Approaches to the treatment of this syndrome have included supportive care and, when indicated, drugs such as paregoric or phenobarbital.<br></p>

<p class="First">Nursing Mothers <br></p>
<p>Low levels of morphine sulfate have been detected in human milk.  Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breast-feeding infants when maternal administration of morphine sulfate is stopped.  Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from KADIAN®, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.<br></p>

<p class="First">Pediatric Use <br></p>
<p>The safety of KADIAN®, both the entire capsule and the pellets sprinkled on apple sauce, have not been directly investigated in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years.  The range of doses available is not suitable for the treatment of very young pediatric patients or those who are not old enough to take capsules safely.  The apple sauce sprinkling method is not an appropriate alternative for these patients.<br></p>

<p class="First">Geriatric Use <br></p>
<p>Clinical studies of KADIAN® did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.<br><br></p>

<p class="First">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION <br></p>
<p>KADIAN® may be administered once or twice daily.<br><br>KADIAN® capsules should be swallowed whole.  The pellets in KADIAN® capsules should not be chewed, crushed, or dissolved due to the risk of rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of morphine. <br><br>Alternatively, KADIAN® capsules may be administered as a sprinkle on apple sauce or through a 16 French gastrostomy tube (see ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF ADMINISTRATION section).<br><br>The 100 mg and 200 mg capsules are for use only in opioid-tolerant patients.  <br><br>KADIAN® is not indicated for pre-emptive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> (administration pre-operatively for the management of post-operative <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>), or for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> in the immediate post-operative period (the first 12 to 24 hours following surgery) for patients not previously taking the drug, because its safety in these settings have not been established. <br><br>KADIAN® is only indicated for post-operative use if the patient is already receiving the drug prior to surgery or if the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439502" conceptname="Postoperative pain">postoperative pain</span> is expected to be moderate to severe and persist for an extended period of time.  <br><br>Patients who are already receiving KADIAN® Capsules as part of ongoing analgesic therapy may be safely continued on the drug if appropriate dosage adjustments are made considering the procedure, other drugs given, and the temporary changes in physiology caused by the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4121697" conceptname="Surgery">surgical intervention</span>.<br><br>Initiating Therapy with KADIAN® Capsules <br></p>
<p>Physicians should individualize treatment using a progressive plan of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> management such as outlined by the World Health Organization, the American <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">Pain</span> Society and the Federation of State Medical Boards Model Guidelines.  Health care professionals should follow appropriate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> management principles of careful assessment and ongoing monitoring.<br><br>It is critical to adjust the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's prior analgesic treatment experience.  In the selection of the initial dose of KADIAN®, attention should be given to:<br>1. the total daily dose, potency and kind of opioid the patient has been taking previously; <br>2. the reliability of the relative potency estimate used to calculate the equivalent dose of morphine needed (Note: potency estimates may vary with the route of administration); <br>3. the patient's degree of opioid experience and opioid tolerance; <br>4. the general condition and medical status of the patient; <br>5. concurrent medication; <br>6. the type and severity of the patient's <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>. <br></p>
<p>Care should be taken to use low initial doses of KADIAN® in patients who are not already opioid-tolerant, especially those who are receiving concurrent treatment with muscle relaxants, sedatives, or other CNS active medications (see PRECAUTIONS).<br><br>During periods of changing analgesic requirements including initial titration, frequent communication is recommended between physician, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family.<br><br>The following dosing recommendations, therefore, can only be considered suggested approaches to what is actually a series of clinical decisions over time in the management of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> of an individual patient.<br><br>Conversion from Other Oral Morphine Formulations to KADIAN® <br></p>
<p>Patients on other oral morphine formulations may be converted to KADIAN® by administering one-half of the patient's total daily oral morphine dose as KADIAN® capsules every 12 hours (twice-a-day) or by administering the total daily oral morphine dose as KADIAN® capsules every 24 hours (once-a-day). KADIAN® should not be given more frequently than every 12 hours.<br><br>Conversion from Parenteral Morphine or Other Parenteral or Oral Opioids to KADIAN® <br></p>
<p>KADIAN® can be administered to patients previously receiving treatment with parenteral morphine or other opioids.  While there are useful tables of oral and parenteral equivalents in cancer <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, there is substantial interpatient variation in the relative potency of different opioid drugs and formulations.  For these reasons, it is better to underestimate the patient's 24-hour oral morphine requirement and provide rescue medication, than to overestimate and manage an adverse event. The following general points should be considered:<br><br>1. Parenteral to Oral Morphine Ratio:  It may take anywhere from 2-6 mg of oral morphine to provide <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> equivalent to 1 mg of parenteral morphine.  A dose of oral morphine three times the daily parenteral morphine requirement may be sufficient in chronic use settings. <br>2. Other Parenteral or Oral Opioids to Oral Morphine Sulfate:  There is lack of systematic evidence bearing on these types of analgesic substitutions.  Therefore, specific recommendations are not possible.  Physicians are advised to refer to published relative potency data, keeping in mind that such ratios are only approximate.  In general, it is safest to give half of the estimated daily morphine demand as the initial dose, and to manage <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012238" conceptname="Inadequate analgesia">inadequate analgesia</span> by supplementation with immediate-release morphine. (See discussion which follows.) <br></p>
<p>The first dose of KADIAN® may be taken with the last dose of any immediate-release (short-acting) opioid medication due to the long delay until the peak effect after administration of KADIAN®.<br><br>Use of KADIAN® as the First Opioid Analgesic <br>There has been no evaluation of KADIAN® as an initial opioid analgesic in the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>. Because it may be more difficult to titrate a patient to adequate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> using an extended-release morphine, it is ordinarily advisable to begin treatment using an immediate-release morphine formulation.<br><br>Individualization of Dosage <br>The best use of opioid analgesics in the management of chronic malignant and non-malignant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> is challenging, and is well described in materials published by the World Health Organization and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research which are available from Alpharma Pharmaceuticals LLC upon request.  KADIAN® is a third step drug which is most useful when the patient requires a constant level of opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> as a "floor" or "platform" from which to manage breakthrough <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>.  When a patient has reached the point where comfort cannot be provided with a combination of non-opioid medications (NSAIDs and acetaminophen) and intermittent use of moderate or strong opioids, the patient's total opioid therapy should be converted into a 24 hour oral morphine equivalent.<br><br>KADIAN® should be started by administering one-half of the estimated total daily oral morphine dose every 12 hours (twice-a-day) or by administering the total daily oral morphine dose every 24 hours (once-a-day).  The dose should be titrated no more frequently than every-other-day to allow the patients to stabilize before escalating the dose.  If breakthrough <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> occurs, the dose may be supplemented with a small dose (less than 20% of the total daily dose) of a short-acting analgesic. Patients who are excessively sedated after a once-a-day dose or who regularly experience <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012238" conceptname="Inadequate analgesia">inadequate analgesia</span> before the next dose should be switched to twice-a-day dosing.<br><br>Patients who do not have a proven tolerance to opioids should be started only on the 10 mg or 20 mg strength, and usually should be increased at a rate not greater than 20 mg every-other-day.  Most patients will rapidly develop some degree of tolerance, requiring dosage adjustment until they have achieved their individual best balance between baseline <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> and opioid side effects such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, sedation and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">constipation</span>.  No guidance can be given as to the recommended maximal dose, especially in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436096" conceptname="Chronic pain">chronic pain</span> of malignancy. In such cases the total dose of KADIAN® should be advanced until the desired therapeutic endpoint is reached or clinically significant opioid-related adverse reactions intervene.<br><br>Alternative Methods of Administration <br></p>
<p>In a study of healthy volunteers, KADIAN® pellets sprinkled over apple sauce were found to be bioequivalent to KADIAN® capsules swallowed whole with apple sauce under fasting conditions. Other foods have not been tested.  Patients who have difficulty swallowing whole capsules or tablets may benefit from this alternative method of administration.<br><br>1.Sprinkle the pellets onto a small amount of apple sauce. Apple sauce should be room temperature or cooler. <br>2. The patient must be cautioned not to chew the pellets which could result in the immediate release of a potentially dangerous, even fatal dose of morphine. <br>3. Use immediately. <br>4. Rinse mouth to ensure all pellets have been swallowed. 5. Patients should consume entire portion and should not divide apple sauce into separate doses.<br><br>The entire capsule contents may alternatively be administered through a 16 French gastrostomy tube.<br><br>1. Flush the gastrostomy tube with water to ensure that it is wet. <br>2. Sprinkle the KADIAN® Pellets into 10 mL of water. <br>3. Use a swirling motion to pour the pellets and water into the gastrostomy tube through a funnel. <br>4. Rinse the beaker with a further 10 mL of water and pour this into the funnel. <br>5. Repeat rinsing until no pellets remain in the beaker. <br></p>
<p>THE ADMINISTRATION OF KADIAN® PELLETS THROUGH A NASOGASTRIC TUBE SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED. <br><br>Considerations in the Adjustment of Dosing Regimens <br></p>
<p>If signs of excessive opioid effects are observed early in the dosing interval, the next dose should be reduced.  If this adjustment leads to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012238" conceptname="Inadequate analgesia">inadequate analgesia</span>, that is, if breakthrough <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> occurs when KADIAN® is administered on an every 24 hours dosing regimen, consideration should be given to dosing every 12 hours.  If breakthrough <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> occurs on a 12 hour dosing regimen a supplemental dose of a short-acting analgesic may be given.  As experience is gained, adjustments in both dose and dosing interval can be made to obtain an appropriate balance between <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relief and opioid side effects.  To avoid accumulation the dosing interval of KADIAN® should not be reduced below 12 hours.<br><br>Cessation of Therapy<br><br>When the patient no longer requires therapy with KADIAN® capsules, doses should be tapered gradually to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the physically dependent patient. <br><br>Conversion from KADIAN® to Other Extended-Release Oral Morphine Formulations <br></p>
<p>KADIAN® is not bioequivalent to other extended-release morphine preparations.  Although for a given dose the same total amount of morphine is available from KADIAN® as from morphine solution or extended-release morphine tablets, the slower release of morphine from KADIAN® results in reduced maximum and increased minimum plasma morphine concentrations than with shorter acting morphine products.  Conversion from KADIAN® to the same total daily dose of extended-release morphine preparations may lead to either excessive sedation at peak or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012238" conceptname="Inadequate analgesia">inadequate analgesia</span> at trough and close observation and appropriate dosage adjustments are recommended.<br><br>Conversion from KADIAN® to Parenteral Opioids <br></p>
<p>When converting a patient from KADIAN® to parenteral opioids, it is best to calculate an equivalent parenteral dose, and then initiate treatment at half of this calculated value.  For example, to estimate the required 24 hour dose of parenteral morphine for a patient taking KADIAN®, one would take the 24 hour KADIAN® dose, divide by an oral to parenteral conversion ratio of 3, divide the estimated 24 hour parenteral dose into six divided doses (for a four hour dosing interval), then halve this dose as an initial trial. <br><br>For example, to estimate the required parenteral morphine dose for a patient taking 360 mg of KADIAN® a day, divide the 360 mg daily oral morphine dose by a conversion ratio of 1 mg of parenteral morphine for every 3 mg of oral morphine.  The estimated 120 mg daily parenteral requirement is then divided into six 20 mg doses, and half of this, or 10 mg, is then given every 4 hours as an initial trial dose.<br><br>This approach is likely to require a dosage increase in the first 24 hours for many patients, but is recommended because it is less likely to cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> than trying to establish an equivalent dose without titration.<br></p>
