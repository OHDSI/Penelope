<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Sensorcaine<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (bupivacaine HCl) injections are sterile isotonic solutions that contain a local anesthetic agent with and without epinephrine (as bitartrate) 1:200,000 and are administered parenterally by injection. Â See <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><a href="#b928833d-01a7-4779-8eaf-3a8a924a09b7">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</a></span></span>Â  for specific uses. Â Solutions of bupivacaine HCl maybe autoclaved if they do not contain epinephrine.</p>
<p>Sensorcaine injections contain bupivacaine HCl which is chemically designated as 2-piperidinecarboxamide, 1-butyl-<span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">N</span></span>-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-, monohydrochloride, monohydrate and has the following structure:</p>
<p><img alt="structure" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=eb6d8fee-def4-4c96-9972-695e8cea8ea8&amp;name=sensorcaine-figure-1-sensorcaine-bupivacaine-hcl-figure-1-sen-stru-1.jpg"></p>
<br><p>Epinephrine is (-)-3,4-Dihydroxy-Î±[(methylamino)methyl] benzyl alcohol. Â It has the following structural formula:</p>
<br><p><img alt="structure" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=eb6d8fee-def4-4c96-9972-695e8cea8ea8&amp;name=sensorcaine-figure-2-sensorcaine-bupivacaine-hcl-figure-2-sen-stru-2.jpg"></p>
<br><p>The pK<span class="Sub">a </span>of bupivacaine (8.1) is similar to that of lidocaine(7.86).Â  However, bupivacaine possesses a greater degree of lipid solubility and is protein bound to a greater extent than lidocaine.</p>
<p>Bupivacaine is related chemically and pharmacologically to the aminoacyl local anesthetics. Â It is a homologue of mepivacaine and is chemically related to lidocaine. Â All three of these anesthetics contain an amide linkage between the aromatic nucleus and the amino, or piperidine group. Â They differ in this respect from the procaine-type local anesthetics, which have an ester linkage.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Local anesthetics block the generation and the conduction of nerve impulses, presumably by increasing the threshold for electrical excitation in the nerve, by slowing the propagation of the nerve impulse, and by reducing the rate of rise of the action potential.Â  In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination, and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers.Â  Clinically, the order of loss of nerve function is as follows: (1) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, (2) temperature, (3) touch, (4) proprioception, and (5) skeletal muscle tone.</p>
<p>Systemic absorption of local anesthetics produces effects on the cardiovascular and central nervous systems (CNS).Â  At blood concentrations achieved with normal therapeutic doses, changes in cardiac conduction, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">excitability</span>, refractoriness, contractility, and peripheral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span> are minimal.Â  However, toxic blood concentrations depress cardiac conduction and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">excitability</span>, which may lead to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316135" conceptname="Atrioventricular block">atrioventricular block</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span>, sometimes resulting in fatalities.Â  In addition, myocardial contractility is depressed and peripheral vasodilation occurs, leading to decreased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span> and arterial blood pressure.Â  Recent clinical reports and animal research suggest that these cardiovascular changes are more likely to occur after unintended intravascular injection of bupivacaine.Â  Therefore, incremental dosing is necessary.</p>
<p>Following systemic absorption, local anesthetics can produce central nervous system stimulation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, or both.Â Apparent central stimulation is manifested as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">restlessness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremors</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4190045" conceptname="Rigor">shivering</span> progressing to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>, followed by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span> progressing ultimately to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317109" conceptname="Respiratory arrest">respiratory arrest</span>.Â However, the local anesthetics have a primary depressant effect on the medulla and on higher centers.Â  The depressed stage may occur without a prior excited state.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">The rate of systemic absorption of local anesthetics is dependent upon the total dose and concentration of drug administered, the route of administration, the vascularity of the administration site, and the presence or absence of epinephrine in the anesthetic solution.Â  A dilute concentration of epinephrine (1:200,000 or 5 mcg/mL) usually reduces the rate of absorption and peak plasma concentration of bupivacaine, permitting the use of moderately larger total doses and sometimes prolonging the duration of action. </p>
<p>The onset of action with bupivacaine is rapid and anesthesia is long lasting.Â  The duration of anesthesia is significantly longer with bupivacaine than with any other commonly used local anesthetic.Â  It has also been noted that there is a period of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> that persists after the return of sensation, during which time the need for strong analgesics is reduced.</p>
<p>The onset of action following dental injections is usually 2 to 10 minutes and anesthesia may last two or three times longer than lidocaine and mepivacaine for dental use, in many patients up to 7 hours.Â  The duration of anesthetic effect is prolonged by the addition of epinephrine 1:200,000.</p>
<p>Local anesthetics are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees.Â  Generally, the lower the plasma concentration of drug the higher the percentage of drug bound to plasma proteins.</p>
<p>Local anesthetics appear to cross the placenta by passive diffusion.Â  The rate and degree of diffusion is governed by (1) the degree of plasma protein binding, (2) the degree of ionization, and (3) the degree of lipid solubility.Â  Fetal/maternal ratios of local anesthetics appear to be inversely related to the degree of plasma protein binding, because only the free, unbound drug is available for placental transfer.Â  Bupivacaine with a high protein binding capacity (95%) has a low fetal/maternal ratio (0.2 to 0.4).Â  The extent of placental transfer is also determined by the degree of ionization and lipid solubility of the drug.Â  Lipid soluble, nonionized drugs readily enter the fetal blood from the maternal circulation.</p>
<p>Depending upon the route of administration, local anesthetics are distributed to some extent to all body tissues, with high concentrations found in highly perfused organs such as the liver, lungs, heart, and brain.</p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic studies on the plasma profile of bupivacaine after direct intravenous injection suggest a three-compartment open model.Â  The first compartment is represented by the rapid intravascular distribution of the drug.Â  The second compartment represents the equilibration of the drug throughout the highly perfused organs such as the brain, myocardium, lungs, kidneys, and liver.Â  The third compartment represents an equilibration of the drug with poorly perfused tissues, such as muscle and fat.Â  The elimination of drug from tissue distribution depends largely upon the ability of binding sites in the circulation to carry it to the liver where it is metabolized.</p>
<p>After injection of Sensorcaine (bupivacaine HCl) for caudal, epidural, or peripheral nerve block in man, peak levels of bupivacaine in the blood are reached in 30 to 45 minutes, followed by a decline to insignificant levels during the next 3 to 6 hours.</p>
<p>Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local anesthetics can be significantly altered by the presence of hepatic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>, addition of epinephrine, factors affecting urinary pH, renal blood flow, the route of drug administration, and the age of the patient.Â  The half-life of bupivacaine in adults is 2.7 hours and in neonates 8.1 hours.</p>
<p>In clinical studies, elderly patients reached the maximal spread of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> and maximal motor blockade more rapidly than younger patients.Â  Elderly patients also exhibited higher peak plasma concentrations following administration of this product.Â  The total plasma clearance was decreased in these patients.</p>
<p>Amide-type local anesthetics such as bupivacaine are metabolized primarily in the liver via conjugation with glucuronic acid.Â  Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span>, especially those with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span>, may be more susceptible to the potential toxicities of the amide-type local anesthetics. Pipecoloxylidine is the major metabolite of bupivacaine.</p>
<p>The kidney is the main excretory organ for most local anesthetics and their metabolites.Â  Urinary excretion is affected by urinary perfusion and factors affecting urinary pH.Â  Only 6% of bupivacaine is excreted unchanged in the urine.</p>
<p>When administered in recommended doses and concentrations, Sensorcaine (bupivacaine HCl) does not ordinarily produce irritation or tissue damage and does not cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">methemoglobinemia</span>.</p>

<p>Local anesthetic solutions containing antimicrobial preservatives, i.e., those supplied in multiple-dose vials, should not be used for epidural or caudal anesthesia because safety has not been established with regard to intrathecal injection, either intentionally or unintentionally, of such preservatives.</p>
<p>Intra-articular infusions of local anesthetics following arthroscopic and other surgical procedures is an unapproved use, and there have been post-marketing reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span> in patients receiving such infusions. The majority of reported cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span> have involved the shoulder joint; cases of gleno-humeral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span> have been described in pediatric and adult patients following intra-articular infusions of local anesthetics with and without epinephrine for periods of 48 to 72 hours. There is insufficient information to determine whether shorter infusion periods are not associated with these findings. The time of onset of symptoms, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77074" conceptname="Joint pain">joint pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4060220" conceptname="Stiff neck">stiffness</span> and loss of motion can be variable, but may begin as early as the 2nd month after surgery. Currently, there is no effective treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span>; patients who experienced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span> have required additional diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and some required arthroplasty or shoulder replacement.</p>
<p>It is essential that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span> for blood or cerebrospinal fluid (where applicable) be done prior to injecting any local anesthetic, both the original dose and all subsequent doses, to avoid intravascular or subarachnoid injection.

<p>Bupivacaine with Epinephrine 1:200,000 or other vasopressors should not be used concomitantly with ergot-type oxytocic drugs, because a severe persistent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> may occur. Â Likewise, solutions of bupivacaine containing a vasoconstrictor, such as epinephrine, should be used with extreme caution in patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) or antidepressants of the triptyline or imipramine types, because severe prolonged <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> may result.</p>
<p>Until further experience is gained in pediatric patients younger than 12 years, administration of bupivacaine in this age group is not recommended.</p>
<p>Mixing or the prior or intercurrent use of any local anesthetic with bupivacaine cannot be recommended because of insufficient data on the clinical use of such mixtures.</p>

<h2>Epidural Anesthesia</h2>
<p class="First">During epidural administration of Sensorcaine (bupivacaine HCl), 0.5% and 0.75% solutions should be administered in incremental doses of 3 mL to 5 mL with sufficient time between doses to detect toxic manifestations of unintentional intravascular or intrathecal injection.Â Injections should be made slowly, with frequent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspirations</span> before and during the injection to avoid intravascular injection.Â  Syringe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspirations</span> should also be performed before and during each supplemental injection in continuous (intermittent) catheter techniques.Â  An intravascular injection is still possible even if <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspirations</span> for blood are negative.</p>
<p>During the administration of epidural anesthesia, it is recommended that a test dose be administered initially and the effects monitored before the full dose is given.Â  When using a â€œcontinuousâ€? catheter technique, test doses should be given prior to both the original and all reinforcing doses, because plastic tubing in the epidural space can migrate into a blood vessel or through the dura.Â When clinical conditions permit, the test dose should contain epinephrine (10 mcg to 15 mcg has been suggested) to serve as a warning of unintended intravascular injection.Â  If injected into a blood vessel, this amount of epinephrine is likely to produce a transient â€œepinephrine responseâ€? within 45 seconds, consisting of an increase in heart rate and/or systolic blood pressure, circumoral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260836" conceptname="Blanching of skin">pallor</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315078" conceptname="Palpitations">palpitations</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436817" conceptname="Feeling nervous">nervousness</span> in the unsedated patient.Â The sedated patient may exhibit only a pulse rate increase of 20 or more beats per minute for 15 or more seconds.Â Therefore, following the test dose, the heart rate should be monitored for a heart rate increase.Â  Patients on beta-blockers may not manifest changes in heart rate, but blood pressure monitoring can detect a transient rise in systolic blood pressure.Â  The test dose should also contain 10 mg to 15 mg of Sensorcaine or an equivalent amount of another local anesthetic to detect an unintended intrathecal administration.Â  This will be evidenced within a few minutes by signs of spinal block (e.g., decreased sensation of the buttocks, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154696" conceptname="Spastic paresis">paresis</span> of the legs, or, in the sedated patient, absent knee jerk).Â  An intravascular or subarachnoid injection is still possible even if results of the test dose are negative.Â  The test dose itself may produce a systemic toxic reaction, high spinal or epinephrine-induced cardiovascular effects.</p>
<p>Injection of repeated doses of local anesthetics may cause significant increases in plasma levels with each repeated dose due to slow accumulation of the drug or its metabolites, or to slow metabolic degradation.Â  Tolerance to elevated blood levels varies with the status of the patient.Â  Debilitated, elderly patients and acutely ill patients should be given reduced doses commensurate with their age and physical status.Â  Local anesthetics should also be used with caution in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> or heartblock.</p>
<p>Careful and constant monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory (adequacy of ventilation) vital signs and the patientâ€™s state of consciousness should be performed after each local anesthetic injection.Â  It should be kept in mind at such times that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">restlessness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, incoherent speech, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">lightheadedness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4151171" conceptname="Numbness of limbs">numbness</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4193492" conceptname="Acroparesthesia">tingling</span> of the mouth and lips, metallic taste, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377575" conceptname="Tinnitus">tinnitus</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079185" conceptname="Hazy vision">blurred vision</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremors</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4247265" conceptname="Muscle twitch">twitching</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> may be early warning signs of central nervous system toxicity.</p>
<p>Local anesthetic solutions containing a vasoconstrictor should be used cautiously and in carefully restricted quantities in areas of the body supplied by end arteries or having otherwise compromised blood supply such as digits, nose, external ear, or penis.Â  Patients with hypertensive vascular disease may exhibit exaggerated vasoconstrictor response.Â  Ischemic injury or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280654" conceptname="Necrosis">necrosis</span> may result. </p>
<p>Because amide-local anesthetics such as bupivacaine are metabolized by the liver, these drugs, especially repeat doses, should be used cautiously in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span>.Â  Patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span>, because of their inability to metabolize local anesthetics normally, are at a greater risk of developing toxic plasma concentrations.Â  Local anesthetics should also be used with caution in patients with impaired cardiovascular function because they may be less able to compensate for functional changes associated with the prolongation of AV conduction produced by these drugs.</p>
<p>Serious dose-related <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmias</span> may occur if preparations containing a vasoconstrictor such as epinephrine are employed in patients during or following the administration of potent inhalation anesthetics.Â  In deciding whether to use these products concurrently in the same patient, the combined action of both agents upon the myocardium, the concentration and volume of vasoconstrictor used, and the time since injection, when applicable, should be taken into account.</p>
<p>Many drugs used during the conduct of anesthesia are considered potential triggering agents for familial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440285" conceptname="Malignant hyperthermia">malignant hyperthermia</span>.Â  Because it is not known whether amide-type local anesthetics may trigger this reaction and because the need for supplemental general anesthesia cannot be predicted in advance, it is suggested that a standard protocol for management should be available.Â  Early unexplained signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317376" conceptname="Tachypnea">tachypnea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4354255" conceptname="Labile blood pressure">labile blood pressure</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span> may precede temperature elevation.Â Successful outcome is dependent on early diagnosis, prompt discontinuance of the suspect triggering agent(s) and prompt institution of treatment, including oxygen therapy, indicated supportive measures and dantrolene (consult dantrolene sodium intravenous package insert before using).</p>

<p>Sensorcaine is contraindicated for obstetrical paracervical block anesthesia.</p>
<p>Local anesthetics rapidly cross the placenta, and when used for epidural, caudal, or pudendal block anesthesia, can cause varying degrees of maternal, fetal, and neonatal toxicity (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><a href="#d1ef81f2-4b5f-448d-b246-628a82406f51">CLINICAL</a>Â <a href="#d1ef81f2-4b5f-448d-b246-628a82406f51">PHARMACOLOGY</a><span class="Italics"><a href="#d1ef81f2-4b5f-448d-b246-628a82406f51">,</a></span><span class="Italics">Â <a href="#d1ef81f2-4b5f-448d-b246-628a82406f51">Pharmacokinetics</a></span></span></span>).Â  The incidence and degree of toxicity depend upon the procedure performed, the type, and amount of drug used, and the technique of drug administration.Â Adverse reactions in the parturient, fetus, and neonate involve alterations of the central nervous system, peripheral vascular tone, and cardiac function. Â </p>
<p>Maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> has resulted from regional anesthesia.Â  Local anesthetics produce vasodilation by blocking sympathetic nerves.Â  Elevating the patientâ€™s legs and positioning her on her left side will help prevent decreases in blood pressure.Â  The fetal heart rate also should be monitored continuously and electronic fetal monitoring is highly advisable.</p>
<p>Epidural, caudal, or pudendal anesthesia may alter the forces of parturition through changes in uterine contractility or maternal expulsive efforts.Â  Epidural anesthesia has been reported to prolong the second stage of labor by removing the parturientâ€™s reflex urge to bear down or by interfering with motor function.Â  The use of obstetrical anesthesia may increase the need for forceps assistance.</p>
<p>The use of some local anesthetic drug products during labor and delivery may be followed by diminished muscle strength and tone for the first day or two of life.Â  This has not been reported with bupivacaine.</p>
<p>It is extremely important to avoid aortocaval compression by the gravid uterus during administration of regional block to parturients.Â  To do this, the patient must be maintained in the left lateral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4127794" conceptname="Decubitus">decubitus</span> position or a blanket roll or sandbag may be placed beneath the right hip and gravid uterus displaced to the left.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Reactions to Sensorcaine (bupivacaine HCl) are characteristic of those associated with other amide-type local anesthetics.Â  A major cause of adverse reactions to this group of drugs is excessive plasma levels, which may be due to overdosage, unintentional intravascular injection, or slow metabolic degradation.</p>
<p>The most commonly encountered acute adverse experiences which demand immediate counter-measures are related to the central nervous system and the cardiovascular system.Â  These adverse experiences are generally dose related and due to high plasma levels which may result from overdosage, rapid absorption from the injection site, diminished tolerance, or from unintentional intravascular injection of the local anesthetic solution.Â  In addition to systemic dose-related toxicity, unintentional subarachnoid injection of drug during the intended performance of caudal or lumbar epidural block or nerve blocks near the vertebral column (especially in the head and neck region) may result in underventilation or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span>(â€œTotal or High Spinalâ€?).Â  Also, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> due to loss of sympathetic tone and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275136" conceptname="Paralysis of diaphragm">respiratory paralysis</span> or underventilation due to cephalad extension of the motor level of anesthesia may occur.Â  This may lead to secondary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span> if untreated.Â  Patients over 65 years, particularly those with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, may be at increased risk for experiencing the hypotensive effects of bupivacaine.Â  Factors influencing plasma protein binding, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidosis</span>, systemic diseases which alter protein production, or competition of other drugs for protein binding sites, may diminish individual tolerance.</p>

<h2>Management of Local Anesthetic Emergencies</h2>
<p class="First">The first consideration is prevention, best accomplished by careful and constant monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory vital signs and the patientâ€™s state of consciousness after each local anesthetic injection.Â At the first sign of change, oxygen should be administered.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">The first step in the management of systemic toxic reactions, as well as underventilation or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span> due to unintentional subarachnoid injection of drug solution, consists of Â </span><span class="Bold">immediate </span>Â <span class="Italics">attention to the establishment and maintenance of a patent airway and effective assisted or controlled ventilation with100% oxygen with a delivery system capable of permitting immediate positive airway pressure by mask.</span> This may prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> if they have not already occurred.</p>
<p>If necessary, use drugs to control the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>.Â  A 50 mg to 100 mg bolus IV injection of succinylcholine will paralyze the patient without depressing the central nervous or cardiovascular systems and facilitate ventilation.Â  A bolus IV dose of 5 mg to 10 mg of diazepam or 50 mg to 100 mg of thiopental will permit ventilation and counteract central nervous system stimulation, but these drugs also depress the central nervous system, respiratory, and cardiac function, add to postictal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and may result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span>.Â  Intravenous barbiturates, anticonvulsant agents, or muscle relaxants should only be administered by those familiar with their use.Â  Immediately after the institution of these ventilatory measures, the adequacy of the circulation should be evaluated. Supportive treatment of circulatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> may require administration of intravenous fluids, and when appropriate, a vasopressor dictated by the clinical situation (such as ephedrine or epinephrine to enhance myocardial contractile force).</p>
<p>Endotracheal intubation, employing drugs and techniques familiar to the clinician, may be indicated after initial administration of oxygen by mask if difficulty is encountered in the maintenance of a patent airway, or if prolonged ventilatory support (assisted or controlled) is indicated.</p>
<p>Recent clinical data from patients experiencing local anesthetic-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> demonstrated rapid development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4105765" conceptname="Hypercapnia">hypercarbia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidosis</span> with bupivacaine within a minute of the onset of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>.Â  These observations suggest that oxygen consumption and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135927" conceptname="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</span> production are greatly increased during local anesthetic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> and emphasize the importance of immediate and effective ventilation with oxygen which may avoid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span>.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">The dose of any local anesthetic administered varies with the anesthetic procedure, the area to be anesthetized, the vascularity of the tissues, the number of neuronal segments to be blocked, the depth of anesthesia and degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">muscle relaxation</span> required, the duration of anesthesia desired, individual tolerance, and the physical condition of the patient.Â  The smallest dose and concentration required to produce the desired result should be administered.Â  Dosages of Sensorcaine should be reduced for elderly and/or debilitated patients and patients with cardiac and/or liver disease.Â  The rapid injection of a large volume of local anesthetic solution should be avoided and fractional (incremental) doses should be used when feasible.</p>
<p>For specific techniques and procedures, refer to standard textbooks.</p>
<p>There have been adverse event reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span> in patients receiving intra-articular infusions of local anesthetics following arthroscopic and other surgical procedures. Sensorcaine is not approved for this use (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><a href="#f6b54602-a064-4bd6-aaeb-f86d9065da2b">WARNINGS</a>Â </span></span>and <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><a href="#b8f3442a-be8a-476f-bd9a-ad736e9c9494">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span></span>).</p>
<p>In recommended doses, Sensorcaine (bupivacaine HCl) produces complete sensory block, but the effect on motor function differs among the three concentrations.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">0.25%</span></span>â€”when used for caudal, epidural, or peripheral nerve block, produces incomplete motor block.Â  Should be used for operations in which <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">muscle relaxation</span> is not important, or when another means of providing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">muscle relaxation</span> is used concurrently.Â Onset of action may be slower than with the 0.5% or 0.75% solutions.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">0.5%</span></span>â€”provides motor blockade for caudal, epidural, or nerve block, but <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">muscle relaxation</span> may be inadequate for operations in which complete <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">muscle relaxation</span> is essential.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">0.75%</span></span>â€”produces complete motor block.Â  Most useful for epidural block in abdominal operations requiring complete <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">muscle relaxation</span>, and for retrobulbar anesthesia.Â  Not for obstetrical anesthesia.</p>
<p>The duration of anesthesia with Sensorcaine is such that for most indications, a single dose is sufficient.</p>
<p>Maximum dosage limit must be individualized in each case after evaluating the size and physical status of the patient, as well as the usual rate of systemic absorption from a particular injection site.Â  Most experience to date is with single doses of Sensorcaine up to 225 mg with epinephrine 1:200,000 and 175 mg without epinephrine; more or less drug may be used depending on individualization of each case.</p>
<p>These doses may be repeated up to once every three hours.Â  In clinical studies to date, total daily doses have been up to 400 mg.Â  Until further experience is gained, this dose should not be exceeded in 24 hours.Â  The duration of anesthetic effect may be prolonged by the addition of epinephrine.</p>
<p>The dosages in Table 1 have generally proved satisfactory and are recommended as a guide for use in the average adult.Â  These dosages should be reduced for elderly or debilitated patients.Â Until further experience is gained, Sensorcaine is not recommended for pediatric patients younger than 12 years.Â  Sensorcaine is contraindicated for obstetrical paracervical blocks, and is not recommended for intravenous regional anesthesia (Bier Block).</p>

<h2>Use in Epidural Anesthesia</h2>
<p class="First">During epidural administration of Sensorcaine, 0.5% and 0.75% solutions should be administered in incremental doses of 3 mL to 5 mL with sufficient time between doses to detect toxic manifestations of unintentional intravascular or intrathecal injection.Â  In obstetrics, only the 0.5% and 0.25% concentrations should be used; incremental doses of 3 mL to 5 mL of the 0.5% solution not exceeding 50 mg to 100 mg at any dosing interval are recommended.Â  Repeat doses should be preceded by a test dose containing epinephrine if not contraindicated.Â  Use only the single dose ampules and single dose vials for caudal or epidural anesthesia; the multiple dose vials contain a preservative and therefore should not be used for these procedures.</p>

<h2>Use in Dentistry</h2>
<p class="First">The 0.5% concentration with epinephrine is recommended for infiltration and block injection in the maxillary and mandibular area when a longer duration of local anesthetic action is desired, such as for oral surgical procedures generally associated with significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439502" conceptname="Postoperative pain">postoperative pain</span>. The average dose of 1.8 mL (9 mg) per injection site will usually suffice; an occasional second dose of 1.8 mL (9 mg) may be used if necessary to produce adequate anesthesia after making allowance for 2 to 10 minutes onset time (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><a href="#d1ef81f2-4b5f-448d-b246-628a82406f51">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span></span>). The lowest effective dose should be employed and time should be allowed between injections; it is recommended that the total dose for all injection sites, spread out over a single dental sitting, should not ordinarily exceed 90 mg for a healthy adult patient (ten 1.8 mL injections of 0.5% sensorcaine with epinephrine). Injections should be made slowly and with frequent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspirations</span>. Until further experience is gained, sensorcaine in dentistry is not recommended for pediatric patients younger than 12 years.</p>
<br><p>Unused portions of solution not containing preservatives, i.e., those supplied in single dose ampules and single dose vials, should be discarded following initial use.</p>
<br><p>This product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Solutions which are discolored or which contain particulate matter should not be administered.</p>
