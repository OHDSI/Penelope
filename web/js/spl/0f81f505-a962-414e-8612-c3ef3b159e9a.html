<h2>WARNINGS</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">1.</span><span class="Bold">Experienced Physician and Institution</span></p>
<p>Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103718" conceptname="Acute promyelocytic leukemia">acute promyelocytic leukemia</span> (APL) are at high risk in general and can have severe adverse reactions to tretinoin. Tretinoin should therefore be administered only to patients with APL under the strict supervision of a physician who is experienced in the management of patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138708" conceptname="Acute leukemia">acute leukemia</span> and in a facility with laboratory and supportive services sufficient to monitor drug tolerance and protect and maintain a patient compromised by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">drug toxicity</span>, including respiratory compromise. Use of tretinoin requires that the physician concludes that the possible benefit to the patient outweighs the following known adverse effects of the therapy.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">2</span>. <span class="Bold">Retinoic Acid-APL Syndrome</span></p>
<p>About 25% of patients with APL treated with tretinoin have experienced a syndrome called the retinoic-acid-APL (RA-APL) syndrome characterized by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">dyspnea</span>, acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4158346" conceptname="Respiratory distress">respiratory distress</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span>, radiographic pulmonary infiltrates, pleural and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4161701" conceptname="Pericardial effusion">pericardial effusions</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span>, and hepatic, renal, and multi-organ failure. This syndrome has occasionally been accompanied by impaired myocardial contractility and episodic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>. It has been observed with or without concomitant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438398" conceptname="Leukocytosis">leukocytosis</span>. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation have been required in some cases due to progressive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437390" conceptname="Hypoxemia">hypoxemia</span>, and several patients have expired with multi-organ failure. The syndrome generally occurs during the first month of treatment, with some cases reported following the first dose of tretinoin. </p>
<p>The management of the syndrome has not been defined rigorously, but high dose steroids given at the first suspicion of the RA-APL syndrome appear to reduce morbidity and mortality. At the first signs suggestive of the syndrome (unexplained <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">dyspnea</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span>, abnormal chest auscultatory findings or radiographic abnormalities), high dose steroids (dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously administered every 12 hours for 3 days or until the resolution of symptoms) should be immediately initiated, irrespective of the leukocyte count. The majority of patients do not require termination of tretinoin therapy during treatment of the RA-APL syndrome. However, in cases of moderate and severe RA-APL syndrome, temporary interruption of tretinoin therapy should be considered.Â <span class="Sup">1</span></p>

<p>During tretinoin treatment about 40% of patients will develop rapidly evolving <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438398" conceptname="Leukocytosis">leukocytosis</span>. Patients who present with high WBC at diagnosis (&gt; 5x10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L) have an increased risk of a further rapid increase in WBC counts. Rapidly evolving <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438398" conceptname="Leukocytosis">leukocytosis</span> is associated with a higher risk of life threatening complications.</p>
<p>If signs and symptoms of the RA-APL syndrome are present together with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438398" conceptname="Leukocytosis">leukocytosis</span>, treatment with high dose steroids should be initiated immediately. Some investigators routinely add chemotherapy to tretinoin treatment in the case of patients presenting with a WBC count of &gt; 5x10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L or in the case of a rapid increase in WBC count for patients leukopenic at start of treatment, and have reported a lower incidence of the RA-APL syndrome. Consideration could be given to adding full dose chemotherapy (including an anthracycline if not contraindicated) to the tretinoin therapy on day 1 or 2 for patients presenting with a WBC count of &gt; 5x10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L, or immediately, for patients presenting with a WBC count of &lt; 5x10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L, if the WBC count reaches â‰¥ 6x10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L by day 5, or â‰¥ 10x10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L by day 10, or â‰¥ 15x10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L by day 28.</p>

<p>There is a high risk that a severely deformed infant will result if tretinoin is administered during pregnancy. If, nonetheless, it is determined that tretinoin represents the best available treatment for a pregnant woman or a woman of childbearing potential, it must be assured that the patient has received full information and warnings of the risk to the fetus if she were to be pregnant and of the risk of possible contraception failure and has been instructed in the need to use two reliable forms of contraception simultaneously during therapy and for 1 month following discontinuation of therapy, and has acknowledged her understanding of the need for using dual contraception, unless abstinence is the chosen method.</p>
<p>Within 1 week prior to the institution of tretinoin therapy, the patient should have blood or urine collected for a serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL. When possible, tretinoin therapy should be delayed until a negative result from this test is obtained. When a delay is not possible, the patient should be placed on two reliable forms of contraception. Pregnancy testing and contraception counseling should be repeated monthly throughout the period of tretinoin treatment.</p>

<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Tretinoin is not a cytolytic agent but instead induces cytodifferentiation and decreased proliferation of APL cells in culture and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span>. In APL patients, tretinoin treatment produces an initial maturation of the primitive promyelocytes derived from the leukemic clone, followed by a repopulation of the bone marrow and peripheral blood by normal, polyclonal hematopoietic cells in patients achieving complete remission (CR). The exact mechanism of action of tretinoin in APL is unknown.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Tretinoin activity is primarily due to the parent drug. In human pharmacokinetics studies, orally administered drug was well absorbed into the systemic circulation, with approximately two-thirds of the administered radiolabel recovered in the urine. The terminal elimination half-life of tretinoin following initial dosing is 0.5 to 2 hours in patients with APL. There is evidence that tretinoin induces its own metabolism. Plasma tretinoin concentrations decrease on average to one-third of their day 1 values during 1 week of continuous therapy. Mean Â± SD peak tretinoin concentrations decreased from 394 Â± 89 to 138 Â± 139 ng/mL, while area under the curve (AUC) values decreased from 537 Â± 191 ngâ€¢h/mL to 249 Â± 185 ngâ€¢h/mL during 45 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> daily dosing in 7 APL patients. Increasing the dose to â€œcorrectâ€? for this change has not increased response.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="i4i_section_id_af17c09a-81c4-44c3-96ac-c31011f5b745"></a><a name="section-3.2.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Absorption</h3>
<p class="First">A single 45 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (~ 80 mg) oral dose to APL patients resulted in a mean Â± SD peak tretinoin concentration of 347 Â± 266 ng/mL. Time to reach peak concentration was between 1 and 2 hours.</p>

<h3>Distribution</h3>
<p class="First">The apparent volume of distribution of tretinoin has not been determined. Tretinoin is greater than 95% bound in plasma, predominately to albumin. Plasma protein binding remains constant over the concentration range of 10 to 500 ng/mL.</p>

<h3>Metabolism</h3>
<p class="First">Tretinoin metabolites have been identified in plasma and urine. Cytochrome P450 enzymes have been implicated in the oxidative metabolism of tretinoin. Metabolites include 13- <span class="Italics">cis</span> retinoic acid, 4-oxo <span class="Italics">trans </span>retinoic acid, 4-oxo <span class="Italics">cis</span> retinoic acid, and 4-oxo <span class="Italics">trans</span> retinoic acid glucuronide. In APL patients, daily administration of a 45 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> dose of tretinoin resulted in an approximately tenfold increase in the urinary excretion of 4-oxo <span class="Italics">trans</span> retinoic acid glucuronide after 2 to 6 weeks of continuous dosing, when compared to baseline values.</p>

<h3>Excretion</h3>
<p class="First">Studies with radiolabeled drug have demonstrated that after the oral administration of 2.75 and <br>50 mg doses of tretinoin, greater than 90% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces. Based upon data from 3 subjects, approximately 63% of radioactivity was recovered in the urine within 72 hours and 31% appeared in the feces within 6 days.</p>

<h3>Special Populations</h3>
<p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of tretinoin have not been separately evaluated in women, in members of different ethnic groups, or in individuals with renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic insufficiency</span>.</p>

<h3>Drug-Drug Interactions</h3>
<p class="First">In 13 patients who had received daily doses of tretinoin for 4 consecutive weeks, administration of ketoconazole (400 to 1200 mg oral dose) 1 hour prior to the administration of the tretinoin dose on day 29 led to a 72% increase (218 Â± 224 vs. 375 Â± 285 ngâ€¢h/mL) in tretinoin mean plasma AUC. The precise cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in these interactions have not been specified; <span class="Italics">CYP</span> 3A4, 2C8 and 2E have been implicated in various preliminary reports.</p>

<h2>Clinical Studies</h2>
<p class="First">Tretinoin has been investigated in 114 previously treated APL patients and in 67 previously untreated (â€œde novoâ€?) patients in one open-label, uncontrolled single investigator clinical study (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center [MSKCC]) and in two cohorts of compassionate cases treated by multiple investigators under the auspices of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). All patients received 45 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day as a divided oral dose for up to 90 days or 30 days beyond the day that CR was reached. Results are shown in the following table:</p>

<p>The median time to CR was between 40 and 50 days (range: 2 to 120 days). Most patients in these studies received cytotoxic chemotherapy during the remission phase. These results compare to the 30% to 50% CR rate and, â‰¤ 6 month median survival reported for cytotoxic chemotherapy of APL in the treatment of relapse.</p>
<p>Ten of 15 pediatric cases achieved CR (8 of 10 males and 2 of 5 females). There were insufficient patients of black, Hispanic or Asian derivation to estimate relative response rates in these groups, but responses were seen in each category. </p>
<p>Responses were seen in 3 of 4 patients for whom cytogenetic analysis failed to detect the t(15;17) translocation typically seen in APL. The t(15;17) translocation results in the PML/RARÎ± gene, which appears necessary for this disease. Molecular genetic studies were not conducted in these cases, but it is likely they represent cases with a masked translocation giving rise to PML/RARÎ±. Responses to tretinoin have not been observed in cases in which PML/RARÎ± fusion has been shown to be absent.</p>

<p>Tretinoin has teratogenic and embryotoxic effects in mice, rats, hamsters, rabbits and pigtail monkeys, and may be expected to cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Tretinoin causes fetal resorptions and a decrease in live fetuses in all animals studied. Gross external, soft tissue and skeletal alterations occurred at doses higher than 0.7 mg/kg/day in mice, 2 mg/kg/day in rats, 7 mg/kg/day in hamsters, and at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day, the only dose tested, in pigtail monkeys (about 1/20, 1/4, and 1/2 and 4 times the human dose, respectively, on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Although experience with humans administered tretinoin is extremely limited, increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4067106" conceptname="Miscarriage">spontaneous abortions</span> and major human fetal abnormalities related to the use of other retinoids have been documented in humans.

Some of these abnormalities were fatal. Cases of IQ scores less than 85, with or without obvious CNS abnormalities, have also been reported. All fetuses exposed during pregnancy can be affected and at the present time there is no antepartum means of determining which fetuses are and are not affected.</p>
<p>Effective contraception must be used by all females during tretinoin therapy and for 1 month following discontinuation of therapy. Contraception must be used even when there is a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4035976" conceptname="Sterility">infertility</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span>, unless a hysterectomy has been performed.

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Tretinoin has potentially significant toxic side effects in APL patients. Patients undergoing therapy should be closely observed for signs of respiratory compromise and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438398" conceptname="Leukocytosis">leukocytosis</span> (see boxed <a href="#id_0590431a-dbe6-4e16-8318-677913748f05">WARNINGS</a>).

<h3>Drugs Metabolized By the Hepatic P450 System</h3>
<p class="First">As tretinoin is metabolized by the hepatic P450 system, there is a potential for alteration of pharmacokinetics parameters in patients administered concomitant medications that are also inducers or inhibitors of this system. Medications that generally induce hepatic P450 enzymes include rifampicin, glucocorticoids, phenobarbital and pentobarbital. Medications that generally inhibit hepatic P450 enzymes include ketoconazole, cimetidine, erythromycin, verapamil, diltiazem and cyclosporine. To date there are no data to suggest that co-use with these medications increases or decreases either efficacy or toxicity of tretinoin. </p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">No long term carcinogenicity studies with tretinoin have been conducted. In short term carcinogenicity studies, tretinoin at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (about 2 times the human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis) was shown to increase the rate of diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced mouse liver <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> and carcinomas. Tretinoin was negative when tested in the Ames and Chinese hamster V79 cell HGPRT assays for mutagenicity. A twofold increase in the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) has been demonstrated in human diploid fibroblasts, but other chromosome aberration assays, including an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> assay in human peripheral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span> and an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus assay, did not show a clastogenic or aneuploidogenic effect. Adverse effects on fertility and reproductive performance were not observed in studies conducted in rats at doses up to 5 mg/kg/day (about 2/3 the human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). In a 6 week toxicology study in dogs, minimal to marked testicular degeneration, with increased numbers of immature spermatozoa, were observed at 10 mg/kg/day (about 4 times the equivalent human dose in   mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>).</p>

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">There are limited clinical data on the pediatric use of tretinoin. Of 15 pediatric patients (age range: 1 to 16 years) treated with tretinoin, the incidence of complete remission was 67%. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 year have not been established. Some pediatric patients experience severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312902" conceptname="Benign intracranial hypertension">pseudotumor cerebri</span>, requiring analgesic treatment and lumbar puncture for relief. Increased caution is recommended in the treatment of pediatric patients. Dose reduction may be considered for pediatric patients experiencing serious and/or intolerable toxicity; however, the efficacy and safety of tretinoin at doses lower than 45 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day have not been evaluated in the pediatric population.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of tretinoin, 21.4% were 60 and over.

<p class="First">APL patients treated with tretinoin have experienced a potentially fatal syndrome characterized by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">dyspnea</span>, acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4158346" conceptname="Respiratory distress">respiratory distress</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span>, radiographic pulmonary infiltrates, pleural and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4161701" conceptname="Pericardial effusion">pericardial effusions</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span>, and hepatic, renal, and multi-organ failure. This syndrome has occasionally been accompanied by impaired myocardial contractility and episodic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> and has been observed with or without concomitant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438398" conceptname="Leukocytosis">leukocytosis</span>. Some patients have expired due to progressive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437390" conceptname="Hypoxemia">hypoxemia</span> and multi-organ failure. The syndrome generally occurs during the first month of treatment, with some cases reported following the first dose of tretinoin. The management of the syndrome has not been defined rigorously, but high dose steroids given at the first signs of the syndrome appear to reduce morbidity and mortality. Treatment with dexamethasone, 10 mg intravenously administered every 12 hours for 3 days or until resolution of symptoms, should be initiated without delay at the first suspicion of symptoms (one or more of the following: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">dyspnea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span>, abnormal chest auscultatory findings or radiographic abnormalities). Sixty percent or more of patients treated with tretinoin may require high dose steroids because of these symptoms.

<h1>Information for the Patient</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNING TO FEMALE PATIENTS </span></p>
<p>YOU MUST NOT BECOME PREGNANT DURING TRETINOIN TREATMENT. There is an extremely high risk that a deformed baby will result if you become pregnant while taking tretinoin, in any amount, for even short periods of time. Potentially any exposed fetuses can be affected. There is also an increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4067106" conceptname="Miscarriage">miscarriage</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439128" conceptname="Extreme immaturity">Premature births</span> may also occur. </p>
<p>Effective contraception (birth control) should be discussed with your doctor. Two forms of reliable contraception must be used during therapy, and must be continued for one month after tretinoin treatment has stopped. If directed by your doctor, two forms of reliable contraception must also be used simultaneously for at least one month before beginning therapy. It is recommended that you either abstain from sexual intercourse or use two reliable kinds of birth control at the same time. Birth control must be used even if you think you cannot become pregnant, unless you have had a hysterectomy. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or become pregnant while on tretinoin therapy or during the month after treatment has stopped, immediately contact your doctor to discuss the desirability of continuing the pregnancy. </p>
<p>YOU MUST NOT TAKE TRETINOIN IF YOU ARE A NURSING MOTHER.</p>
<p>Tretinoin should not be taken by nursing mothers since it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. Since many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from tretinoin, mothers should discontinue nursing prior to taking this drug. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">General guidelines for taking your medication...</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Call your doctor if you have any questions or experience any severe or troubling symptoms. </li>
<li>Tretinoin does not need to be refrigerated. However, do not expose the capsules to sunlight or excessive heat. </li>
<li>Be sure to take your medication as prescribed by your doctor. Read the prescription label on the package carefully. If there is anything you donâ€™t understand, ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain it to you. </li>
<li>Keep tretinoin and all medications out of the reach of children.</li>
</ul>
<p>Store at 20Â° to 25Â°C (68Â° to 77Â°F).</p>
