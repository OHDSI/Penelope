<h1>
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Methamphetamine is a sympathomimetic amine with CNS stimulant activity. Peripheral actions include elevation of systolic and diastolic blood pressures and weak bronchodilator and respiratory stimulant action. Drugs of this class used in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433736" conceptname="Obesity">obesity</span> are commonly known as "<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">anorectics</span>" or "anorexigenics". It has not been established, however, that the action of such drugs in treating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433736" conceptname="Obesity">obesity</span> is primarily one of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">appetite suppression</span>. Other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may be involved, for example.</p>
<p>Adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with "<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">anorectic</span>" drugs, lose more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet, as determined in relatively short-term clinical trials.</p>
<p>The magnitude of increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The origins of the increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> due to the various possible drug effects are not established. The amount of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> associated with the use of an "<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">anorectic</span>" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> appears to be related in part to variables other than the drug prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated, and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span>.</p>
<p>The natural history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433736" conceptname="Obesity">obesity</span> is measured in years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited.</p>
<p>The mechanism of action involved in producing the beneficial behavioral changes seen in hyperkinetic children receiving methamphetamine is unknown.</p>
<p>In humans, methamphetamine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The primary site of metabolism is in the liver by aromatic hydroxylation, N-dealkylation and deamination. At least seven metabolites have been identified in the urine. The biological half-life has been reported in the range of 4 to 5 hours. Excretion occurs primarily in the urine and is dependent on urine pH. Alkaline urine will significantly increase the drug half-life. Approximately 62% of an oral dose is eliminated in the urine within the first 24 hours with about one-third as intact drug and the remainder as metabolites.</p>

</ul>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">Hypertension</span> and other Cardiovascular Conditions:</span> Stimulant medications cause a modest increase in average blood pressure (about 2-4 mmHg) and average heart rate (about 3-6 bpm), and individuals may have larger increases. While the mean changes alone would not be expected to have short-term consequences, all patients should be monitored for larger changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Caution is indicated in treating patients whose underlying medical conditions might be compromised by increases in blood pressure or heart rate, e.g., those with pre-existing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, recent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmia</span>.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">Long-Term Suppression of Growth: </span>Careful follow-up of weight and height in children ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or non-medication treatment groups over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate-treated and non-medication treated children over 36 months (to the ages of 10 to 13 years), suggests that consistently medicated children (i.e., treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have a temporary slowing in growth rate (on average, a total of about 2 cm less growth in height and 2.7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years), without evidence of growth rebound during this period of development. Published data are inadequate to determine whether chronic use of amphetamines may cause a similar suppression of growth, however, it is anticipated that they likely have this effect as well. Therefore, growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants, and patients who are not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">Seizures</span>: </span>There is some clinical evidence that stimulants may lower the convulsive threshold in patients with prior history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>, in patients with prior EEG abnormalities in absence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>, and, very rarely, in patients without a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> and no prior EEG evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>.

Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild; however, very rare sequelae include digital ulceration and/or soft tissue breakdown. Effects of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon, were observed in post-marketing reports at different times and at therapeutic doses in all age groups throughout the course of treatment. Signs and symptoms generally improve after reduction in dose or discontinuation of drug. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228617" conceptname="Add">ADHD</span> stimulants.

It should be considered only in light of the complete history and evaluation of the child. The decision to prescribe DESOXYN tablets should depend on the physician's assessment of the chronicity and severity of the child's symptoms and their appropriateness for his/her age. Prescription should not depend solely on the presence of one or more of the behavioral characteristics.</p>
<p>When these symptoms are associated with acute stress reactions, treatment with DESOXYN tablets is usually not indicated.</p>
<p>Clinical experience suggests that in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychotic</span> children, administration of DESOXYN tablets may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder.</p>
<p>Amphetamines have been reported to exacerbate motor and phonic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4297396" conceptname="Tic">tics</span> and Tourette's syndrome. Therefore, clinical evaluation for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4297396" conceptname="Tic">tics</span> and Tourette's syndrome in children and their families should precede use of stimulant medications.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Geriatric Use:</span> Clinical Studies of DESOXYN did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 years and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy observed in this population.
