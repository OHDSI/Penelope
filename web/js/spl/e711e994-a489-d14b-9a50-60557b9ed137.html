<h1>DESCRIPTION:
</h1>
<p class="First">LUNESTA (eszopiclone) is a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic agent that is a pyrrolopyrazine derivative of the cyclopyrrolone class.  The chemical name of eszopiclone is (+)-(5S)-6-(5-chloropyridin-2-yl)-7-oxo-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[3,4-b] pyrazin-5-yl 4-methylpiperazine-1-carboxylate.  Its molecular weight is 388.81, and its empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">17</span>H<span class="Sub">17</span>ClN<span class="Sub">6</span>O<span class="Sub">3</span>.  Eszopiclone has a single chiral center with an (<span class="Italics">S</span>)-configuration.  It has the following chemical structure:

</div>
<p>Eszopiclone is a white to light-yellow crystalline solid.  Eszopiclone is very slightly soluble in water, slightly soluble in ethanol, and soluble in phosphate buffer (pH 3.2).
</p>
<p>Eszopiclone is formulated as film-coated tablets for oral administration.  LUNESTA tablets contain 1 mg, 2 mg, or 3 mg eszopiclone and the following inactive ingredients:  calcium phosphate, colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, hypromellose, lactose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, titanium dioxide, and triacetin.  In addition, both the 1 mg and 3 mg tablets contain FD&amp;C Blue #2.

<h2>Pharmacodynamics
</h2>
<p class="First">The precise mechanism of action of eszopiclone as a hypnotic is unknown, but its effect is believed to result from its interaction with GABA-receptor complexes at binding domains located close to or allosterically coupled to benzodiazepine receptors.  Eszopiclone is a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic that is a pyrrolopyrazine derivative of the cyclopyrrolone class with a chemical structure unrelated to pyrazolopyrimidines, imidazopyridines, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or other drugs with known hypnotic properties.

<h2>Pharmacokinetics
</h2>
<p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of eszopiclone have been investigated in healthy subjects (adult and elderly) and in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>.  In healthy subjects, the pharmacokinetic profile was examined after single doses of up to 7.5 mg and after once-daily administration of 1, 3, and 6 mg for 7 days.  Eszopiclone is rapidly absorbed, with a time to peak concentration (t<span class="Sub">max</span>) of approximately 1 hour and a terminal-phase elimination half-life (t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>) of approximately 6 hours.  In healthy adults, LUNESTA does not accumulate with once-daily administration, and its exposure is dose-proportional over the range of 1 to 6 mg.
</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s7"></a><a name="section-2.2.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Absorption And Distribution
</h3>
<p class="First">Eszopiclone is rapidly absorbed following oral administration.  Peak plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately 1 hour after oral administration.  Eszopiclone is weakly bound to plasma protein (52-59%).  The large free fraction suggests that eszopiclone disposition should not be affected by drug-drug interactions caused by protein binding.  The blood-to-plasma ratio for eszopiclone is less than one, indicating no selective uptake by red blood cells.

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s8"></a><a name="section-2.2.2"></a><p></p>
<h3>Metabolism
</h3>
<p class="First">Following oral administration, eszopiclone is extensively metabolized by oxidation and demethylation.  The primary plasma metabolites are (<span class="Italics">S</span>)-zopiclone-N-oxide and (<span class="Italics">S</span>)-N-desmethyl zopiclone; the latter compound binds to GABA receptors with substantially lower potency than eszopiclone, and the former compound shows no significant binding to this receptor.  <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies have shown that CYP3A4 and CYP2E1 enzymes are involved in the metabolism of eszopiclone.  Eszopiclone did not show any inhibitory potential on CYP450 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4 in cryopreserved human hepatocytes.

<a name="s9"></a><a name="section-2.2.3"></a><p></p>
<h3>Elimination
</h3>
<p class="First">After oral administration, eszopiclone is eliminated with a mean t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> of approximately 6 hours.  Up to 75% of an oral dose of racemic zopiclone is excreted in the urine, primarily as metabolites.  A similar excretion profile would be expected for eszopiclone, the S-isomer of racemic zopiclone.  Less than 10% of the orally administered eszopiclone dose is excreted in the urine as parent drug.

<a name="s10"></a><a name="section-2.2.4"></a><p></p>
<h3>Effect Of Food
</h3>
<p class="First">In healthy adults, administration of a 3 mg dose of eszopiclone after a high-fat meal resulted in no change in AUC, a reduction in mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> of 21%, and delayed t<span class="Sub">max</span> by approximately 1 hour.  The half-life remained unchanged, approximately 6 hours.  The effects of LUNESTA on sleep onset may be reduced if it is taken with or immediately after a high-fat/heavy meal.

<h3>Age
</h3>
<p class="First">Compared with non-elderly adults, subjects 65 years and older had an increase of 41% in total exposure (AUC) and a slightly prolonged elimination of eszopiclone (t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> approximately 9Â hours).  C<span class="Sub">max</span> was unchanged.  Therefore, in elderly patients the starting dose of LUNESTA should be decreased to 1 mg and the dose should not exceed 2 mg.

<h3><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic Impairment</span>
</h3>
<p class="First">Pharmacokinetics of a 2 mg eszopiclone dose were assessed in 16 healthy volunteers and in 8Â subjects with mild, moderate, and severe liver disease.  Exposure was increased 2-fold in severely impaired patients compared with the healthy volunteers.  C<span class="Sub">max</span> and t<span class="Sub">max</span> were unchanged.  The dose of LUNESTA should not be increased above 2 mg in patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>.  No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild-to-moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>.  LUNESTA should be used with caution in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>.

<h2>Drug Interactions
</h2>
<p class="First">Eszopiclone is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2E1 via demethylation and oxidation.  There were no pharmacokinetic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacodynamic interactions</span> between eszopiclone and paroxetine, digoxin, or warfarin.  When eszopiclone was coadministered with olanzapine, no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interaction</span> was detected in levels of eszopiclone or olanzapine, but a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacodynamic interaction</span> was seen on a measure of psychomotor function.  Eszopiclone and lorazepam decreased each other's C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 22%.  Coadministration of eszopiclone 3 mg to subjects receiving ketoconazole 400 mg, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, resulted in a 2.2-fold increase in exposure to eszopiclone.  LUNESTA would not be expected to alter the clearance of drugs metabolized by common CYP450 enzymes.  (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#s30">PRECAUTIONS</a>.</span>)

<h2>Clinical Trials:
</h2>
<p class="First">The effect of LUNESTA on reducing sleep latency and improving sleep maintenance was established in studies with 2100 subjects (ages 18-86) with chronic and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">transient insomnia</span> in six placebo-controlled trials of up to 6 months' duration.  Two of these trials were in elderly patients (n=523).  Overall, at the recommended adult dose (2-3 mg) and elderly dose (1-2 mg), LUNESTA significantly decreased sleep latency and improved measures of sleep maintenance (objectively measured as wake time after sleep onset [WASO] and subjectively measured as total sleep time).

<h3>Adults
</h3>
<p class="First">In the first study, adults with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">chronic insomnia</span> (n=308) were evaluated in a double-blind, parallel-group trial of 6 weeks' duration comparing LUNESTA 2 mg and 3 mg with placebo.  Objective endpoints were measured for 4 weeks.  Both 2 mg and 3 mg were superior to placebo on LPS at 4 weeks.  The 3 mg dose was superior to placebo on WASO.
</p>
<p>In the second study, adults with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">chronic insomnia</span> (n=788) were evaluated using subjective measures in a double-blind, parallel-group trial comparing the safety and efficacy of LUNESTA 3Â mg with placebo administered nightly for 6 months.  LUNESTA was superior to placebo on subjective measures of sleep latency, total sleep time, and WASO.
</p>
<p>In addition, a 6-period cross-over PSG study evaluating eszopiclone doses of 1 to 3 mg, each given over a 2-day period, demonstrated effectiveness of all doses on LPS, and of 3 mg on WASO.  In this trial, the response was dose-related.

<a name="s24"></a><a name="section-2.8.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Cognitive, Memory, Sedative, and Psychomotor Effects
</h3>
<p class="First">In two double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose cross-over studies of 12 patients each (one study in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>; one in normal volunteers), the effects of LUNESTA 2 and 3 mg were assessed on 20 measures of cognitive function and memory at 9.5 and 12 hours after a nighttime dose.  Although results suggested that patients receiving LUNESTA 3 mg performed more poorly than patients receiving placebo on a very small number of these measures at 9.5 hours post-dose, no consistent pattern of abnormalities was seen.
</p>
<p>In a 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of nightly administered LUNESTA 3 mg, 8/593 subjects treated with LUNESTA 3 mg (1.3%) and 0/195 subjects treated with placebo (0%) spontaneously reported <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4304008" conceptname="Memory impairment">memory impairment</span>.  The majority of these events were mild in nature (5/8), and none were reported as severe.  Four of these events occurred within the first 7 days of treatment and did not recur.  The incidence of spontaneously reported <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> in this 6-month study was 0.5% in both treatment arms.  In a 6-week adult study of nightly administered LUNESTA 2 mg or 3 mg or placebo, the spontaneous reporting rates for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> were 0%, 3.0%, and 0%, respectively, and for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4304008" conceptname="Memory impairment">memory impairment</span> were 1%, 1%, and 0%, respectively.
</p>
<p>In a 2-week study of 264 elderly insomniacs randomized to either nightly LUNESTA 2 mg or placebo, spontaneous reporting rates of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4304008" conceptname="Memory impairment">memory impairment</span> were 0% vs. 0.8% and 1.5% vs. 0%, respectively.  In another 2-week study of 231 elderly insomniacs, the spontaneous reporting rates for the 1 mg, 2 mg, and placebo groups for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> were 0%, 2.5%, and 0%, respectively, and for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4304008" conceptname="Memory impairment">memory impairment</span> were 1.4%, 0%, and 0%, respectively.
</p>
<p>A study of normal subjects exposed to single fixed doses of LUNESTA from 1 to 7.5 mg using the DSST to assess sedation and psychomotor function at fixed times after dosing (hourly up to 16 hours) found the expected sedation and reduction in psychomotor function.  This was maximal at 1 hour and present up to 4 hours, but was no longer present by 5 hours.
</p>
<p>In another study, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> were given 2 or 3 mg doses of LUNESTA nightly, with DSST assessed on the mornings following days 1, 15, and 29 of treatment.  While both the placebo and LUNESTA 3 mg groups showed an improvement in DSST scores relative to baseline the following morning (presumably due to a learning effect), the improvement in the placebo group was greater and reached statistical significance on night 1, although not on nights 15 and 29.  For the LUNESTA 2 mg group, DSST change scores were not significantly different from placebo at any time point.

</h3>
<p class="First">During nightly use for an extended period, pharmacodynamic tolerance or adaptation has been observed with other hypnotics.  If a drug has a short elimination half-life, it is possible that a relative deficiency of the drug or its active metabolites (i.e., in relationship to the receptor site) may occur at some point in the interval between each night's use.  This is believed to be responsible for two clinical findings reported to occur after several weeks of nightly use of other rapidly eliminated hypnotics:  increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4100068" conceptname="Wakefulness">wakefulness</span> during the last quarter of the night and the appearance of increased signs of daytime <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>.
</p>
<p>In a 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled study of nightly administration of LUNESTA 3Â mg, rates of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> reported as an adverse event were 2.1% in the placebo arm and 3.7% in the LUNESTA arm.  In a 6-week adult study of nightly administration, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> was reported as an adverse event in 0%, 2.9%, and 1.0% of the placebo, 2 mg, and 3 mg treatment arms, respectively.  In this study, single-blind placebo was administered on nights 45 and 46, the first and second days of withdrawal from study drug.  New adverse events were recorded during the withdrawal period, beginning with day 45, up to 14 days after discontinuation.  During this withdrawal period, 105 subjects previously taking nightly LUNESTA 3 mg for 44 nights spontaneously reported <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> (1%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4304251" conceptname="Bizarre dreams">abnormal dreams</span> (1.9%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4031840" conceptname="Hyperesthesia">hyperesthesia</span> (1%), and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="444243" conceptname="Neurosis">neurosis</span> (1%), while none of 99 subjects previously taking placebo reported any of these adverse events during the withdrawal period.

Rebound <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> following discontinuation of LUNESTA relative to placebo and baseline was examined objectively in a 6-week adult study on the first 2 nights of discontinuation (nights 45 and 46) following 44 nights of active treatment with 2 mg or 3 mg.  In the LUNESTA 2 mg group, compared with baseline, there was a significant increase in WASO and a decrease in sleep efficiency, both occurring only on the first night after discontinuation of treatment.  No changes from baseline were noted in the LUNESTA 3 mg group on the first night after discontinuation, and there was a significant improvement in LPS and sleep efficiency compared with baseline following the second night of discontinuation.  Comparisons of changes from baseline between LUNESTA and placebo were also performed.  On the first night after discontinuation of LUNESTA 2 mg, LPS and WASO were significantly increased and sleep efficiency was reduced; there were no significant differences on the second night.  On the first night following discontinuation of LUNESTA 3 mg, sleep efficiency was significantly reduced.  No other differences from placebo were noted in any other sleep parameter on either the first or second night following discontinuation.  For both doses, the discontinuation-emergent effect was mild, had the characteristics of the return of the symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">chronic insomnia</span>, and appeared to resolve by the second night after LUNESTA discontinuation.

Some of these changes may be characterized by decreased inhibition (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021344" conceptname="Abusive behavior">aggressiveness</span> and extroversion that seem out of character), similar to effects produced by alcohol and other CNS depressants.  Other reported behavioral changes have included <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4092397" conceptname="Bizarre behavior">bizarre behavior</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4085688" conceptname="Loss of identity">depersonalization</span>.  Complex behaviors such as â€œsleep-drivingâ€? (i.e., driving while not fully awake after ingestion of a sedative-hypnotic, with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439147" conceptname="Amnesia">amnesia</span> for the event) have been reported.  These events can occur in sedative-hypnotic-naÃ¯ve as well as in sedative-hypnotic-experienced persons.  Although behaviors such as sleep-driving may occur with LUNESTA alone at therapeutic doses, the use of alcohol and other CNS depressants with LUNESTA appears to increase the risk of such behaviors, as does the use of LUNESTA at doses exceeding the maximum recommended dose.  Due to the risk to the patient and the community, discontinuation of LUNESTA should be strongly considered for patients who report a â€œsleep-drivingâ€? episode.  Other complex behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have been reported in patients who are not fully awake after taking a sedative-hypnotic.  As with sleep-driving, patients usually do not remember these events.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439147" conceptname="Amnesia">Amnesia</span> and other neuropsychiatric symptoms may occur unpredictably.  In primarily depressed patients, worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, including suicidal thoughts and actions (including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">completed suicides</span>), have been reported in association with the use of sedative/hypnotics.
</p>
<p>It can rarely be determined with certainty whether a particular instance of the abnormal behaviors listed above are drug-induced, spontaneous in origin, or a result of an underlying psychiatric or physical disorder.  Nonetheless, the emergence of any new behavioral sign or symptom of concern requires careful and immediate evaluation.
</p>
<p>Following rapid dose decrease or abrupt discontinuation of the use of sedative/hypnotics, there have been reports of signs and symptoms similar to those associated with withdrawal from other CNS-depressant drugs (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s60">DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></a></span>).
</p>
<p>LUNESTA, like other hypnotics, has CNS-depressant effects.  <span class="Underline">Because of the rapid onset of action, LUNESTA should only be ingested immediately prior to going to bed or after the patient has gone to bed and has experienced difficulty <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falling</span> asleep.</span>  Patients receiving LUNESTA should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness or motor coordination (e.g., operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle) after ingesting the drug, and be cautioned about potential impairment of the performance of such activities on the day following ingestion of LUNESTA.  LUNESTA, like other hypnotics, may produce additive CNS-depressant effects when coadministered with other psychotropic medications, anticonvulsants, antihistamines, ethanol, and other drugs that themselves produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span>.  LUNESTA should not be taken with alcohol.  Dose adjustment may be necessary when LUNESTA is administered with other CNS-depressant agents, because of the potentially additive effects.

<h2>Use In The Elderly And/Or Debilitated Patients
</h2>
<p class="First">Impaired motor and/or cognitive performance after repeated exposure or unusual sensitivity to sedative/hypnotic drugs is a concern in the treatment of elderly and/or debilitated patients.  The recommended starting dose of LUNESTA for these patients is 1 mg.  (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#s69">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>.</span>)
</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s34"></a><a name="section-6.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Use In Patients With Concomitant Illness
</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical experience with eszopiclone in patients with concomitant illness is limited.  Eszopiclone should be used with caution in patients with diseases or conditions that could affect metabolism or hemodynamic responses.
</p>
<p>A study in healthy volunteers did not reveal respiratory-depressant effects at doses 2.5-fold higher (7 mg) than the recommended dose of eszopiclone.  Caution is advised, however, if LUNESTA is prescribed to patients with compromised respiratory function.
</p>
<p>The dose of LUNESTA should be reduced to 1 mg in patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>, because systemic exposure is doubled in such subjects.  No dose adjustment appears necessary for subjects with mild or moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>.  No dose adjustment appears necessary in subjects with any degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, since less than 10% of eszopiclone is excreted unchanged in the urine.
</p>
<p>The dose of LUNESTA should be reduced in patients who are administered potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole, while taking LUNESTA.  Downward dose adjustment is also recommended when LUNESTA is administered with agents having known CNS-depressant effects.

<h2>SPECIAL CONCERNS â€œSleep-Drivingâ€? and other complex behaviors
</h2>
<p class="First">There have been reports of people getting out of bed after taking a sedative-hypnotic and driving their cars while not fully awake, often with no memory of the event.  If a patient experiences such an episode, it should be reported to his or her doctor immediately, since â€œsleep-drivingâ€? can be dangerous.  This behavior is more likely to occur when LUNESTA is taken with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants (see <a href="#s28">WARNINGS</a>).  Other complex behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have been reported in patients who are not fully awake after taking a sedative-hypnotic.  As with sleep-driving, patients usually do not remember these events.

<h3>Drugs That Inhibit CYP3A4 (Ketoconazole)
</h3>
<p class="First">CYP3A4 is a major metabolic pathway for elimination of eszopiclone.  The AUC of eszopiclone was increased 2.2-fold by coadministration of ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, 400Â mg daily for 5 days.  C<span class="Sub">max</span> and t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> were increased 1.4-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively.  Other strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, troleandomycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir) would be expected to behave similarly.

<h3>Drugs Highly Bound To Plasma Protein
</h3>
<p class="First">Eszopiclone is not highly bound to plasma proteins (52-59% bound); therefore, the disposition of eszopiclone is not expected to be sensitive to alterations in protein binding.  Administration of eszopiclone 3 mg to a patient taking another drug that is highly protein-bound would not be expected to cause an alteration in the free concentration of either drug.

<h3>Carcinogenesis
</h3>
<p class="First">In a carcinogenicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats in which eszopiclone was given by oral gavage, no increases in tumors were seen; plasma levels (AUC) of eszopiclone at the highest dose used in this study (16 mg/kg/day) are estimated to be 80 (females) and 20 (males) times those in humans receiving the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD).  However, in a carcinogenicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats in which racemic zopiclone was given in the diet, and in which plasma levels of eszopiclone were reached that were greater than those reached in the above study of eszopiclone, an increase in mammary gland adenocarcinomas in females and an increase in thyroid gland follicular cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> and carcinomas in males were seen at the highest dose of 100 mg/kg/day.  Plasma levels of eszopiclone at this dose are estimated to be 150 (females) and 70 (males) times those in humans receiving the MRHD.  The mechanism for the increase in mammary adenocarcinomas is unknown.  The increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030041" conceptname="Thyroid nodule">thyroid tumors</span> is thought to be due to increased levels of TSH secondary to increased metabolism of circulating thyroid hormones, a mechanism that is not considered to be relevant to humans.
</p>
<p>In a carcinogenicity study in B6C3F1 mice in which racemic zopiclone was given in the diet, an increase in pulmonary carcinomas and carcinomas plus <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> in females and an increase in skin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012174" conceptname="Fibroma">fibromas</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084784" conceptname="Sarcoma">sarcomas</span> in males were seen at the highest dose of 100 mg/kg/day.  Plasma levels of eszopiclone at this dose are estimated to be 8 (females) and 20 (males) times those in humans receiving the MRHD.  The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135777" conceptname="Neoplasm of uncertain behavior of skin">skin tumors</span> were due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4316083" conceptname="Skin lesion">skin lesions</span> induced by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021344" conceptname="Abusive behavior">aggressive behavior</span>, a mechanism that is not relevant to humans.  A carcinogenicity study was also performed in which CD-1 mice were given eszopiclone at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day by oral gavage; although this study did not reach a maximum tolerated dose, and was thus inadequate for overall assessment of carcinogenic potential, no increases in either pulmonary or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135777" conceptname="Neoplasm of uncertain behavior of skin">skin tumors</span> were seen at doses producing plasma levels of eszopiclone estimated to be 90 times those in humans receiving the MRHD â€” i.e., 12 times the exposure in the racemate study.

<p>Eszopiclone did not increase tumors in a p53 transgenic mouse bioassay at oral doses up to 300Â mg/kg/day.

<h3>Impairment Of Fertility
</h3>
<p class="First">Eszopiclone was given by oral gavage to male rats at doses up to 45 mg/kg/day from 4 weeks premating through mating and to female rats at doses up to 180 mg/kg/day from 2 weeks premating through day 7 of pregnancy.  An additional study was performed in which only females were treated, up to 180 mg/kg/day.  Eszopiclone decreased fertility, probably because of effects in both males and females, with no females becoming pregnant when both males and females were treated with the highest dose; the no-effect dose in both sexes was 5 mg/kg (16 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).  Other effects included increased pre-implantation loss (no-effect dose 25 mg/kg), abnormal estrus cycles (no-effect dose 25 mg/kg), and decreases in sperm number and motility and increases in morphologically abnormal sperm (no-effect dose 5 mg/kg).

In the rat, slight reductions in fetal weight and evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436077" conceptname="Developmental delay">developmental delay</span> were seen at maternally toxic doses of 125 and 150 mg/kg/day, but not at 62.5 mg/kg/day (200 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).
</p>
<p>Eszopiclone was also administered by oral gavage to pregnant rats throughout the pregnancy and lactation periods at doses of up to 180 mg/kg/day.  Increased post-implantation loss, decreased postnatal pup weights and survival, and increased pup startle response were seen at all doses; the lowest dose tested, 60 mg/kg/day, is 200 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.  These doses did not produce significant maternal toxicity.  Eszopiclone had no effects on other behavioral measures or reproductive function in the offspring.
</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of eszopiclone in pregnant women.  Eszopiclone should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS:
</h1>
<p class="First">The premarketing development program for LUNESTA included eszopiclone exposures in patients and/or normal subjects from two different groups of studies:  approximately 400 normal subjects in clinical pharmacology/pharmacokinetic studies, and approximately 1550 patients in placebo-controlled clinical effectiveness studies, corresponding to approximately 263 patient-exposure years.  The conditions and duration of treatment with LUNESTA varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) open-label and double-blind phases of studies, inpatients and outpatients, and short-term and longer-term exposure.  Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse events, results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analyses, and ECGs.
</p>
<p>Adverse events during exposure were obtained primarily by general inquiry and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing.  Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of events into a smaller number of standardized event categories.  In the tables and tabulations that follow, COSTART terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events.
</p>
<p>The stated frequencies of adverse events represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse event of the type listed.  An event was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while the patient was receiving therapy following baseline evaluation.

<p class="First">In placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trials in the elderly, 3.8% of 208 patients who received placebo, 2.3% of 215 patients who received 2Â mg LUNESTA, and 1.4% of 72 patients who received 1 mg LUNESTA discontinued treatment due to an adverse event.  In the 6-week parallel-group study in adults, no patients in the 3Â mg arm discontinued because of an adverse event.  In the long-term 6-month study in adult <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> patients, 7.2% of 195 patients who received placebo and 12.8% of 593Â patients who received 3 mg LUNESTA discontinued due to an adverse event.  No event that resulted in discontinuation occurred at a rate of greater than 2%.

<p>These figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice because patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials.  Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators.  The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contributions of drug and non-drug factors to the adverse event incidence rate in the population studied.

<h2>Other Events Observed During The Premarketing Evaluation Of LUNESTA
</h2>
<p class="First">Following is a list of modified COSTART terms that reflect treatment-emergent adverse events as defined in the introduction to the <span class="Bold"><a href="#s55">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span> section and reported by approximately 1550 subjects treated with LUNESTA at doses in the range of 1 to 3.5Â mg/day during Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials throughout the United States and Canada.  All reported events are included except those already listed in <a href="#t1">Tables 1</a> and <a href="#t2">2</a> or elsewhere in labeling, minor events common in the general population, and events unlikely to be drug-related.  Although the events reported occurred during treatment with LUNESTA, they were not necessarily caused by it.
</p>
<p>Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions:  <span class="Bold">frequent</span> adverse events are those that occurred on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients; <span class="Bold">infrequent</span> adverse events are those that occurred in fewer than 1/100 patients but in at least 1/1,000 patients; <span class="Bold">rare</span> adverse events are those that occurred in fewer than 1/1,000 patients.  Gender-specific events are categorized based on their incidence for the appropriate gender.

<h2>Controlled Substance Class
</h2>
<p class="First">LUNESTA is a Schedule IV controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act.  Other substances under the same classification are benzodiazepines and the nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics zaleplon and zolpidem.  While eszopiclone is a hypnotic agent with a chemical structure unrelated to benzodiazepines, it shares some of the pharmacologic properties of the benzodiazepines.

</h2>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34086-9">

<h3>Abuse And <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">Dependence</span>
</h3>
<p class="First">Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> and tolerance.  Abuse is characterized by misuse of the drug for non-medical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances.  Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> is a state of adaptation that is manifested by a specific withdrawal syndrome that can be produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, decreasing blood level of the drug and/or administration of an antagonist.  Tolerance is a state of adaptation in which exposure to a drug induces changes that result in a diminution of one or more of the drug's effects over time.  Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs and may develop at different rates for different effects.
</p>
<p>Addiction is a primary, chronic, neurobiological disease with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations.  It is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following:  impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug addiction</span> is a treatable disease, utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common.
</p>
<p>In a study of abuse liability conducted in individuals with known histories of benzodiazepine abuse, eszopiclone at doses of 6 and 12 mg produced euphoric effects similar to those of diazepam 20 mg.  In this study, at doses 2-fold or greater than the maximum recommended doses, a dose-related increase in reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439147" conceptname="Amnesia">amnesia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span> was observed for both LUNESTA and diazepam.
</p>
<p>The clinical trial experience with LUNESTA revealed no evidence of a serious withdrawal syndrome.  Nevertheless, the following adverse events included in DSM-IV criteria for uncomplicated sedative/hypnotic withdrawal were reported during clinical trials following placebo substitution occurring within 48 hours following the last LUNESTA treatment: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4304251" conceptname="Bizarre dreams">abnormal dreams</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012224" conceptname="Upset stomach">upset stomach</span>.  These reported adverse events occurred at an incidence of 2% or less.  Use of benzodiazepines and similar agents may lead to physical and psychological <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>.  The risk of abuse and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> increases with the dose and duration of treatment and concomitant use of other psychoactive drugs.  The risk is also greater for patients who have a history of alcohol or drug abuse or history of psychiatric disorders.  These patients should be under careful surveillance when receiving LUNESTA or any other hypnotic.

<h3>Tolerance
</h3>
<p class="First">Some loss of efficacy to the hypnotic effect of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like agents may develop after repeated use of these drugs for a few weeks.
</p>
<p>No development of tolerance to any parameter of sleep measurement was observed over six months.  Tolerance to the efficacy of LUNESTA 3 mg was assessed by 4-week objective and 6-week subjective measurements of time to sleep onset and sleep maintenance for LUNESTA in a placebo-controlled 44-day study, and by subjective assessments of time to sleep onset and WASO in a placebo-controlled study for 6 months.

<h1>OVERDOSAGE:
</h1>
<p class="First">There is limited premarketing clinical experience with the effects of an overdosage of LUNESTA.  In clinical trials with eszopiclone, one case of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> with up to 36 mg of eszopiclone was reported in which the subject fully recovered.  Individuals have fully recovered from racemic zopiclone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> up to 340 mg (56 times the maximum recommended dose of eszopiclone).

<h2>Signs And Symptoms
</h2>
<p class="First">Signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> effects of CNS depressants can be expected to present as exaggerations of the pharmacological effects noted in preclinical testing.

<h2>Recommended Treatment
</h2>
<p class="First">General symptomatic and supportive measures should be used along with immediate gastric lavage where appropriate.  Intravenous fluids should be administered as needed.  Flumazenil may be useful.  As in all cases of drug <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, respiration, pulse, blood pressure, and other appropriate signs should be monitored and general supportive measures employed.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span> should be monitored and treated by appropriate medical intervention.

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:
</h1>
<p class="First">The dose of LUNESTA should be individualized.  The recommended starting dose for LUNESTA for most non-elderly adults is 2 mg immediately before bedtime.  Dosing can be initiated at or raised to 3 mg if clinically indicated, since 3 mg is more effective for sleep maintenance (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s30">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>).
</p>
<p>The recommended starting dose of LUNESTA for elderly patients whose primary complaint is difficulty <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falling</span> asleep is 1 mg immediately before bedtime.  In these patients, the dose may be increased to 2 mg if clinically indicated.  For elderly patients whose primary complaint is difficulty staying asleep, the recommended dose is 2 mg immediately before bedtime (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s30">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>).
</p>
<p>Taking LUNESTA with or immediately after a heavy, high-fat meal results in slower absorption and would be expected to reduce the effect of LUNESTA on sleep latency (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s6">Pharmacokinetics</a></span> under <span class="Bold"><a href="#s4">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span>).
