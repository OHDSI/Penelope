<h1>Clinical Pharmacology</h1>
<p class="First">BUTISOL SODIUM<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (butabarbital sodium tablets, USP and butabarbital sodium oral solution, USP), like other barbiturates, is capable of producing all levels of CNS mood alteration from excitation to mild sedation, to hypnosis, and deep <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>. Overdosage can produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. Barbiturates depress the sensory cortex, decrease motor activity, alter cerebellar function, and produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, sedation, and hypnosis.</p>
<p>Barbiturate-induced sleep differs from physiological sleep. Sleep laboratory studies have demonstrated that barbiturates reduce the amount of time spent in the rapid eye movement (REM) phase of sleep or dreaming stage. Also, Stages III and IV sleep are decreased. Following abrupt cessation of barbiturates used regularly, patients may experience markedly increased dreaming, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4009184" conceptname="Dream anxiety disorder">nightmares</span>, and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>. Therefore, withdrawal of a single therapeutic dose over 5 or 6 days has been recommended to lessen the REM rebound and disturbed sleep which contribute to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441260" conceptname="Drug withdrawal">drug withdrawal syndrome</span> (for example, decrease the dose from 3 to 2 doses a day for 1 week). </p>
<p>In studies, secobarbital sodium and pentobarbital sodium have been found to lose most of their effectiveness for both inducing and maintaining sleep by the end of 2 weeks of continued drug administration even with the use of multiple doses. As with secobarbital sodium and pentobarbital sodium, other barbiturates might be expected to lose their effectiveness for inducing and maintaining sleep after about 2 weeks. The short-, intermediate-, and, to a lesser degree, long-acting barbiturates have been widely prescribed for treating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>. Although the clinical literature abounds with claims that the short-acting barbiturates are superior for producing sleep while the intermediate-acting compounds are more effective in maintaining sleep, controlled studies have failed to demonstrate these differential effects. Therefore, as sleep medications, the barbiturates are of limited value beyond short-term use. </p>
<p>Barbiturates are respiratory depressants. The degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> is dependent upon dose. With hypnotic doses, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> produced by barbiturates is similar to that which occurs during physiologic sleep with slight decrease in blood pressure and heart rate.</p>
<p>Barbiturates do not impair normal hepatic function, but have been shown to induce liver microsomal enzymes, thus increasing and/or altering the metabolism of barbiturates and other drugs (see <a href="#MKL64F4-948J-749M-JF57-A612IM34B79">Precautions-</a><span class="Italics"><a href="#MKL64F4-948J-749M-JF57-A612IM34B79">Drug interactions</a></span>).</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pharmacokinetics: </span>BUTISOL SODIUM<span class="Sup">Â® </span>(butabarbital sodium tablets, USP and butabarbital sodium oral solution, USP) is the sodium salt of a weak acid. Barbiturates are weak acids that are absorbed and rapidly distributed to all tissues and fluids with high concentrations in the brain, liver, and kidneys. Barbiturates are bound to plasma and tissue proteins. The rate of absorption is increased if it is ingested as a dilute solution or taken on an empty stomach. </p>
<p>Barbiturates are metabolized primarily by the hepatic microsomal enzyme system, and most metabolic products are excreted in the urine. The excretion of unchanged butabarbital in the urine is negligible. BUTISOL SODIUM<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (butabarbital sodium tablets, USP and butabarbital sodium oral solution, USP) is classified as an intermediate-acting barbiturate. The average plasma half-life for butabarbital is 100 hours in the adult. </p>
<p>Although variable from patient to patient, butabarbital has an onset of action of about 3/4 to 1 hour, and a duration of action of about 6 to 8 hours. </p>

<h1>Indications and Usage</h1>
<p class="First">BUTISOL SODIUM<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (butabarbital sodium tablets, USP and butabarbital sodium oral solution, USP) is indicated for use as a sedative or hypnotic. </p>
<p>Since barbiturates appear to lose their effectiveness for sleep induction and sleep maintenance after 2 weeks, use of BUTISOL SODIUM<span class="Sup">Â® </span>in treating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> should be limited to this time (see <a href="#CF648TBD-616E-426F-9EFD-A612IM34B79L">Clinical Pharmacology</a> above). </p>

<h1>Contraindications</h1>
<p class="First">Barbiturates are contraindicated in patients with known barbiturate sensitivity.

<h1>Warnings</h1>
<p class="First">Because <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435524" conceptname="Sleep disorder">sleep disturbances</span> may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and/or psychiatric disorder, symptomatic treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> should be initiated only after a careful evaluation of the patient. <span class="Italics">The failure of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated. </span></p>
<p>Worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> or the emergence of new thinking or behavior abnormalities may be the consequences of an unrecognized psychiatric or physical disorder. Such findings have emerged during the course of treatment with sedative-hypnotic drugs. Because some of the important adverse effects of sedative-hypnotics appear to be dose related (see <a href="#MKM9K64-958J-749M-KM73-A612IM34B79">PRECAUTIONS</a>  and <a href="#F25BE9D3-DF2E-48AE-9B46-0EED4F7B2284">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>), it is important to use the smallest possible effective dose, especially in the elderly.</p>
<p>Complex behaviors such as â€œsleep drivingâ€? (i.e., driving while not fully awake after ingestion of a sedative-hypnotic, with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439147" conceptname="Amnesia">amnesia</span> for the event) have been reported. These events can occur in sedative-hypnotic-naive as well as in sedative-hypnotic-experienced persons. Although behaviors such as sleep-driving may occur with sedative-hypnotics alone at therapeutic doses, the use of alcohol and other CNS depressants with sedative-hypnotics appears to increase the risk of such behaviors, as does the use of sedative-hypnotics at doses exceeding the maximum recommended dose. Due to the risk to the patient and the community, discontinuation of sedative-hypnotics should be strongly considered for patients who report a â€œsleep drivingâ€? episodeâ€?.</p>
<p>Other complex behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have been reported in patients who are not fully awake after taking a sedative-hypnotic. As with sleep-driving, patients usually do not remember these events. </p>

To minimize the possibility of overdosage or the development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>, the prescribing and dispensing of sedative-hypnotic barbiturates should be limited to the amount required for the interval until the next appointment.

<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Use in pregnancy:</span> Barbiturates can cause fetal damage when administered to a pregnant woman. Retrospective, case-controlled studies have suggested a connection between the maternal consumption of barbiturates and a higher than expected incidence of fetal abnormalities. Following oral administration, barbiturates readily cross the placental barrier and are distributed throughout fetal tissues with highest concentrations found in the placenta, fetal liver, and brain.</p>
<p>Withdrawal symptoms occur in infants born to mothers who receive barbiturates throughout the last trimester of pregnancy (See <a href="#C09E85B1-05B4-41E6-854F-FDFAF3E4D006">Drug Abuse and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">Dependence</span></a>). If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.

<p class="First"><span class="Italics">General:</span> Barbiturates should be administered with caution, if at all, to patients who are mentally depressed, have suicidal tendencies, or a history of drug abuse.</p>
<p>Elderly or debilitated patients may react to barbiturates with marked <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">excitement</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>.

<p class="First"><span class="Italics">â€œSleep Drivingâ€? and other complex behaviors:</span> There have been reports of people getting out of bed after taking a sedative-hypnotic and driving their cars while not fully awake, often with no memory of the event. If a patient experiences such an episode, it should be reported to his or her doctor immediately, since â€œsleep drivingâ€? can be dangerous. This behavior is more likely to occur when sedative-hypnotics are taken with alcohol or other central nervous depressants (see <a href="#MK844MBD-616E-749M-9EFD-A612IM34B79"> WARNINGS</a>). Other complex behaviors (e.g. preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have been reported in patients who are not fully awake after taking a sedative-hypnotic. As with sleep-driving, patients usually do not remember these events.</p>
<p>The use of barbiturates carries with it an associated risk of psychological and/or physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>. The patient should be warned against increasing the dose of the drug without consulting a physician. </p>
<p>Barbiturates may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving or operating machinery. </p>
<p>Alcohol should not be consumed while taking barbiturates. Concurrent use of the barbiturates with other CNS depressants, including other sedatives or hypnotics, alcohol, narcotics, tranquilizers, and antihistamines, may result in additional CNS depressant effects. </p>

<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Drug interactions:</span> Most reports of clinically significant drug interactions occurring with the barbiturates have involved phenobarbital. However, the application of these data to other barbiturates appears valid and warrants serial blood level determinations of the relevant drugs when there are multiple therapies. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<span class="Italics">Anticoagulants.</span> Phenobarbital lowers the plasma levels of dicumarol and causes a decrease in anticoagulant activity as measured by the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time. Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon). Patients stabilized on anticoagulant therapy may require dosage adjustments if barbiturates are added to or withdrawn from their dosage regimen.</li>
<li>
<span class="Italics">Corticosteroids.</span> Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes. Patients stabilized on corticosteroid therapy may require dosage adjustments if barbiturates are added to or withdrawn from their dosage regimen.</li>
<li>
<span class="Italics">Griseofulvin.</span> Phenobarbital appears to interfere with the absorption of orally administered griseofulvin, thus decreasing its blood level. The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established. However, it would be preferable to avoid concomitant administration of these drugs.</li>
<li>
<span class="Italics">Doxycycline.</span> Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued. This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic. If phenobarbital and doxycycline are administered concurrently, the clinical response to doxycycline should be monitored closely.</li>
<li>
<span class="Italics">Phenytoin, sodium valproate, valproic acid.</span> The effect of barbiturates on the metabolism of phenytoin appears to be variable. Some investigators report an accelerating effect, while others report no effect. Because the effect of barbiturates on the metabolism of phenytoin is not predictable, phenytoin and barbiturate blood levels should be monitored more frequently if these drugs are given concurrently. Sodium valproate and valproic acid appear to decrease barbiturate metabolism; therefore, barbiturate blood levels should be monitored and appropriate dosage adjustments made as indicated.</li>
<li>
<span class="Italics">Central nervous system.</span> The concomitant use of other central nervous system depressants, including other sedatives or hypnotics, antihistamines, tranquilizers, or alcohol, may produce additive depressant effects.</li>
<li>
<span class="Italics">Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI).</span> MAOI prolong the effects of barbiturates probably because metabolism of the barbiturate is inhibited.</li>
<li>
<span class="Italics"> Estradiol, estrone, progesterone, and other steroid hormones.</span> Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism. There have been reports of patients treated with antiepileptic drugs (e.g., phenobarbital) who become pregnant while taking oral contraceptives. An alternate contraceptive method might be suggested to women taking phenobarbital.</li>

<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Abuse and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>: </span>Abuse  and addiction are separate and distinct from physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> and tolerance. Abuse is characterized by misuse of the drug for non-medical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> is a state of adaptation that is manifested by a specific withdrawal syndrome that can be produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, decreasing blood level of the drug and/or administration of an antagonist. Tolerance is a state of adaptation in which exposure to a  drug induces changes that result in a diminution of one or more of the drugâ€™s effects over time. Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs and may develop at different rates for different effects.</p>
<p>Addiction is a primary, chronic, neurobiological disease with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations. It is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following: impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug addiction</span> is a treatable disease, utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common.</p>
<p>Barbiturates may be habit-forming. Tolerance, psychological <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>, and physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> may occur especially following prolonged use of high doses of barbiturates. Daily administration in excess of 400 milligrams (mg) of pentobarbital or secobarbital for approximately 90 days is likely to produce some degree of physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>. A dosage of from 600 to 800 mg taken for at least 35 days is sufficient to produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218977" conceptname="Drug withdrawal seizure">withdrawal seizures</span>. The average daily dose for the barbiturate addict is usually about 1.5 grams. As tolerance to barbiturates developes, the amount needed to maintain the same level of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> increases; tolerance to a fatal dosage, however, does not increase more than two-fold. As this occurs, the margin between an intoxicating dosage and a fatal dosage becomes smaller. </p>
<p>Symptoms of acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> with barbiturates include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437643" conceptname="Abnormal gait">unsteady gait</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196636" conceptname="Dysarthria">slurred speech</span>, and sustained <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378165" conceptname="Nystagmus">nystagmus</span>. Mental signs of chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, poor judgment, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, and somatic complaints. Symptoms of barbiturate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> are similar to those of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435243" conceptname="Alcohol dependence">chronic alcoholism</span>. </p>
<p>If an individual appears to be intoxicated with alcohol to a degree that is radically disproportionate to the amount of alcohol in his or her blood, the use of barbiturates should be suspected. The lethal dose of a barbiturate is far less if alcohol is also ingested. </p>
<p>The symptoms of barbiturate withdrawal can be severe and may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. Minor withdrawal symptoms may appear 8 to 12 hours after the last dose of a barbiturate. These symptoms usually appear in the following order: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4247265" conceptname="Muscle twitch">muscle twitching</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span> of hands and fingers, progressive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">weakness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, distortion in visual perception, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span>.

Intensity of withdrawal symptoms gradually declines over a period of approximately 15 days. </p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug dependence</span> to barbiturates arises from repeated administration of a barbiturate or agent with barbiturate-like effect on a continuous basis, generally in amounts exceeding therapeutic dose levels. The characteristics of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">drug dependence</span> to barbiturates include: (a) a strong desire or need to continue taking the drug; (b) a tendency to increase the dose; (c) a psychic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> on the effects of the drug related to subjective and individual appreciation for those effects; and (d) a physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> on the effects of the drug requiring its presence for maintenance of homeostasis and resulting in a definite, characteristic, and self-limited abstinence syndrome when the drug is withdrawn. </p>
<p>Treatment of barbiturate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> consists of cautious and gradual withdrawal of the drug. Barbiturate-dependent patients can be withdrawn by using a number of different withdrawal regimens. In all cases, withdrawal takes an extended period of time. One method involves initiating treatment at the patient's regular dosage level, in 3 to 4 divided doses, and decreasing the daily dose by 10 percent if tolerated by the patient. </p>
<p>Infants physically dependent on barbiturates may be given phenobarbital 3 to 10 mg/kg/day. After withdrawal symptoms (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">hyperactivity</span>, disturbed sleep, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremors</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4313132" conceptname="Hyperreflexia">hyperreflexia</span>) are relieved, the dosage of phenobarbital should be gradually decreased and completely withdrawn over a 2- week period. </p>
