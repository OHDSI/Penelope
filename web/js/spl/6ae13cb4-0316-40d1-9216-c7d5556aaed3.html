<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"><a name="INV-1b7c1a08-181a-442b-aa5f-a426e4df0d64"></a>ISOPTIN (verapamil HCl) is a calcium ion influx inhibitor (slow channel blocker or calcium ion antagonist) that exerts its pharmacologic effects by modulating the influx of ionic calcium across the cell membrane of the arterial smooth muscle as well as in conductile and contractile myocardial cells.</p>
<p><a name="INV-95135f36-150b-4a7c-837f-55508882e345"></a><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></p>

<p><a name="INV-7820207e-f727-4b7a-897c-50e6255a5d2b"></a>ISOPTIN exerts antihypertensive effects by decreasing systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span>, usually without orthostatic decreases in blood pressure or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="444070" conceptname="Tachycardia">reflex tachycardia</span>; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span> (rate less than 50 beats/min) is uncommon (1.4%). During isometric or dynamic exercise ISOPTIN does not alter systolic cardiac function in patients with normal ventricular function. ISOPTIN does not alter total serum calcium levels. However, one report suggested that calcium levels above the normal range may alter the therapeutic effect of ISOPTIN.</p>
<p><a name="INV-fb75a68e-5ddf-4328-9bbe-fc5143baccf7"></a><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Other Pharmacological Actions of ISOPTIN Include the Following</span></span></p>
<p><a name="INV-4077aa04-f14f-40bc-91cb-9cfaf9774a66"></a>ISOPTIN (verapamil HCI) dilates the main coronary arteries and coronary arterioles, both in normal and ischemic regions, and is a potent inhibitor of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4127089" conceptname="Coronary artery spasm">coronary artery spasm</span>, whether spontaneous or ergonovine-induced. This property increases myocardial oxygen delivery in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4127089" conceptname="Coronary artery spasm">coronary artery spasm</span>, and is responsible for the effectiveness of ISOPTIN in vasospastic (Prinzmetal’s or variant) as well as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315296" conceptname="Preinfarction syndrome">unstable angina</span> at rest. Whether this effect plays any role in classical effort angina is not clear, but studies of exercise tolerance have not shown an increase in the maximum exercise rate-pressure product, a widely accepted measure of oxygen utilization. This suggests that, in general, relief of spasm or dilation of coronary arteries is not an important factor in classical angina.</p>
<p><a name="INV-db33daa6-3088-474a-a71d-e53372a96ae1"></a>ISOPTIN regularly reduces the total systemic resistance (afterload) against which the heart works both at rest and at a given level of exercise by dilating peripheral arterioles.</p>
<p><a name="INV-87714b8a-9ea7-4031-8a09-631ebf424856"></a>Electrical activity through the AV node depends, to a significant degree, upon calcium influx through the slow channel. By decreasing the influx of calcium, ISOPTIN prolongs the effective refractory period within the AV node and slows AV conduction in a rate related manner.</p>
<p><a name="INV-3fdcaae3-18db-4b06-a8a9-faf3488abc2c"></a>Normal sinus rhythm is usually not affected, but in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317302" conceptname="Sinus node dysfunction">sick sinus syndrome</span>, ISOPTIN may interfere with sinus node impulse generation and may induce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4210313" conceptname="Sinus arrest">sinus arrest</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4277903" conceptname="Sinoatrial block">sinoatrial block</span>.</p>

<p><a name="INV-7e7dcde2-e2fd-40c7-80e9-924f5f1965f9"></a>ISOPTIN does not alter the normal atrial action potential or intraventricular conduction time, but depresses amplitude, velocity of depolarization and conduction in depressed atrial fibers.  ISOPTIN may shorten the antegrade effective refractory period of accessory bypass tracts. Acceleration of ventricular rate and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437894" conceptname="Ventricular fibrillation">ventricular fibrillation</span> has been reported in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314665" conceptname="Atrial flutter">atrial flutter</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">atrial fibrillation</span> and a coexisting accessory AV pathway following administration of verapamil (see WARNINGS).</p>
<p><a name="INV-4a98fb79-dfb4-4816-9722-0fbce6df354a"></a>ISOPTIN has a local anesthetic action that is 1.6 times that of procaine on an equimolar basis.</p>
<p><a name="INV-0800bc38-f280-4287-9d09-8773f7c380c7"></a>It is not known whether this action is important at the doses used in man.</p>
<p><a name="INV-2b320297-20ca-4b0d-a64d-5afd17c28aaf"></a><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: </span>With the immediate release formulation, more than 90% of the orally administered dose of ISOPTIN is absorbed. Because of rapid biotransformation of verapamil during its first pass through the portal circulation, bioavailability ranges from 20% to 35%. Peak plasma concentrations are reached between 1 and 2 hours after oral administration. Chronic oral administration of 120 mg of ISOPTIN every 6 hours resulted in plasma levels of verapamil ranging from 125 to 400 ng/mL with higher values reported occasionally. A nonlinear correlation between the verapamil dose administered and verapamil plasma levels does exist.</p>
<p><a name="INV-b1183660-f5e4-409a-b866-c6006f11e09f"></a>In early dose titration with verapamil a relationship exists between verapamil plasma concentrations and the prolongation of the PR interval. However, during chronic administration this relationship may disappear. The mean elimination half-life in single dose studies ranged from 2.8 to 7.4 hours. In these same studies, after repetitive dosing, the half-life increased to a range from 4.5 to 12.0 hours (after less than 10 consecutive doses given 6 hours apart). Half-life of verapamil may increase during titration. No relationship has been established between the plasma concentration of verapamil and a reduction in blood pressure.</p>
<p><a name="INV-5ab947f7-e3a5-43fb-a176-3ed2cf366c98"></a>Aging may affect the pharmacokinetics of verapamil. Elimination half-life may be prolonged in the elderly.</p>
<p><a name="INV-fca3f063-9b84-4149-98dd-698e69ad3ba8"></a>In multiple dose studies under fasting conditions the bioavailability measured by AUC of ISOPTIN SR was similar to ISOPTIN immediate release; rates of absorption were, of course, different. In a randomized, single-dose, crossover study using healthy volunteers, administration of 240 mg ISOPTIN SR with food produced peak plasma verapamil concentrations of 79 ng/mL, time to peak plasma verapamil concentration of 7.71 hours, and AUC (0-24 hr) of 841 ng-hr/mL. When ISOPTIN SR was administered to fasting subjects, peak plasma verapamil concentration was 164 ng/mL; time to peak plasma verapamil concentration was 5.21 hours; and AUC (0-24 hr) was 1,478 ng-hr/mL. Similar results were demonstrated for plasma norverapamil. Food thus produces decreased bioavailability (AUC) but a narrower peak to trough ratio. Good correlation of dose and response is not available, but controlled studies of ISOPTIN SR have shown effectiveness of doses similar to the effective doses of ISOPTIN (immediate release).</p>
<p><a name="INV-fde2ca83-7dda-4480-9fdd-53ff78a2b040"></a>In healthy man, orally administered ISOPTIN undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver. Twelve metabolites have been identified in plasma; all except norverapamil are present in trace amounts only. Norverapamil can reach steadystate plasma concentrations approximately equal to those of verapamil itself. The cardiovascular activity of norverapamil appears to be approximately 20% that of verapamil. Approximately 70% of an administered dose is excreted as metabolites in the urine and 16% or more in the feces within 5 days. About 3% to 4% is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Approximately 90% is bound to plasma proteins. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic insufficiency</span>, metabolism of immediate release verapamil is delayed and elimination half-life prolonged up to 14 to 16 hours (see PRECAUTIONS); the volume of distribution is increased and plasma clearance reduced to about 30% of normal. Verapamil clearance values suggest that patients with liver dysfunction may attain therapeutic verapamil plasma concentrations with one third of the oral daily dose required for patients with normal liver function.</p>
<p><a name="INV-1a0cedfa-4991-482c-b7f0-e3bfce8fe447"></a>After four weeks of oral dosing (120 mg q.i.d.), verapamil and norverapamil levels were noted in the cerebrospinal fluid with estimated partition coefficient of 0.06 for verapamil and 0.04 for norverapamil. </p>
<p><a name="INV-257f1355-1b36-42ca-86b4-e2a03a20c381"></a>In ten healthy males, administration of oral verapamil (80 mg every 8 hours for 6 days) and a single oral dose of ethanol (0.8 g/kg) resulted in a 17% increase in mean peak ethanol concentrations (106.45 ± 21.40 to 124.23 ± 24.74 mg•hr/dL) compared to placebo. The area under the blood ethanol concentration versus time curve (AUC over 12 hours) increased by 30% (365.67 ± 93.52 to 475.07 ± 97.24 mg•hr/dL). Verapamil AUCs were positively correlated (r=0.71) to increased ethanol blood AUC values. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions.)</p>

Improved left ventricular diastolic function in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4124693" conceptname="Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy">IHSS</span> and those with coronary heart disease has also been observed with ISOPTIN therapy.

Chronic verapamil treatment can increase serum digoxin levels by 50 to 75% during the first week of therapy, and this can result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">digitalis toxicity</span>. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4064161" conceptname="Cirrhosis of liver">hepatic cirrhosis</span> the influence of verapamil on digoxin kinetics is magnified. Verapamil may reduce total body clearance and extrarenal clearance of digitoxin by 27% and 29%, respectively. Maintenance and digitalization doses should be reduced when verapamil is administered, and the patient should be carefully monitored to avoid over or underdigitalization. Whenever overdigitalization is suspected, the daily dose of digitalis should be reduced or temporarily discontinued. Upon discontinuation of ISOPTIN (verapamil HCI), the patient should be reassessed to avoid underdigitalization.</p>

Patients receiving these combinations should be appropriately monitored. Concomitant use of agents that attenuate alpha-adrenergic function with verapamil may result in a reduction in blood pressure that is excessive in some patients. Such an effect was observed in one study following the concomitant administration of verapamil and prazosin.</p>

<p><a name="INV-3035394a-8788-46d0-b30b-2457d6e0ee75"></a>Treat all verapamil <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> as serious and maintain observation for at least 48 hours [especially ISOPTIN<span class="Sup">®</span> SR (verapamil hydrochloride)] preferably under continuous hospital care. Delayed pharmacodynamic consequences may occur with the sustained release formulation. Verapamil is known to decrease gastrointestinal transit time.</p>
<p><a name="INV-aa8e13b0-58a5-4604-919a-7aecede14f3f"></a>In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, tablets of ISOPTIN SR have occasionally been reported to form concretions within the stomach or intestines. These concretions have not been visible on plain radiographs of the abdomen, and no medical means of gastrointestinal emptying is of proven efficacy in removing them. Endoscopy might reasonably be considered in cases of massive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> when symptoms are unusually prolonged.</p>
<p><a name="INV-79e71756-f119-4581-9eb0-9e0428f9f087"></a>Treatment of overdosage should be supportive. Beta adrenergic stimulation or parenteral administration of calcium solutions may increase calcium ion flux across the slow channel, and have been used effectively in treatment of deliberate overdosage with verapamil. Continued treatment with large doses of calcium may produce a response. In a few reported cases, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> with calcium channel blockers that was initially refractory to atropine became more responsive to this treatment when the patients received large doses (close to 1 gram/hour for more than 24 hours) of calcium chloride. Verapamil cannot be removed by hemodialysis. Clinically significant hypotensive reactions or high degree <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316135" conceptname="Atrioventricular block">AV block</span> should be treated with vasopressor agents or cardiac pacing, respectively. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">Asystole</span> should be handled by the usual measures including cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</p>

<p><a name="INV-3b8c348b-8b09-49bf-9234-1ccf38143c18"></a>The dose of ISOPTIN SR should be individualized by titration and the drug should be administered with food. Initiate therapy with 180 mg of sustained-release verapamil HCI, ISOPTIN SR, given in the morning. Lower, initial doses of 120 mg a day may be warranted in patients who may have an increased response to verapamil (e.g., the elderly or small people etc.). Upward titration should be based on therapeutic efficacy and safety evaluated weekly and approximately 24 hours after the previous dose. The antihypertensive effects of ISOPTIN SR are evident within the first week of therapy.</p>
<p><a name="INV-ae0db547-9dc9-49d1-b565-34d9c8498cc6"></a>If adequate response is not obtained with 180 mg of ISOPTIN SR, the dose may be titrated upward in the following manner:</p>
<p><a name="INV-c49ad36f-e114-4221-9002-113953e3bed0"></a>a) 240 mg each morning,</p>
