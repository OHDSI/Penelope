<h2>Mechanism of Action:</h2>
<p class="First">Zafirlukast is a selective and competitive receptor antagonist of leukotriene D<span class="Sub">4</span> and E<span class="Sub">4</span> (LTD<span class="Sub">4</span> and LTE<span class="Sub">4</span>), components of slow-reacting substance of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylaxis</span> (SRSA).  Cysteinyl leukotriene production and receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>, including airway <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span>, smooth muscle constriction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>. Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> were found in one study to be 25-100 times more sensitive to the bronchoconstricting activity of inhaled LTD<span class="Sub">4</span> than nonasthmatic subjects.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies demonstrated that zafirlukast antagonized the contractile activity of three leukotrienes (LTC<span class="Sub">4</span>, LTD<span class="Sub">4</span> and LTE<span class="Sub">4</span>) in conducting airway smooth muscle from laboratory animals and humans.  Zafirlukast prevented intradermal LTD<span class="Sub">4</span>-induced increases in cutaneous vascular permeability and inhibited inhaled LTD<span class="Sub">4</span>-induced influx of eosinophils into animal lungs.  Inhalational challenge studies in sensitized sheep showed that zafirlukast suppressed the airway responses to antigen; this included both the early- and late-phase response and the nonspecific hyperresponsiveness.</p>
<p>In humans, zafirlukast inhibited <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256717" conceptname="Bronchospasm">bronchoconstriction</span> caused by several kinds of inhalational challenges.  Pretreatment with single oral doses of zafirlukast inhibited the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256717" conceptname="Bronchospasm">bronchoconstriction</span> caused by sulfur dioxide and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">cold</span> air in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>.  Pretreatment with single doses of zafirlukast attenuated the early- and late-phase reaction caused by inhalation of various antigens such as grass, cat dander, ragweed, and mixed antigens in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>. Zafirlukast also attenuated the increase in bronchial hyperresponsiveness to inhaled histamine that followed inhaled allergen challenge.</p>

<h2>Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Bioavailability:</h2>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-2.3"></a><p></p>
<h2><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></h2>
<p class="First">Zafirlukast is rapidly absorbed following oral administration.  Peak plasma concentrations are generally achieved 3 hours after oral administration.  The absolute bioavailability of zafirlukast is unknown.  In two separate studies, one using a high fat and the other a high protein meal, administration of zafirlukast with food reduced the mean bioavailability by approximately 40%.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-2.4"></a><p></p>
<h2><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></h2>
<p class="First">Zafirlukast is more than 99% bound to plasma proteins, predominantly albumin.  The degree of binding was independent of concentration in the clinically relevant range. The apparent steady-state volume of distribution (Vss/F) is approximately 70 L, suggesting moderate distribution into tissues.  Studies in rats using radiolabeled zafirlukast indicate minimal distribution across the blood-brain barrier.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-2.5"></a><p></p>
<h2><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></h2>
<p class="First">Zafirlukast is extensively metabolized.  The most common metabolic products are hydroxylated metabolites which are excreted in the feces.  The metabolites of zafirlukast identified in plasma are at least 90 times less potent as LTD<span class="Sub">4</span> receptor antagonists than zafirlukast in a standard <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> test of activity.  <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies using human liver microsomes showed that the hydroxylated metabolites of zafirlukast excreted in the feces are formed through the cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) pathway.  Additional <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies utilizing human liver microsomes show that zafirlukast inhibits the cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 isoenzymes at concentrations close to the clinically achieved total plasma concentrations (see <a href="#williamsonbk1131387802291">Drug Interactions</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-2.6"></a><p></p>
<h2><span class="Bold">Excretion</span></h2>
<p class="First">The apparent oral clearance (CL/f) of zafirlukast is approximately 20 L/h.  Studies in the rat and dog suggest that biliary excretion is the primary route of excretion.  Following oral administration of radiolabeled zafirlukast to volunteers, urinary excretion accounts for approximately 10% of the dose and the remainder is excreted in feces.  Zafirlukast is not detected in urine.</p>
<p>In the pivotal bioequivalence study, the mean terminal half-life of zafirlukast is approximately 10 hours in both normal adult subjects and patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>.  In other studies, the mean plasma half-life of zafirlukast ranged from approximately 8 to 16 hours in both normal subjects and patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>.  The pharmacokinetics of zafirlukast are approximately linear over the range from 5 mg to 80 mg.  Steady-state plasma concentrations of zafirlukast are proportional to the dose and predictable from single-dose pharmacokinetic data.  Accumulation of zafirlukast in the plasma following twice-daily dosing is approximately 45%.</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetic parameters of zafirlukast 20 mg administered as a single dose to 36 male volunteers are shown with the table below.</p>

<p>Weight unadjusted apparent clearance was 11.4 L/h (42%) in the 7-11 year old children and 9.2 L/h (37%) in the 5-6 year old children, which resulted in greater systemic drug exposures than that obtained in adults for an identical dose.  To maintain similar exposure levels in children compared to adults, a dose of 10 mg twice daily is recommended in children 5-11 years of age (see <a href="#williamsonbk1131387848681">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>

<p class="First">Cases of life-threatening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic failure</span> have been reported in patients treated with ACCOLATE.  Cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver injury</span> without other attributable cause have been reported from post-marketing adverse event surveillance of patients who have received the recommended dose of ACCOLATE (40 mg/day).  In most, but not all post-marketing reports, the patientâ€™s symptoms abated and the liver enzymes returned to normal or near normal after stopping ACCOLATE.  In rare cases, patients have either presented with fulminant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> or progressed to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic failure</span>, liver transplantation and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. In extremely rare post-marketing cases, no clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of liver dysfunction were reported to precede the latter observations.</p>
<p>Physicians may consider the value of liver function testing.  Periodic serum transaminase testing has not proven to prevent serious injury but it is generally believed that early detection of drug-induced hepatic injury along with immediate withdrawal of the suspect drug enhances the likelihood for recovery.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised to be alert for signs and symptoms of liver dysfunction (eg, right upper quadrant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4061577" conceptname="Lethargy">lethargy</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span>, flu-like symptoms, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">anorexia</span>) and to contact their physician immediately if they occur.  Ongoing clinical assessment of patients should govern physician interventions, including diagnostic evaluations and treatment.</p>

<p>ACCOLATE is indicated for the chronic treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> and should be taken regularly as prescribed, even during symptom-free periods.  ACCOLATE is not a bronchodilator and should not be used to treat acute episodes of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>.  Patients receiving ACCOLATE should be instructed not to decrease the dose or stop taking any other antiasthma medications unless instructed by a physician. Patients should be instructed to notify their physician if neuropsychiatric events occur while using ACCOLATE (see <a href="#powellk11242666522624">PRECAUTIONS, Neuropsychiatric Events</a>). Women who are breast-feeding should be instructed not to take ACCOLATE (see <a href="#williamsonbk1131388142070">PRECAUTIONS, Nursing Mothers</a>).  Alternative antiasthma medication should be considered in such patients.</p>
<p>The bioavailability of ACCOLATE may be decreased when taken with food.  Patients should be instructed to take ACCOLATE at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions: </h2>
<p class="First">In a drug interaction study in 16 healthy male volunteers, coadministration of multiple doses of zafirlukast (160 mg/day) to steady-state with a single 25 mg dose of warfarin resulted in a significant increase in the mean AUC (+ 63%) and half-life (+36%) of S-warfarin.  The mean <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time (PT) increased by approximately 35%.  This interaction is probably due to an inhibition by zafirlukast of the cytochrome P450 2C9 isoenzyme system.  Patients on oral warfarin anticoagulant therapy and ACCOLATE should have their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> times monitored closely and anticoagulant dose adjusted accordingly (see <a href="#williamsonbk1131388212897">WARNINGS, Concomitant Warfarin Administration</a>).  No formal drug-drug interaction studies with ACCOLATE and other drugs known to be metabolized by the cytochrome P450 2C9 isoenzyme (eg, tolbutamide, phenytoin, carbamazepine) have been conducted; however, care should be exercised when ACCOLATE is coadministered with these drugs.</p>
<p>In a drug interaction study in 11 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatic</span> patients, coadministration of a single dose of zafirlukast (40 mg) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 5 days) to steady-state resulted in decreased mean plasma levels of zafirlukast by approximately 40% due to a decrease in zafirlukast bioavailability.</p>
<p>Coadministration of zafirlukast (20 mg/day) or placebo at steady-state with a single dose of sustained release theophylline preparation (16 mg/kg) in 16 healthy boys and girls (6 through 11 years of age) resulted in no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of theophylline.</p>
<p>Coadministration of zafirlukast (80 mg/day) at steady-state with a single dose of a liquid theophylline preparation (6 mg/kg) in 13 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatic</span> patients, 18 to 44 years of age, resulted in decreased mean plasma levels of zafirlukast by approximately 30%, but no effect on plasma theophylline levels was observed.</p>
<p>Rare cases of patients experiencing increased theophylline levels with or without clinical signs or symptoms of theophylline toxicity after the addition of ACCOLATE to an existing theophylline regimen have been reported.  The mechanism of the interaction between ACCOLATE and theophylline in these patients is unknown (see <a href="#williamsonbk1131387977133">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a>).</p>
<p>Coadministration of zafirlukast (40 mg/day) with aspirin (650 mg four times daily) resulted in mean increased plasma levels of zafirlukast by approximately 45%.</p>
<p>In a single-blind, parallel-group, 3-week study in 39 healthy female subjects taking oral contraceptives, 40 mg twice daily of zafirlukast had no significant effect on ethinyl estradiol plasma concentrations or contraceptive efficacy.</p>
<p>No formal drug-drug interaction studies between ACCOLATE and marketed drugs known to be metabolized by the P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) isoenzyme (eg, dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers, cyclosporin, cisapride) have been conducted. As ACCOLATE is known to be an inhibitor of CYP3A4 <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>, it is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when these drugs are coadministered with ACCOLATE.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:</h2>
<p class="First">In two-year carcinogenicity studies, zafirlukast was administered at dietary doses of 10, 100, and 300 mg/kg to mice and 40, 400, and 2000 mg/kg to rats.  Male mice at an oral dose of 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 30 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and in children on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) showed an increased incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4301500" conceptname="Liver cell adenoma">hepatocellular adenomas</span>; female mice at this dose showed a greater incidence of whole body histocytic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084784" conceptname="Sarcoma">sarcomas</span>.  Male and female rats at an oral dose of 2000 mg/kg/day (resulting in approximately 160 times the exposure to drug plus metabolites from the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and in children based on a comparison of the plasma area-under the curve [AUC] values) of zafirlukast showed an increased incidence of urinary bladder transitional cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4034142" conceptname="Papilloma">papillomas</span>. Zafirlukast was not tumorigenic at oral doses up to 100 mg/kg (approximately 10 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and in children on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) in mice and at oral doses up to 400 mg/kg (resulting in approximately 140 times the exposure to drug plus metabolites from the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and in children based on a comparison of the plasma AUC values) in rats.  The clinical significance of these findings for the long-term use of ACCOLATE is unknown.</p>
<p>Zafirlukast showed no evidence of mutagenic potential in the reverse microbial assay, in 2 forward point mutation (CHO-HGPRT and mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span>) assays or in two assays for chromosomal aberrations (the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> human peripheral blood lymphocyte clastogenic assay and the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> rat bone marrow micronucleus assay).</p>
<p>No evidence of impairment of fertility and reproduction was seen in male and female rats treated with zafirlukast at oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg (approximately 410 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers:</span></h2>
<p class="First">Zafirlukast is excreted in breast milk. Following repeated 40 mg twice-a-day dosing in healthy women, average steady-state concentrations of zafirlukast in breast milk were 50 ng/mL compared to 255 ng/mL in plasma.  Because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for zafirlukast in mouse and rat studies and the enhanced sensitivity of neonatal rats and dogs to the adverse effects of zafirlukast, ACCOLATE should not be administered to mothers who are breast-feeding.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use:</span></h2>
<p class="First">The safety of ACCOLATE at doses of 10 mg twice daily has been demonstrated in 205 pediatric patients 5 through 11 years of age in placebo-controlled trials lasting up to six weeks and with 179 patients in this age range participating in 52 weeks of treatment in an open label extension.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of ACCOLATE for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> in pediatric patients 5 through 11 years of age is based on an extrapolation of the demonstrated efficacy of ACCOLATE in adults with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> and the likelihood that the disease course, and pathophysiology and the drugâ€™s effect are substantially similar between the two populations.  The recommended dose for the patients 5 through 11 years of age is based upon a cross-study comparison of the pharmacokinetics of zafirlukast in adults and pediatric subjects, and on the safety profile of zafirlukast in both adult and pediatric patients at doses equal to or higher than the recommended dose.</p>
<p>The safety and effectiveness of zafirlukast for pediatric patients less than 5 years of age has not been established. The effect of ACCOLATE on growth in children has not been determined.  </p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Geriatric Use:</span></h2>
<p class="First">Based on cross-study comparison, the clearance of zafirlukast is reduced in patients 65 years of age and older such that C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC are approximately 2- to 3-fold greater than those of younger patients (see <a href="#williamsonbk1131387848681">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a> and <a href="#williamsonbk1131388273647">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>).</p>
<p>A total of 8094 patients were exposed to zafirlukast in North American and European short-term placebo-controlled clinical trials. Of these, 243 patients were elderly (age 65 years and older). No overall difference in adverse events was seen in the elderly patients, except for an increase in the frequency of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> among zafirlukast-treated elderly patients compared to placebo-treated elderly patients (7.0% vs. 2.9%).  The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> were not severe, occurred mostly in the lower respiratory tract, and did not necessitate withdrawal of therapy.</p>
<p>An open-label, uncontrolled, 4-week trial of 3759 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> patients compared the safety and efficacy of ACCOLATE 20 mg given twice daily in three patient age groups, adolescents (12-17 years), adults (18-65 years), and elderly (greater than 65 years). A higher percentage of elderly patients (n=384) reported adverse events when compared to adults and adolescents.  These elderly patients showed less improvement in efficacy measures.

In rare cases, patients have presented with fulminant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> or progressed to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic failure</span>, liver transplantation and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> (see <a href="#williamsonbk1131388093117">WARNINGS, Hepatotoxicity </a> and <a href="#williamsonbk1131387955212">PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients</a>).</p>
<p>In clinical trials, an increased proportion of zafirlukast patients over the age of 55 years reported <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> as compared to placebo-treated patients.  A similar finding was not observed in other age groups studied.  These <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> were mostly mild or moderate in intensity and predominantly affected the respiratory tract.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">Infections</span> occurred equally in both sexes, were dose-proportional to total milligrams of zafirlukast exposure, and were associated with coadministration of inhaled corticosteroids.  The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.</p>
<p>In rare cases, patients on ACCOLATE therapy may present with systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302954" conceptname="Disorder characterized by eosinophilia">eosinophilia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4279553" conceptname="Eosinophilic asthma">eosinophilic pneumonia</span>, or  clinical features of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137275" conceptname="Vasculitis">vasculitis</span> consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic steroid therapy.  These events usually, but not always, have been associated with the reduction of oral steroid therapy.  Physicians should be alert to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302954" conceptname="Disorder characterized by eosinophilia">eosinophilia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4098878" conceptname="Vasculitic rash">vasculitic rash</span>, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197608" conceptname="Peripheral neuritis in pregnancy">neuropathy</span> presenting in their patients.  A causal association between ACCOLATE and these underlying conditions has not been established (see <a href="#powellk11242667207548">PRECAUTIONS, Eosinophilic Conditions</a>).</p>
<p>Neuropsychiatric adverse events, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, have been reported in association with ACCOLATE therapy (see <a href="#powellk11242666522624">PRECAUTIONS, Neuropsychiatric Events</a>). <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">Hypersensitivity reactions</span>, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="139900" conceptname="Urticaria">urticaria</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432791" conceptname="Angioedema">angioedema</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rashes</span>, with or without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443720" conceptname="Blister">blistering</span>, have also been reported in association with ACCOLATE therapy.  Additionally, there have been reports of patients experiencing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440689" conceptname="Agranulocytosis">agranulocytosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441737" conceptname="Contusion">bruising</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77074" conceptname="Joint pain">arthralgia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442752" conceptname="Muscle pain">myalgia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4272240" conceptname="Malaise">malaise</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span> in association with ACCOLATE therapy.</p>
<p>Rare cases of patients experiencing increased theophylline levels with or without clinical signs or symptoms of theophylline toxicity after the addition of ACCOLATE to an existing theophylline regimen have been reported.  The mechanism of the interaction between ACCOLATE and theophylline in these patients is unknown and not predicted by available <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> metabolism data and the results of two clinical drug interaction studies (see <a href="#williamsonbk1131388273647">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a> and <a href="#williamsonbk1131387802291">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</a>).</p>

<h2>Pediatric Patients 5 through 11 years of age</h2>
<p class="First">ACCOLATE has been evaluated for safety in 788 pediatric patients 5 through 11 years of age.  Cumulatively, 313 pediatric patients were treated with ACCOLATE 10 mg twice daily or higher for at least 6 months, and 113 of them were treated for one year or longer in clinical trials. The safety profile of ACCOLATE 10 mg twice daily-versus placebo in the 4- and 6-week double-blind trials was generally similar to that observed in the adult clinical trials with ACCOLATE 20 mg twice daily.</p>
<p>In pediatric patients receiving ACCOLATE in multi-dose clinical trials, the following events occurred with a frequency of â‰¥ 2% and more frequently than in pediatric patients who received placebo, regardless of causality assessment: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> (4.5 vs. 4.2%) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal pain</span> (2.8 vs. 2.3%).</p>
<p>The post-marketing experience in this age group is similar to that seen in adults, including hepatic dysfunction, which may lead to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">liver failure</span>.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">No <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> occurred at oral zafirlukast doses of 2000 mg/kg in mice (approximately 210 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and children on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis), 2000 mg/kg in rats (approximately 420 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and children on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis), and 500 mg/kg in dogs (approximately 350 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and children on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).</p>
<p>Overdosage with ACCOLATE has been reported in four patients surviving reported doses as high as 200 mg. The predominant symptoms reported following ACCOLATE <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012224" conceptname="Upset stomach">upset stomach</span>.  There were no acute toxic effects in humans that could be consistently ascribed to the administration of ACCOLATE.  It is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures in the event of an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>; eg, remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Because food can reduce the bioavailability of zafirlukast, ACCOLATE should be taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">Elderly Patients:</span> Based on cross-study comparisons, the clearance of zafirlukast is reduced in elderly patients (65 years of age and older), such that C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC are approximately twice those of younger adults.
