<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cell Culture Studies</span></p>
<p>Cytarabine is cytotoxic to a wide variety of proliferating mammalian cells in culture. It exhibits cell phase specificity, primarily killing cells undergoing DNA synthesis (S-phase) and under certain conditions blocking the progression of cells from the G<span class="Sub">1</span> phase to the S-phase. Although the mechanism of action is not completely understood, it appears that cytarabine acts through the inhibition of DNA polymerase. A limited, but significant, incorporation of cytarabine into both DNA and RNA has also been reported. Extensive chromosomal damage, including chromatid breaks, have been produced by cytarabine and malignant transformation of rodent cells in culture has been reported. Deoxycytidine prevents or delays (but does not reverse) the cytotoxic activity.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Cellular Resistance and Sensitivity</span></p>
<p>Cytarabine is metabolized by deoxycytidine kinase and other nucleotide kinases to the nucleotide triphosphate, an effective inhibitor of DNA polymerase; it is inactivated by a pyrimidine nucleoside deaminase, which converts it to the nontoxic uracil derivative. It appears that the balance of kinase and deaminase levels may be an important factor in determining sensitivity or resistance of the cell to cytarabine.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Human Pharmacology</span></p>
<p>Cytarabine is rapidly metabolized and is not effective orally; less than 20 percent of the orally administered dose is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
<p>Following rapid intravenous injection of cytarabine labeled with tritium, the disappearance from plasma is biphasic. There is an initial distributive phase with a half-life of about 10 minutes, followed by a second elimination phase with a half-life of about 1 to 3 hours. After the distributive phase, more than 80 percent of plasma radioactivity can be accounted for by the inactive metabolite 1-ÃŸ-D-arabinofuranosyluracil (ara-U). Within 24 hours about 80 percent of the administered radioactivity can be recovered in the urine, approximately 90 percent of which is excreted as ara-U.</p>
<p>Relatively constant plasma levels can be achieved by continuous intravenous infusion.</p>
<p>After subcutaneous or intramuscular administration of cytarabine labeled with tritium, peak-plasma levels of radioactivity are achieved about 20 to 60 minutes after injection and are considerably lower than those after intravenous administration.</p>
<p>Cerebrospinal fluid levels of cytarabine are low in comparison to plasma levels after single intravenous injection. However, in one patient in whom cerebrospinal fluid levels are examined after 2 hours of constant intravenous infusion, levels approached 40 percent of the steady state plasma level. With intrathecal administration, levels of cytarabine in the cerebrospinal fluid declined with a first order half-life of about 2 hours. Because cerebrospinal fluid levels of deaminase are low, little conversion to ara-U was observed.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Immunosuppressive Action</span></p>
<p>Cytarabine injection is capable of obliterating immune responses in man during administration with little or no accompanying toxicity. Suppression of antibody responses to E-coli-VI antigen and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435740" conceptname="Tetanus">tetanus</span> toxoid have been demonstrated. This suppression was obtained during both primary and secondary antibody responses.</p>
<p>Cytarabine injection also suppressed the development of cell-mediated immune responses such as delayed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089139" conceptname="Skin reaction">skin reaction</span> to dinitrochlorobenzene. However, it had no effect on already established delayed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span>.</p>
<p>Following 5-day courses of intensive therapy with cytarabine injection the immune response was suppressed, as indicated by the following parameters: macrophage ingress into skin windows; circulating antibody response following primary antigenic stimulation; lymphocyte blastogenesis with phytohemagglutinin. A few days after termination of therapy there was a rapid return to normal.</p>

<p>Cytarabine is a potent bone marrow suppressant. Therapy should be started cautiously in patients with pre-existing drug-induced bone marrow suppression.

<p><span class="Bold">Use in Pregnancy (Category D)</span></p>
<p>Cytarabine Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Cytarabine causes abnormal cerebellar development in the neonatal hamster and is teratogenic to the rat fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant.</p>
<p>A review of the literature has shown 32 reported cases where cytarabine injection was given during pregnancy, either alone or in combination with other cytotoxic agents:</p>
<p>Eighteen normal infants were delivered. Four of these had first trimester exposure. Five infants were premature or of low birth weight. Twelve of the 18 normal infants were followed up at ages ranging from six weeks to seven years and showed no abnormalities. One apparently normal infant died at 90 days of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4101468" conceptname="Gastroenteritis">gastroenteritis</span>.</p>
<p>Two cases of congenital abnormalities have been reported, one with upper and lower distal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134741" conceptname="Congenital anomaly of limb">limb defects</span>, and the other with extremity and ear deformities. Both of these cases had first trimester exposure.</p>
<p>There were seven infants with various problems in the neonatal period, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432881" conceptname="Pancytopenia">pancytopenia</span>, transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> of WBC, hematocrit or platelets; electrolyte abnormalities; transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302954" conceptname="Disorder characterized by eosinophilia">eosinophilia</span>; and one case of increased IgM levels and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260205" conceptname="Hyperpyrexia">hyperpyrexia</span> possibly due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="132797" conceptname="Sepsis">sepsis</span>. Six of the seven infants were also premature. The child with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432881" conceptname="Pancytopenia">pancytopenia</span> died at 21 days of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="132797" conceptname="Sepsis">sepsis</span>.</p>
<p>Therapeutic abortions were done in five cases. Four fetuses were grossly normal, but one had an enlarged spleen and another showed Trisomy C <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434153" conceptname="Congenital chromosomal disease">chromosome abnormality</span> in the chorionic tissue.</p>
<p>Because of the potential for abnormalities with cytotoxic therapy, particularly during the first trimester, a patient who is or who may become pregnant while on cytarabine should be apprised of the potential risk to the fetus and the advisability of pregnancy continuation. There is a definite, but considerably reduced risk if therapy is initiated during the second or third trimester. Although normal infants have been delivered to patients treated in all three trimesters of pregnancy, follow-up of such infants would be advisable.</p>

<h2>1. General Precautions</h2>
<p class="First">Patients receiving Cytarabine Injection must be monitored closely. Frequent platelet and leucocyte counts and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4043761" conceptname="Bone marrow examination">bone marrow examinations</span> are mandatory. Consider suspending or modifying therapy when drug-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4145241" conceptname="Bone marrow depression">marrow depression</span> has resulted in a platelet count under 50,000 or a polymorphonuclear granulocyte count under 1000/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>. Counts of formed elements in the peripheral blood may continue to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> after the drug is stopped and reach lowest values after drug-free intervals of 12 to 24 days. When indicated, restart therapy when definite signs of marrow recovery appear (on successive bone marrow studies). Patients whose drug is withheld until â€œnormalâ€? peripheral blood values are attained may escape from control.</p>
<p>When large intravenous doses are given too quickly, patients are frequently <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nauseated</span> and may vomit for several hours post-injection. This problem tends to be less severe when the drug is infused.</p>
<p>The human liver apparently detoxifies a substantial fraction of an administered dose. In particular, patients with renal or hepatic function impairment may have a higher likelihood of CNS toxicity after high-dose cytarabine injection treatment. Use the drug with caution and possibly at reduced dose in patients whose liver or kidney function is poor.</p>
<p>Periodic checks of bone marrow, liver and kidney functions should be performed in patients receiving cytarabine injection.</p>
<p>Like other cytotoxic drugs, Cytarabine Injection may induce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4147761" conceptname="Hyperuricemia">hyperuricemia</span> secondary to rapid lysis of neoplastic cells. The clinician should monitor the patientâ€™s blood uric acid level and be prepared to use such supportive and pharmacologic measures as might be necessary to control this problem.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="199074" conceptname="Acute pancreatitis">Acute pancreatitis</span> has been reported to occur in a patient receiving Cytarabine Injection by continuous infusion and in patients being treated with Cytarabine Injection who have had prior treatment with L-asparaginase.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">Steady-state plasma digitoxin concentrations did not appear to change.

<p>Because cytarabine is a bone marrow suppressant, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435224" conceptname="Leukopenia">leukopenia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435789" conceptname="Megaloblastic anemia">megaloblastosis</span> and reduced reticulocytes can be expected as a result of administration with Cytarabine Injection. The severity of these reactions are dose and schedule dependent. Cellular changes in the morphology of bone marrow and peripheral smears can be expected.</p>
<p>Following 5-day constant infusions or acute injections of 50 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> to 600 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, white cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> follows a biphasic course. Regardless of initial count, dosage level, or schedule, there is an initial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> starting the first 24 hours with a nadir at days 7 - 9. This is followed by a brief rise which peaks around the twelfth day. A second and deeper <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> reaches nadir at days 15 - 24. Then there is a rapid rise to above baseline in the next 10 days. Platelet <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> is noticeable at 5 days with a peak <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> occurring between days 12 - 15. Thereupon, a rapid rise to above baseline occurs in the next 10 days.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Infectious Complications</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Injection: </span>Viral, bacterial, fungal, parasitic, or saprophytic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span>, in any location in the body may be associated with the use of cytarabine injection alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents following immunosuppressant doses that affect cellular or humoral immunity. These <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> may be mild, but can be severe and at times fatal.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">The Cytarabine (Ara-C) Syndrome</span></p>
<p>A cytarabine syndrome has been described by Castleberry. It is characterized by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442752" conceptname="Muscle pain">myalgia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129418" conceptname="Bone pain">bone pain</span>, occasionally <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77670" conceptname="Chest pain">chest pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4083795" conceptname="Maculopapular eruption">maculopapular rash</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="379019" conceptname="Conjunctivitis">conjunctivitis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4272240" conceptname="Malaise">malaise</span>. It usually occurs 6 - 12 hours following drug administration. Corticosteroids have been shown to be beneficial in treating or preventing this syndrome. If the symptoms of the syndrome are deemed treatable, corticosteroids should be contemplated as well as continuation of therapy with Cytarabine Injection.</p>

<p class="First">There is no antidote for overdosage of Cytarabine Injection. Doses of 4.5 g/m<span class="Sup">2</span> by intravenous infusion over 1 hour every 12 hours for 12 doses have caused an unacceptable increase in irreversible CNS toxicity and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Cytarabine Injection is not active orally. The schedule and method of administration varies with the program of therapy to be used. Cytarabine Injection may be given by intravenous infusion or injection, subcutaneously, or intrathecally (preservative free preparation only).</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320741" conceptname="Thrombophlebitis">Thrombophlebitis</span> has occurred at the site of drug injection or infusion in some patients, and rarely patients have noted <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> at subcutaneous injection sites. In most instances, however, the drug has been well tolerated.</p>
<p>Patients can tolerate higher total doses when they receive the drug by rapid intravenous injection as compared with slow infusion. This phenomenon is related to the drugâ€™s rapid inactivation and brief exposure of susceptible normal and neoplastic cells to significant levels after rapid injection. Normal and neoplastic cells seem to respond in somewhat parallel fashion to these different modes of administration and no clear-cut clinical advantage has been demonstrated for either.</p>
<p>In the induction therapy of acute non-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="132853" conceptname="Lymphoid leukemia">lymphocytic leukemia</span>, the usual cytarabine dose in combination with other anticancer drugs is 100 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day by continuous IV infusion (Days 1 - 7) or 100 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> IV every 12 hours (Days 1 - 7).</p>
<p>The literature should be consulted for the current recommendations for use in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134305" conceptname="Acute lymphoid leukemia">acute lymphocytic leukemia</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Intrathecal Use in Meningeal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315497" conceptname="Subacute leukemia">Leukemia</span></span></p>
<p>Cytarabine Injection has been used intrathecally in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138708" conceptname="Acute leukemia">acute leukemia</span> in doses ranging from 5 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> to 75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> of body surface area. The frequency of administration varied from once a day for 4 days to once every 4 days. The most frequently used dose was 30 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> every 4 days until cerebrospinal fluid findings were normal, followed by one additional treatment. The dosage schedule is usually governed by the type and severity of central nervous system manifestations and the response to previous therapy.</p>
<p>Cytarabine injection given intrathecally may cause systemic toxicity and careful monitoring of the hematopoietic system is indicated. Modification of other anti-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315497" conceptname="Subacute leukemia">leukemia</span> therapy may be necessary. Major toxicity is rare. The most frequently reported reactions after intrathecal administration were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>; these reactions are mild and self-limiting. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192606" conceptname="Paraplegia">Paraplegia</span> has been reported. Necrotizing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4027461" conceptname="Leukoencephalopathy">leukoencephalopathy</span> occurred in 5 children; these patients had also been treated with intrathecal methotrexate and hydrocortisone, as well as by central nervous system radiation. Isolated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4024301" conceptname="Neurotoxicity">neurotoxicity</span> has been reported. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377551" conceptname="Blind hypertensive eye">Blindness</span> occurred in two patients in remission whose treatment had consisted of combination systemic chemotherapy, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118659" conceptname="Prophylactic">prophylactic</span> central nervous system radiation and intrathecal cytarabine injection.</p>
<p>When Cytarabine injection is administered both intrathecally and intravenously within a few days, there is an increased risk of spinal cord toxicity, however, in serious life-threatening disease, concurrent use of intravenous and intrathecal Cytarabine Injection is left to the discretion of the treating physician.</p>
<p>Focal leukemic involvement of the central nervous system may not respond to intrathecal cytarabine injection and may better be treated with radiotherapy.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Chemical Stability of Infusion Solutions</span></p>
<p>Chemical stability studies were performed by <span class="Underline">ultraviolet assay</span> on Cytarabine Injection in infusion solutions. These studies showed that when Cytarabine Injection was added to Water for Injection, 5% Dextrose in water or Sodium Chloride Injection, <span class="Underline">94</span> to <span class="Underline">96</span> percent of the cytarabine was present after 192 hours storage at room temperature.</p>
<p>Parenteral drugs should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration, prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">HANDLING AND DISPOSAL</span></p>
<p>Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anti-cancer drugs should be considered. Several guidelines on this subject have been published.<span class="Sup">1-7</span>There is no general agreement that all of the procedures recommended in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate.</p>
