<p class="First">Severe and sometimes fatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> associated with isoniazid therapy may occur and may develop even after many months of treatment. The risk of developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> is age related. Approximate case rates by age are: 0 per 1,000 for persons under 20 years of age, 3 per 1,000 for persons in the 20 to 34 year age group, 12 per 1,000 for persons in the 35 to 49 year age group, 23 per 1,000 for persons in the 50 to 64 year age group, and 8 per 1,000 for persons over 65 years of age. The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> is increased with daily consumption of alcohol. Precise data to provide a fatality rate for isoniazid-related <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> is not available; however, in a U.S. Public Health Service Surveillance Study of 13,838 persons taking isoniazid, there were 8 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> among 174 cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, patients given isoniazid should be carefully monitored and interviewed at monthly intervals. Serum transaminase concentration becomes elevated in about 10% to 20% of patients, usually during the first few months of therapy, but it can occur at any time. Usually enzyme levels return to normal despite continuance of drug, but in some cases progressive liver dysfunction occurs. Patients should be instructed to report immediately any of the prodromal symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span>, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">weakness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4272240" conceptname="Malaise">malaise</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">anorexia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>. If these symptoms appear or if signs suggestive of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">hepatic damage</span> are detected, isoniazid should be discontinued promptly, since continued use of the drug in these cases has been reported to cause a more severe form of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver damage</span>.</p>
<p>Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span> should be given appropriate treatment with alternative drugs. If isoniazid must be reinstituted, it should be reinstituted only after symptoms and laboratory abnormalities have cleared.

<h2>General</h2>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-2.1.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Rifampin</h3>
<p class="First">Rifampin is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Peak serum levels in healthy adults and pediatric populations vary widely from individual to individual. Following a single 600 mg oral dose of rifampin in healthy adults, the peak serum level averages 7 mcg/mL but may vary from 4 to 32 mcg/mL. Absorption of rifampin is reduced by about 30% when the drug is ingested with food.</p>
<p>In a study of 14 normal human adult males, peak blood levels of rifampin occurred 1 1/2 to 3 hours following oral administration of two RIFAMATE capsules. The peaks ranged from 6.9 to 14 mcg/mL with an average of 10 mcg/mL.</p>
<p>In healthy adults, the biological half-life of rifampin in serum averages 3.35 ± 0.66 hours after a 600 mg oral dose, with increases up to 5.08 ± 2.45 hours reported after a 900 mg dose. With repeated administration, the half-life decreases and reaches average values of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The half-life does not differ in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> at doses not exceeding 600 mg daily and, consequently, no dosage adjustment is required. The half-life of rifampin at a dose of 720 mg daily has not been established in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span>. Following a single 900 mg oral dose of rifampin in patients with varying degrees of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>, the mean half-life increased from 3.6 hours in healthy adults to 5.0, 7.3, and 11.0 hours in patients with glomerular filtration rates of 30 to 50 mL/min, less than 30 mL/min, and in anuric patients, respectively. Refer to the WARNINGS section for information regarding patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic insufficiency</span>.</p>
<p>After absorption, rifampin is rapidly eliminated in the bile, and an enterohepatic circulation ensues. During this process, rifampin undergoes progressive deacetylation so that nearly all the drug in the bile is in this form in about 6 hours. This metabolite has antibacterial activity. Intestinal reabsorption is reduced by deacetylation, and elimination is facilitated. Up to 30% of a dose is excreted in the urine, with about half as unchanged drug.</p>
<p>Rifampin is widely distributed throughout the body. It is present in effective concentrations in many organs and body fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid. Rifampin is about 80% protein bound. Most of the unbound fraction is not ionized and therefore is diffused freely in tissues.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-2.1.1.1"></a><p></p>
<h4>Pediatrics</h4>
<p class="First">In one study, pediatric patients 6 to 58 months old were given rifampin suspended in simple syrup or as dry powder mixed with applesauce at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight. Peak serum concentrations of 10.7 ± 3.7 and 11.5 ± 5.1 mcg/mL were obtained 1 hour after preprandial ingestion of the drug suspension and the applesauce mixture, respectively. After the administration of either preparation, the t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> of rifampin averaged 2.9 hours. It should be noted that in other studies in pediatric populations, at doses of 10 mg/kg body weight, mean peak serum concentrations of 3.5 mcg/mL to 15 mcg/mL have been reported.</p>

<h3>Isoniazid</h3>
<p class="First">After oral administration, isoniazid is readily absorbed from the GI tract and produces peak blood levels within 1 to 2 hours which decline to 50% or less within 6 hours. It diffuses readily into all body fluids (cerebrospinal, pleural, and ascitic fluids), tissues, organs, and excreta (saliva, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4102774" conceptname="Productive cough">sputum</span>, and feces). Isoniazid is not substantially bound to plasma proteins. The drug also passes through the placental barrier and into milk in concentrations comparable to those in the plasma. The plasma half-life of isoniazid in patients with normal renal and hepatic function ranges from 1 to 4 hours, depending on the rate of metabolism. From 50% to 70% of a dose of isoniazid is excreted in the urine in 24 hours, mostly as metabolites.</p>
<p>Isoniazid is metabolized in the liver mainly by acetylation and dehydrazination. The rate of acetylation is genetically determined. Approximately 50% of African Americans and Caucasians are "slow inactivators" and the rest are "rapid inactivators"; the majority of Eskimos and Asians are "rapid inactivators."</p>
<p>The rate of acetylation does not significantly alter the effectiveness of isoniazid. However, slow acetylation may lead to higher blood levels of the drug, and thus an increase in toxic reactions.</p>
<p>Pyridoxine (B<span class="Sub">6</span>) deficiency is sometimes observed in adults with high doses of isoniazid and is probably due to its competition with pyridoxal phosphate for the enzyme apotryptophanase.</p>

<h2>Susceptibility Testing</h2>
<p class="First">Prior to initiation of therapy, appropriate specimens should be collected for identification of the infecting organism and <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> tests.</p>

<p>Two standardized <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> susceptibility methods are available for testing isoniazid and rifampin against <span class="Italics">Mycobacterium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span></span> organisms. The agar proportion method (CDC or CLSI M24-P) utilizes Middlebrook 7H10 medium impregnated with isoniazid at 0.2 and 1.0 mcg/mL and rifampin at 1.0 mcg/mL for the final concentrations of drug. After 3 weeks of incubation MIC<span class="Sub">99</span> values are calculated by comparing the quantity of organisms growing in the medium containing drug to the control cultures. Mycobacterial growth in the presence of drug ≥1% of the control indicates resistance.</p>
<p>The radiometric broth method employs the BACTEC 460 machine to compare the growth index from untreated control cultures to cultures grown in the presence of 0.2 and 1.0 mcg/mL of isoniazid and 2.0 mcg/mL of rifampin. Strict adherence to the manufacturer's instructions for sample processing and data interpretation is required for this assay.</p>
<p>Susceptibility test results obtained by the two different methods can only be compared if the appropriate rifampin or isoniazid concentrations are used for each test method as indicated above. Both test procedures require the use of <span class="Italics">Mycobacterium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span> </span>H37Rv, ATCC 27294, as a control organism.</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">In the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span>, the small number of resistant cells present within large populations of susceptible cells can rapidly become the predominant type. Since resistance can emerge rapidly, susceptibility tests should be performed in the event of persistent positive cultures during the course of treatment. Bacteriologic smears or cultures should be obtained before the start of therapy to confirm the susceptibility of the organism to rifampin and isoniazid, and they should be repeated throughout therapy to monitor response to the treatment. If test results show resistance to any of the components of RIFAMATE and the patient is not responding to therapy, the drug regimen should be modified.</p>
<p>RIFAMATE is indicated for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="253954" conceptname="Pulmonary tuberculosis">pulmonary tuberculosis</span> in which organisms are susceptible, and when the patient has been titrated on the individual components and it has therefore been established that this fixed dosage is therapeutically effective.</p>
<p>This fixed-dosage combination drug is not recommended for initial therapy of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span> or for preventive therapy.</p>
<p>A three-drug regimen consisting of rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide (e.g., RIFATER<span class="Sup">®</span>) is recommended in the initial phase of short-course therapy which is usually continued for 2 months. The Advisory Council for the Elimination of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">Tuberculosis</span>, the American Thoracic Society, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that either streptomycin or ethambutol be added as a fourth drug in a regimen containing isoniazid (INH), rifampin, and pyrazinamide for initial treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span> unless the likelihood of INH resistance is very low. The need for a fourth drug should be reassessed when the results of susceptibility testing are known. If community rates of INH resistance are currently less than 4%, an initial treatment regimen with less than four drugs may be considered.</p>
<p>Following the initial phase, treatment should be continued with RIFAMATE for at least 4 months. Treatment should be continued for longer if the patient is still <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4102774" conceptname="Productive cough">sputum</span> or culture positive, if resistant organisms are present, or if the patient is HIV positive.</p>
<p>This drug is not indicated for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436621" conceptname="Meningococcal infectious disease">meningococcal infections</span> or asymptomatic carriers of <span class="Italics">N</span><span class="Italics">eisseria </span><span class="Italics">meningitidis</span> to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx.</p>

Doses of rifampin greater than 600 mg given once or twice weekly have resulted in a higher incidence of adverse reactions, including the "<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4266367" conceptname="Influenza">flu syndrome</span>" (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4190045" conceptname="Rigor">chills</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4272240" conceptname="Malaise">malaise</span>), hematopoietic reactions (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435224" conceptname="Leukopenia">leukopenia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435503" conceptname="Hemolytic anemia">acute hemolytic anemia</span>), cutaneous, gastrointestinal, and hepatic reactions, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">shortness of breath</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylaxis</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span>. Recent studies indicate that regimens using twice-weekly doses of rifampin 600 mg plus isoniazid 15 mg/kg are much better tolerated.</p>
<p>Rifampin is not recommended for intermittent therapy; the patient should be cautioned against intentional or accidental interruption of the daily dosage regimen since rare renal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span> have been reported when therapy was resumed in such cases.</p>
<p>Rifampin has enzyme induction properties that can enhance the metabolism of endogenous substrates including adrenal hormones, thyroid hormones, and vitamin D.</p>

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-6.4.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Food Interactions</h3>
<p class="First">Because isoniazid has some monoamine oxidase inhibiting activity, an interaction with tyramine-containing foods (cheese, red wine) may occur. Diamine oxidase may also be inhibited, causing exaggerated response (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315078" conceptname="Palpitations">palpitations</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318566" conceptname="Flushing">flushing</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>) to foods containing histamine (e.g., skipjack, tuna, other tropical fish). Tyramine- and histamine-containing foods should be avoided in patients receiving RIFAMATE.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">RIFAMATE, because it contains rifampin, may produce a reddish coloration of the urine, sweat, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4102774" conceptname="Productive cough">sputum</span>, and tears, and the patient should be forewarned of this. </span> Soft contact lenses may be permanently stained.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised that the reliability of oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives may be affected; consideration should be given to using alternative contraceptive measures.</p>
<p>Patients should be instructed to take RIFAMATE either 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal with a full glass of water.</p>
<p>Patients should be instructed to notify their physicians promptly if they experience any of the following: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, loss of appetite, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4272240" conceptname="Malaise">malaise</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, darkened urine, yellowish discoloration of the skin and eyes, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span> of the joints.</p>
<p>Compliance with the full course of therapy must be emphasized, and the importance of not missing any doses must be stressed.</p>

<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">Adults treated for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span> with RIFAMATE should have baseline measurements of hepatic enzymes, bilirubin, serum creatinine, a complete blood count (CBC) and platelet count (or estimate), and blood uric acid.</p>
<p>Patients should be seen at least monthly during therapy and should be specifically questioned concerning symptoms associated with adverse reactions. All patients with abnormalities should have follow-up, including laboratory testing, if necessary. Routine laboratory monitoring for toxicity in people with normal baseline measurements is generally not necessary.</p>

<a name="section-6.6.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Rifampin</h3>
<p class="First">Healthy subjects who received rifampin 600 mg once daily concomitantly with saquinavir 1000 mg/ritonavir 100 mg twice daily (ritonavir-boosted saquinavir) developed severe hepatocellular toxicity. Therefore, concomitant use of these medications is contraindicated. (See <a href="#Contraindications">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>.)</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-6.6.1.1"></a><p></p>
<h4>Enzyme Induction</h4>
<p class="First">Rifampin is known to induce certain cytochrome P-450 enzymes. Coadministration of RIFAMATE, because it contains rifampin, with drugs that undergo biotransformation through these metabolic pathways may accelerate elimination. To maintain optimum therapeutic blood levels, dosages of drugs metabolized by these enzymes may require adjustment when starting or stopping concomitantly administered rifampin.</p>
<p>Rifampin has been reported to substantially decrease the plasma concentrations of the following antiviral drugs: atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, saquinavir, and tipranavir. These antiviral drugs must not be co-administered with rifampin. (See <a href="#Contraindications">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>.)</p>
<p>Rifampin has been reported to accelerate the metabolism of the following drugs: anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin), digitoxin, antiarrhythmics (e.g., disopyramide, mexiletine, quinidine, tocainide), oral anticoagulants, antifungals (e.g., fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole), barbiturates, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers (e.g., diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil), chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, corticosteroids, cyclosporine, cardiac glycoside preparations, clofibrate, oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives, dapsone, diazepam, doxycycline, fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin), haloperidol, oral hypoglycemic agents (sulfonylureas), levothyroxine, methadone, narcotic analgesics, progestins, quinine, tacrolimus, theophylline tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline, nortriptyline) and zidovudine. It may be necessary to adjust dosages of these drugs if they are given concurrently with RIFAMATE since it contains rifampin.</p>
<p>Patients using oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives should be advised to change to nonhormonal methods of birth control during rifampin therapy.</p>
<p>Rifampin has been observed to increase the requirements for anticoagulant drugs of the coumarin type. In patients receiving anticoagulants and RIFAMATE concurrently, it is recommended that the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time be performed daily or as frequently as necessary to establish and maintain the required dose of anticoagulant.</p>
<p>When the two drugs were taken concomitantly, decreased concentrations of atovaquone and increased concentrations of rifampin were observed.</p>
<p>Concurrent use of ketoconazole and rifampin has resulted in decreased serum concentration of both drugs. Concurrent use of rifampin and enalapril has resulted in decreased concentrations of enalaprilat, the active metabolite of enalapril. Since RIFAMATE contains rifampin, dosage adjustments should be made if RIFAMATE is concurrently administered with ketoconazole or enalapril if indicated by the patient's clinical condition.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-6.6.1.2"></a><p></p>
<h4>Other Interactions</h4>
<p class="First">Concomitant antacid administration may reduce the absorption of rifampin. Daily doses of RIFAMATE, because it contains rifampin, should be given at least 1 hour before the ingestion of antacids.</p>
<p>Probenecid and cotrimoxazole have been reported to increase the blood level of rifampin.</p>
<p>When rifampin is given concomitantly with either halothane or isoniazid the potential for hepatotoxicity is increased. The concomitant use of RIFAMATE, because it contains both rifampin and isoniazid, and halothane should be avoided. Patients receiving both rifampin and isoniazid as in RIFAMATE should be monitored closely for hepatotoxicity. (See the <a href="#box">boxed WARNING</a>).</p>
<p>Plasma concentrations of sulfapyridine may be reduced following the concomitant administration of sulfasalazine and RIFAMATE, because it contains rifampin. This finding may be the result of alteration in the colonic bacteria responsible for the reduction of sulfasalazine to sulfapyridine and mesalamine.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-6.6.2"></a><p></p>
<h3>Isoniazid</h3>
<p class="First">Enzyme Inhibition: Isoniazid is known to inhibit certain cytochrome P-450 enzymes. Coadministration of isoniazid with drugs that undergo biotransformation through these metabolic pathways may decrease elimination. Consequently, dosages of drugs metabolized by these enzymes may require adjustment when starting or stopping concomitantly administered RIFAMATE, because it contains isoniazid, to maintain optimum therapeutic blood levels.</p>
<p>Isoniazid has been reported to inhibit the metabolism of the following drugs: anticonvulsants (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone, valproic acid), benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam), haloperidol, ketoconazole, theophylline, and warfarin. It may be necessary to adjust the dosages of these drugs if they are given concurrently with RIFAMATE because it contains isoniazid. The impact of the competing effects of rifampin and isoniazid on the metabolism of these drugs is unknown.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-6.6.2.1"></a><p></p>
<h4>Other Interactions</h4>
<p class="First">Concomitant antacid administration may reduce the absorption of isoniazid. Ingestion with food may also reduce the absorption of isoniazid. Daily doses of RIFAMATE, because it contains isoniazid, should be given on an empty stomach at least 1 hour before the ingestion of antacids or food.</p>
<p>Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone) may decrease the serum concentration of isoniazid by increasing acetylation rate and/or renal clearance. Para-aminosalicylic acid may increase the plasma concentration and elimination half-life of isoniazid by competition of acetylating enzymes.</p>

<h4><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">Pharmacodynamic Interactions</span></h4>
<p class="First">Daily ingestion of alcohol may be associated with a higher incidence of isoniazid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span>. Isoniazid, when given concomitantly with rifampin, has been reported to increase the hepatotoxicity of both drugs.

<a name="section-6.7.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Rifampin</h3>
<p class="First">Cross-reactivity and false-positive urine screening tests for opiates have been reported in patients receiving rifampin when using the KIMS (Kinetic Interaction of Microparticles in Solution) method (e.g., Abuscreen OnLine opiates assay; Roche Diagnostic Systems). Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> spectrometry, will distinguish rifampin from opiates.</p>
<p>Therapeutic levels of rifampin have been shown to inhibit standard microbiological assays for serum folate and vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span>. Therefore, alternative assay methods should be considered. Transient abnormalities in liver function tests (e.g., elevation in serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and serum transaminases), and reduced biliary excretion of contrast media used for visualization of the gallbladder have also been observed. Therefore, these tests should be performed before the morning dose of RIFAMATE.</p>
<p>Rifampin and isoniazid have been reported to alter vitamin D metabolism. In some cases, reduced levels of circulating 25-hydroxy vitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D have been accompanied by reduced serum calcium and phosphate, and elevated parathyroid hormone.</p>

<h2>Treatment</h2>
<p class="First">The airway should be secured and adequate respiratory exchange established. Only then should gastric emptying (lavage-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span>) be attempted; this may be difficult because of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>. Since <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> are likely to be present, gastric lavage is probably preferable to induction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span>.</p>
<p>Blood samples should be obtained for immediate determination of gases, electrolytes, BUN, glucose, etc. Blood should be typed and crossmatched in preparation for possible hemodialysis.</p>
<p>Gastric lavage within the first 2 to 3 hours after ingestion should not be attempted until <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> are under control. To treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>, administer IV diazepam or short-acting barbiturates, and IV pyridoxine (usually 1 mg/1 mg isoniazid ingested). Activated charcoal slurry instilled into the stomach following evacuation of gastric contents can help absorb any remaining drug in the GI tract. Antiemetic medication may be required to control severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>.</p>
<p>RAPID CONTROL OF <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">METABOLIC ACIDOSIS</span> IS FUNDAMENTAL TO  MANAGEMENT. Intravenous sodium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span> should be given at once and repeated as needed, adjusting subsequent dosage on the basis of laboratory findings (i.e., serum sodium, pH, etc.). </p>
<p>Forced osmotic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span> must be started early and should be continued for some hours after clinical improvement to hasten renal clearance of drug and help prevent relapse. Fluid intake and output should be monitored.</p>
<p>Bile drainage may be indicated in presence of serious impairment of hepatic function lasting more than 24–48 hours. Under these circumstances and for severe cases, extracorporeal hemodialysis may be required; if this is not available, peritoneal dialysis can be used along with forced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span>.</p>
<p>Along with measures based on initial and repeated determination of blood gases and other laboratory tests as needed, meticulous respiratory and other intensive care should be utilized to protect against <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="253506" conceptname="Pneumonitis">pneumonitis</span>, etc.</p>
<p>Untreated or inadequately treated cases of gross isoniazid overdosage can terminate fatally, but good response has been reported in most patients brought under adequate treatment within the first few hours after drug ingestion.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">A three-drug regimen consisting of rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide (e.g., RIFATER®) is recommended in the initial phase of short-course therapy which is usually continued for 2 months. The Advisory Council for the Elimination of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">Tuberculosis</span>, the American Thoracic Society, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that either streptomycin or ethambutol be added as a fourth drug in a regimen containing isoniazid (INH), rifampin, and pyrazinamide for initial treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span> unless the likelihood of INH or rifampin resistance is very low. The need for a fourth drug should be reassessed when the results of susceptibility testing are known. If community rates of INH resistance are currently less than 4%, an initial treatment regimen with less than four drugs may be considered.</p>
<p>Following the initial phase, treatment should be continued with RIFAMATE for at least 4 months. Treatment should be continued for longer if the patient is still <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4102774" conceptname="Productive cough">sputum</span> or culture positive, if resistant organisms are present, or if the patient is HIV positive.</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of pyridoxine (B<span class="Sub">6</span>) is recommended in the malnourished, in those predisposed to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197608" conceptname="Peripheral neuritis in pregnancy">neuropathy</span> (e.g., alcoholics and diabetics), and in adolescents.</p>
