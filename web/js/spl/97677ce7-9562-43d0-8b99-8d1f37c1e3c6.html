<h2>Subjective Effects:</h2>
<p class="First">Comparisons of buprenorphine with full agonists such as methadone 
and hydromorphone suggest that sublingual buprenorphine produces typical opioid 
agonist effects which are limited by a ceiling effect.</p>
<p>In non-dependent subjects, acute sublingual doses of SUBOXONE tablets 
produced opioid agonist effects, which reached a maximum between doses of 8 mg 
and 16mg of SUBUTEX. The effects of 16mg SUBOXONE were similar to those produced 
by 16mg SUBUTEX (buprenorphine alone).</p>
<p>Opioid agonist ceiling effects were also observed in a double-blind, parallel 
group, dose ranging comparison of single doses of buprenorphine sublingual 
solution (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg), placebo, and a full agonist control at 
various doses. The treatments were given in ascending dose order at intervals of 
at least one week to 16 opioid-experienced, non-dependent subjects. Both drugs 
produced typical opioid agonist effects. For all the measures for which the 
drugs produced an effect, buprenorphine produced a dose-related response but, in 
each case, there was a dose that produced no further effect. In contrast, the 
highest dose of the full agonist control always produced the greatest effects. 
Agonist objective rating scores remained elevated for the higher doses of 
buprenorphine (8-32 mg) longer than for the lower doses and did not return to 
baseline until 48 hours after drug administrations. The onset of effects 
appeared more rapidly with buprenorphine than with the full agonist control, 
with most doses nearing peak effect after 100 minutes for buprenorphine compared 
to 150 minutes for the full agonist control.</p>

<h2>Physiologic Effects:</h2>
<p class="First">Buprenorphine in intravenous (2mg, 4mg, 8mg, 12mg and 16 mg) and 
sublingual (12mg) doses has been administered to non-dependent subjects to 
examine cardiovascular, respiratory and subjective effects at doses comparable 
to those used for treatment of opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>. Compared with placebo, there 
were no statistically significant differences among any of the treatment 
conditions for blood pressure, heart rate, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4313591" conceptname="Respiratory rate">respiratory rate</span>, O<span class="Sub">2</span> saturation or skin temperature across time. Systolic BP was 
higher in the 8 mg group than placebo (3 hour AUC values). Minimum and maximum 
effects were similar across all treatments. Subjects remained responsive to low 
voice and responded to computer prompts. Some subjects showed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, but 
no other changes were observed.</p>
<p>The respiratory effects of sublingual buprenorphine were compared with the 
effects of methadone in a double-blind, parallel group, dose ranging comparison 
of single doses of buprenorphine sublingual solution (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg) 
and oral methadone (15, 30, 45, or 60 mg) in non-dependent, opioid-experienced 
volunteers. In this study, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312603" conceptname="Hypoventilation">hypoventilation</span> not requiring medical intervention 
was reported more frequently after buprenorphine doses of 4 mg and higher than 
after methadone. Both drugs decreased O<span class="Sub">2</span> saturation to 
the same degree.</p>

<a name="section-3.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Effect of Naloxone:</h2>
<p class="First">Physiologic and subjective effects following acute sublingual administration of 
SUBOXONE and SUBUTEX tablets were similar at equivalent dose levels of 
buprenorphine. Naloxone, in the SUBOXONE formulation, had no clinically 
significant effect when administered by the sublingual route, although blood 
levels of the drug were measurable. SUBOXONE, when administered sublingually 
even to an opioid-dependent population, was recognized as an opioid agonist, 
whereas when administered intramuscularly, combinations of buprenorphine with 
naloxone produced opioid antagonist actions similar to naloxone. In 
methadone-maintained patients and heroin-dependent subjects, intravenous 
administration of buprenorphine/naloxone combinations precipitated opioid 
withdrawal and was perceived as unpleasant and dysphoric. In morphine-stabilized 
subjects, intravenously administered combinations of buprenorphine with naloxone 
produced opioid antagonist and withdrawal effects that were ratio-dependent; the 
most intense withdrawal effects were produced by 2:1 and 4:1 ratios, less 
intense by an 8:1 ratio. SUBOXONE tablets contain buprenorphine with naloxone at 
a ratio of 4:1.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics:</h2>
<a href="http://"></a>Absorption:<p class="First">Plasma levels of buprenorphine increased with the sublingual dose 
of SUBUTEX and SUBOXONE, and plasma levels of naloxone increased with the 
sublingual dose of SUBOXONE (<a href="#t1">Table 1</a>). There was a wide 
inter-patient variability in the sublingual absorption of buprenorphine and 
naloxone, but within subjects the variability was low. Both C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of buprenorphine increased in a linear fashion with 
the increase in dose (in the range of 4 to 16 mg), although the increase was not 
directly dose-proportional.</p>
<p>Naloxone did not affect the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and both 
SUBUTEX and SUBOXONE deliver similar plasma concentrations of buprenorphine. The 
levels of naloxone were too low to assess dose-proportionality. At the three 
naloxone doses of 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg, levels above the limit of quantitation 
(0.05 ng/mL) were not detected beyond 2 hours in seven of eight subjects. In one 
individual, at the 4mg dose, the last measurable concentration was at 8 hours. 
Within each subject (for most of the subjects), across the doses there was a 
trend toward an increase in naloxone concentrations with increase in dose. Mean 
peak naloxone levels ranged from 0.11 to 0.28ng/mL in the dsose range of 1-4 
mg.</p>

<h2>Drug-drug interactions:</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers:</span> A pharmacokinetic 
interaction study of ketoconazole (400 mg/day), a potent inhibitor of CYP 3A4, 
in 12 patients stabilized on SUBOXONE [8mg (n=1) or 12mg (n=5) or 16mg (n=6)] 
resulted in increases in buprenorphine mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> values 
(from 4.3 to 9.8, 6.3 to 14.4 and 9.0 to 17.1) and mean AUC values (from 30.9 to 
46.9, 41.9 to 83.2 and 52.3 to 120) respectively. Subjects receiving SUBUTEX or 
SUBOXONE should be closely monitored and may require dose-reduction if 
inhibitors of CYP 3A4 such as azole antifungal agents (e.g. ketoconazole), 
macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin) and HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. 
ritonavir, indinavir and saquinavir) are co-administered. The interaction of 
buprenorphine with CYP 3A4 inducers has not been investigated; therefore it is 
recommended that patients receiving SUBUTEX or SUBOXONE should be closely 
monitored if inducers of CYP 3A4 (e.g. phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, 
rifampicin) are co-administered (SEE <a href="#section-8">WARNINGS</a>).</p>

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First">Clinical data on the safety and efficacy of SUBOXONE and SUBUTEX 
are derived from studies of buprenorphine sublingual tablet formulations, with 
and without naloxone, and from studies of sublingual administration of a more 
bioavailable ethanolic solution of buprenorphine.</p>
<p>SUBOXONE tablets have been studied in 575 patients, SUBUTEX tablets in 1834 
patients and buprenorphine sublingual solutions in 2470 patients. A total of 
1270 females have received buprenorphine in clinical trials. Dosing 
recommendations are based on data from one trial of both tablet formulations and 
two trials of the ethanolic solution. All trials used buprenorphine in 
conjunction with psychosocial counseling as part of a comprehensive addiction 
treatment program. There have been no clinical studies conducted to assess the 
efficacy of buprenorphine as the only component of treatment.</p>
<p>In a double blind placebo- and active controlled study, 326 heroin-addicted 
subjects were randomly assigned to either SUBOXONE 16 mg per day, 16 mg SUBUTEX 
per day or placebo tablets. For subjects randomized to either active treatment, 
dosing began with one 8 mg tablet of SUBUTEX on Day 1, followed by 16 mg (two 8 
mg tablets) of SUBUTEX on Day 2. On Day 3, those randomized to receive SUBOXONE 
were switched to the combination tablet. Subjects randomized to placebo received 
one placebo tablet on Day 1 and two placebo tablets per day thereafter for four 
weeks. Subjects were seen daily in the clinic (Monday through Friday) for dosing 
and efficacy assessments. Take-home doses were provided for weekends. Subjects 
were instructed to hold the medication under the tongue for approximately 5 to 
10 minutes until completely dissolved. Subjects received one hour of individual 
counseling per week and a single session of HIV education. The primary study 
comparison was to assess the efficacy of SUBUTEX and SUBOXONE individually 
against placebo. The percentage of thrice-weekly urine samples that were 
negative for non-study opioids was statistically higher for both SUBUTEX and 
SUBOXONE, than for placebo.</p>
<p>In a double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study comparing buprenorphine 
ethanolic solution to a full agonist active control, 162 subjects were 
randomized to receive the ethanolic sublingual solution of buprenorphine at 8 
mg/day (a dose which is roughly comparable to a dose of 12 mg/day of SUBUTEX or 
SUBOXONE), or two relatively low doses of active control, one of which was low 
enough to serve as an alternative to placebo, during a 3-10 day induction phase, 
a 16-week maintenance phase and a 7-week detoxification phase. Buprenorphine was 
titrated to maintenance dose by Day 3; active control doses were titrated more 
gradually.</p>
<p>Maintenance dosing continued through Week 17, and then medications were 
tapered by approximately 20-30% per week over Weeks 18-24, with placebo dosing 
for the last two weeks. Subjects received individual and/or group counseling 
weekly.</p>
<p>Based on retention in treatment and the percentage of thrice-weekly urine 
samples negative for non-study opioids, buprenorphine was more effective than 
the low dose of the control, in keeping heroin addicts in treatment and in 
reducing their use of opioids while in treatment. The effectiveness of 
buprenorphine, 8 mg per day was similar to that of the moderate active control 
dose, but equivalence was not demonstrated.</p>
<p>In a dose-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, 16-week study, 731 
subjects were randomized to receive one of four doses of buprenorphine ethanolic 
solution. Buprenorphine was titrated to maintenance doses over 1-4 days (<a href="#t2">Table 2</a>) and continued for 16 weeks. Subjects received at least 
one session of AIDS education and additional counseling ranging from one hour 
per month to one hour per week, depending on site.</p>

<p>Based on retention in treatment and the percentage of thrice-weekly urine 
samples negative for non-study opioids, the three highest tested doses were 
superior to the 1 mg dose. Therefore, this study showed that a range of 
buprenorphine doses may be effective. The 1 mg dose of buprenorphine sublingual 
solution can be considered to be somewhat lower than a 2 mg tablet dose. The 
other doses used in the study encompass a range of tablet doses from 
approximately 6 mg to approximately 24 mg.</p>

<h2>Use in Ambulatory Patients:</h2>
<p class="First">SUBOXONE and SUBUTEX may impair the mental or physical abilities required for 
the performance of potentially dangerous tasks such as driving a car or 
operating machinery, especially during drug induction and dose adjustment. 
Patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including 
automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that buprenorphine therapy does

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Enter section text here</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-8.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>General:</h2>
<p class="First">SUBOXONE and SUBUTEX should be administered with caution in 
elderly or debilitated patients and those with severe impairment of hepatic, 
pulmonary, or renal function; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4182596" conceptname="Myxedema">myxedema</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140673" conceptname="Hypothyroidism">hypothyroidism</span>, adrenal cortical

psychoses; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198803" conceptname="Benign prostatic hyperplasia">prostatic hypertrophy</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="195590" conceptname="Urethral stricture">urethral stricture</span>; acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218106" conceptname="Alcoholism">alcoholism</span>; 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377830" conceptname="Alcohol withdrawal delirium">delirium tremens</span>; or kyphoscoliosis.</p>
<p>The effect of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> on the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and 
naloxone is unknown. Since both drugs are extensively metabolized, the plasma 
levels will be expected to be higher in patients with moderate and severe 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>. However, it is not known whether both drugs are affected to 
the same degree. Therefore, dosage should be adjusted and patients should be 
watched for symptoms of precipitated opioid withdrawal.</p>
<p>Buprenorphine has been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure, as do 
other opioids, and thus should be administered with caution to patients with 
dysfunction of the biliary tract.</p>
<p>As with other mu-opioid receptor agonists, the administration of SUBOXONE or 
SUBUTEX may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute 
abdominal conditions.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34073-7">
<a name="section-8.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Drug Interactions:</h2>
<p class="First">Buprenorphine is metabolized to norbuprenorphine by cytochrome 
CYP 3A4. Because CYP 3A4 inhibitors may increase plasma concentrations of 
buprenorphine, patients already on CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals 
(e.g. ketoconazole), macrolide antibiotics (e.g. erythromycin), and HIV protease 
inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir, indinavir and saquinavir) should have their dose of 
SUBUTEX or SUBOXONE adjusted.</p>
<p>Based on anecdotal reports, there may be an interaction between buprenorphine 
and benzodiazepines. There have been a number of reports in the post-marketing 
experience of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> associated with the concomitant intravenous misuse 
of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines by addicts. In many of these cases, 
buprenorphine was misused by self-injection of crushed SUBUTEX tablets. SUBUTEX 
and SUBOXONE should be prescribed with caution to patients on benzodiazepines or 
other drugs that act on the central nervous system, regardless of whether these 
drugs are taken on the advice of a physician or are taken as drugs of abuse. 
Patients should be warned of the potential danger of the intravenous 
self-administration of benzodiazepines while under treatment with SUBOXONE or 
SUBUTEX.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-8.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Information for Patients:</h2>
<p class="First">Patients should inform their family members that, in the event of 
emergency, the treating physician or emergency room staff should be informed 
that the patient is physically dependent on narcotics and that the patient is 
being treated with SUBOXONE or SUBUTEX.</p>
<p>Patients should be cautioned that a serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> may occur if 
benzodiazepines, sedatives, tranquilizers, antidepressants, or alcohol are taken 
at the same time as SUBOXONE or SUBUTEX.</p>
<p>SUBOXONE and SUBUTEX may impair the mental or physical abilities required for 
the performance of potentially dangerous tasks such as driving a car or 
operating machinery, especially during drug induction and dose adjustment. 
Patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including 
automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that buprenorphine therapy does 
not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities. Like other 
opioids, SUBOXONE and SUBUTEX may produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span> in ambulatory

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility:</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Carcinogenicity:</span> Carcinogenicity data 
on SUBOXONE are not available. Carcinogenicity studies of buprenorphine were 
conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats and CD-1 mice. Buprenorphine was administered 
in the diet to rats at doses of 0.6, 5.5, and 56 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure 
was approximately 0.4, 3 and 35 times the recommended human daily sublingual 
dose of 16 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) for 27 months. 
Statistically significant dose-related increases in testicular interstitial 
(Leydig's) cell tumors occurred, according to the trend test adjusted for 
survival. Pair-wise comparison of the high dose against control failed to show 
statistical significance. In an 86-week study in CD-1 mice, buprenorphine was 
not carcinogenic at dietary doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure was 
approximately 30 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a 
mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Mutagenicity:<a href="http://"></a><p>SUBOXONE: The 4:1 combination of buprenorphine and naloxone was

<h2>Pregnancy:</h2>
<a href="http://"></a>Pregnancy Category C:<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Teratogenic effects:<p class="First">SUBOXONE: Effects on embryo-fetal development were studied in 
Sprague-Dawley rats and Russian white rabbits following oral (1:1) and 
intramuscular (3:2) administration of mixtures of buprenorphine and naloxone. 
Following oral administration to rats and rabbits, no teratogenic effects were 
observed at doses up to 250 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day, respectively (estimated 
exposure was approximately 150 times and 50 times, respectively, the recommended 
human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). 
No definitive drug-related teratogenic effects were observed in rats and rabbits 
at intramuscular doses up to 30 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure was approximately 
20 times and 35 times, respectively, the recommended human daily dose of 16 mg 
on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). Acephalus was observed in one rabbit 
fetus from the low-dose group and omphacele was observed in two rabbit fetuses 
from the same litter in the mid-dose group; no findings were observed in fetuses 
from the high-dose group. Following oral administration to the rat, dose-related 
post-implantation losses, evidenced by increases in the numbers of early 
resorptions with consequent reductions in the numbers of fetuses, were observed 
at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater (estimated exposure was approximately 6 
times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). In the rabbit, increased post-implantation losses 
occurred at an oral dose of 40 mg/kg/day. Following intramuscular administration 
in the rat and the rabbit, post-implantation losses, as evidenced by decreases 
in live fetuses and increases in resorptions, occurred at 30 mg/kg/day.</p>
<p>SUBUTEX: Buprenorphine was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits after <span class="Italics">im</span> or <span class="Italics">sc</span> doses up to 5 mg/kg/day 
(estimated exposure was approximately 3 and 6 times, respectively, the 
recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis), after <span class="Italics">iv</span> doses up to 0.8 
mg/kg/day (estimated exposure was approximately 0.5 times and equal to, 
respectively, the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a 
mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis), or after oral doses up to 160 mg/kg/day in 
rats (estimated exposure was approximately 95 times the recommended human daily 
sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) and 25 
mg/kg/day in rabbits (estimated exposure was approximately 30 times the 
recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). Significant increases in skeletal abnormalities 
(e.g., extra thoracic vertebra or thoraco-lumbar ribs) were noted in rats after 
<span class="Italics">sc</span> administration of 1 mg/kg/day and up (estimated 
exposure was approximately 0.6 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose 
of 16 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis), but were not observed at oral 
doses up to 160 mg/kg/day. Increases in skeletal abnormalities in rabbits after 
<span class="Italics">im</span> administration of 5 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure 
was approximately 6 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg 
on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) or oral administration of 1 mg/kg/day 
or greater (estimated exposure was approximately equal to the recommended human 
daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) were not 
statistically significant.</p>
<p>In rabbits, buprenorphine produced statistically significant pre-implantation 
losses at oral doses of 1 mg/kg/day or greater and post-implantation losses that 
were statistically significant at <span class="Italics">iv</span> doses of 0.2 
mg/kg/day or greater (estimated exposure was approximately 0.3 times the

<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of SUBOXONE or SUBUTEX in 
pregnant women. SUBOXONE or SUBUTEX should only be used during pregnancy if the

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Non-teratogenic effects.<p>Dystocia was noted in pregnant rats treated <span class="Italics">im</span> with buprenorphine 5 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times 
the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). Both fertility and peri- and postnatal development 
studies with buprenorphine in rats indicated increases in neonatal mortality 
after oral doses of 0.8 mg/kg/day and up (approximately 0.5 times the

<h2>Nursing Mothers:</h2>
<p class="First">An apparent lack of milk production during general reproduction studies with 
buprenorphine in rats caused decreased viability and lactation indices. Use of 
high doses of sublingual buprenorphine in pregnant women showed that 
buprenorphine passes into the mother's milk. Breast-feeding is therefore not 
advised in mothers treated with SUBUTEX or SUBOXONE.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">The safety of SUBOXONE has been evaluated in 497 opioid-dependent 
subjects. The prospective evaluation of SUBOXONE was supported by clinical 
trials using SUBUTEX (buprenorphine tablets without naloxone) and other trials 
using buprenorphine sublingual solutions. In total, safety data are available 
from 3214 opioid-dependent subjects exposed to buprenorphine at doses in the 
range used in treatment of opioid addiction.</p>
<p>Few differences in adverse event profile were noted between SUBOXONE and 
SUBUTEX or buprenorphine administered as a sublingual solution.</p>
<p>In a comparative study, adverse event profiles were similar for subjects 
treated with 16 mg SUBOXONE or 16mg SUBUTEX. The following adverse events were

<h1>DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></h1>
<p class="First">SUBOXONE and SUBUTEX are controlled as Schedule III narcotics 
under the Controlled Substances Act.</p>
<p>Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and chronic 
administration produces <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> of the opioid type, characterized by moderate 
withdrawal upon abrupt discontinuation or rapid taper. The withdrawal syndrome 
is milder than seen with full agonists, and may be delayed in onset (SEE <a href="#section-8">WARNINGS</a>)</p>
<p>Neonatal withdrawal has been reported in the infants of women treated with 
SUBUTEX during pregnancy (See <a href="#section-9">PRECAUTIONS</a>)</p>
<p>SUBOXONE contains naloxone and if misused parenterally, is highly likely to 
produce marked and intense withdrawal symptoms in subjects dependent on other 
opioid agonists.</p>

monitored carefully. In the event of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> of respiratory or cardiac 
function, primary attention should be given to the re-establishment of adequate 
respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and institution of 
assisted or controlled ventilation. Oxygen, intravenous fluids, vasopressors, 
and other supportive measures should be employed as indicated.</p>
<p>IN THE CASE OF <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">OVERDOSE</span>, THE PRIMARY MANAGEMENT SHOULD BE THE 
RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF ADEQUATE VENTILATION WlTH MECHANICAL ASSISTANCE OF

<p>High doses of naloxone hydrochloride. 10-35 mg/70 kg may be of limited value 
in the management of buprenorphine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>.. Doxapram (a respiratory stimulant)

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34068-7">
<a name="section-12"></a><p></p>
<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">SUBUTEX or SUBOXONE is administered sublingually as a single daily dose in the 
range of 12 to 16mg/ day. When taken sublingually, SUBOXONE and SUBUTEX have 
similar clinical effects and are interchangeable. There are no adequate and 
well-controlled studies using SUBOXONE as initial medication. SUBUTEX contains 
no naloxone and is preferred for use during induction. Following induction, 
SUBOXONE, due to the presence of naloxone, is preferred when clinical use 
includes unsupervised administration. The use of SUBUTEX for unsupervised 
administration should be limited to those patients who cannot tolerate SUBOXONE, 
for example those patients who have been shown to be hypersensitive to naloxone.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-12.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Method of administration:</h2>
<p class="First">SUBOXONE and SUBUTEX tablets should be placed under the tongue 
until they are dissolved.</p>
<p>For doses requiring the use of more than two tablets, patients are advised to 
either place all the tablets at once or alternatively (if they cannot fit in 
more than two tablets comfortably) place two tablets at a time under the tongue. 
Either way, the patients should continue to hold the tablets under the tongue 
until they dissolve; swallowing the tablets reduces the bioavailability of the 
drug. To ensure consistency in bioavailability, patients should follow the same 
manner of dosing with continued use of the product.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Induction:<p>Prior to induction, consideration should be given to the type of 
opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> (i.e. long- or short-acting opioid), the time since last 
opioid use, and the degree or level of opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>. To avoid precipitating 
withdrawal, induction with SUBUTEX should be undertaken when objective and clear 
signs of withdrawal are evident.</p>
<p>In a one-month study of SUBOXONE tablets induction was conducted with SUBUTEX 
tablets. Patients received 8mg of SUBUTEX on day 1 and 16mg SUBUTEX on day 2. 
From day 3 onward, patients received SUBOXONE tablets at the same buprenorphine 
dose as day 2. Induction in the studies of buprenorphine solution was 
accomplished over 3-4 days, depending on the target dose. In some studies, 
gradual induction over several days led to a high rate of drop-out of 
buprenorphine patients during the induction period. Therefore it is recommended 
that an adequate maintenance dose, titrated to clinical effectiveness, should be 
achieved as rapidly as possible to prevent undue opioid withdrawal 
symptoms.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Patients taking heroin or other short-acting 
opioids:<p>At treatment initiation, the dose of SUBUTEX should be 
administered at least 4 hours after the patient last used opioids or preferably 
when early signs of opioid withdrawal appear.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Patients on methadone or other long-acting 
opioids:<p>There is little controlled experience with the transfer of 
methadone-maintained patients to buprenorphine. Available evidence suggests that 
withdrawal symptoms are possible during induction to buprenorphine treatment. 
Withdrawal appears more likely in patients maintained on higher doses of 
methadone (&gt;30mg) and when the first buprenorphine dose is administered 
shortly after the last methadone dose.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Maintenance:<p>SUBOXONE is the preferred medication for maintenance treatment 
due to the presence of naloxone in the formulation.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Adjusting the dose until the maintenance dose is 
achieved:<p>The recommended target dose of SUBOXONE is 16 mg/day. Clinical 
studies have shown that 16mg of SUBUTEX or SUBOXONE is a clinically effective 
dose compared with placebo and indicate that doses as low as 12 mg may be 
effective in some patients. The dosage of SUBOXONE should be progressively 
adjusted in increments / decrements of 2mg or 4mg to a level that holds the 
patient in treatment and suppresses opioid withdrawal effects. This is likely to 
be in the range of 4mg to 24mg per day depending on the individual.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Reducing dosage and stopping treatment:<p>The decision to discontinue therapy with SUBOXONE or SUBUTEX 
after a period of maintenance or brief stabilization should be made as part of a 
comprehensive treatment plan. Both gradual and abrupt discontinuation have been 
used, but no controlled trials have been undertaken to determine the best method 
of dose taper at the end of treatment.</p>
