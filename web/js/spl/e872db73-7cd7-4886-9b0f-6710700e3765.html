<h2>Pharmacodynamics
</h2>
<p class="First">There are no studies examining the inhibition of the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) in human skin following the application of topical eflornithine. However, there are studies in the literature that report the inhibition of ODC activity in skin following oral eflornithine. It is postulated that topical eflornithine hydrochloride irreversibly inhibits skin ODC activity. This enzyme is necessary in the synthesis of polyamines. Animal data indicate that inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase inhibits cell division and synthetic functions, which affect the rate of hair growth. <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Sup">Â®</span> (eflornithine hydrochloride) cream, 13.9% has been shown to retard the rate of hair growth in non-clinical and clinical studies.

<h2>Pharmacokinetics
</h2>
<p class="First">The mean percutaneous absorption of eflornithine in women with unwanted facial hair, from a 13.9% w/w cream formulation, is less than 1% of the radioactive dose, following either single or multiple doses under conditions of clinical use, that included shaving within 2 hours before radiolabeled dose application in addition to other forms of cutting or plucking, and tweezing to remove facial hair. Steady state was reached within four days of twice-daily application. The apparent steady-state plasma t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> of eflornithine was approximately 8 hours. Following twice-daily application of 0.5 g of the cream (total dose 1 g/day; 139 mg as anhydrous eflornithine hydrochloride), under conditions of clinical use in women with unwanted facial hair (n=10), the steady-state Cmax, Ctrough and AUC<span class="Sub">12hr</span> were approximately 10 ng/mL, 5 ng/mL, and 92 ngâ€¢hr/mL, respectively, expressed in terms of the anhydrous free base of eflornithine hydrochloride. At steady state, the dose-normalized peak concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) and the extent of daily systemic exposure (AUC) of eflornithine following twice-daily application of 0.5 g of the cream (total dose 1 g/day) is estimated to be approximately 100- and 60-fold lower, when compared to 370 mg/day once-daily oral doses. This compound is not known to be metabolized and is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.

<h1>CLINICAL TRIALS
</h1>
<p class="First">Results of topical dermal studies for contact sensitization, photocontact sensitization, and photocontact irritation reveal that under conditions of clinical use, <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Sup">Â®</span> is not expected to cause contact sensitization, phototoxic, or photosensitization reactions. Results of the topical dermal study for contact irritation did reveal that <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Sup">Â®</span> could cause irritation reactions in clinical use in susceptible individuals or under conditions of exaggerated use.
</p>
<p>Two randomized double-blind studies involving 594 female patients (393 treated with <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Sup">Â®</span>, 201 with vehicle) treated twice daily for up to 24 weeks evaluated the efficacy of <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Sup">Â®</span> in the reduction of unwanted facial hair in women. Women in the trial had a customary frequency of removal of facial hair two or more times per week. Women with facial conditions such as severe inflammatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="141095" conceptname="Acne">acne</span>, women who were pregnant, and nursing mothers were excluded from the studies. Physicians assessed the improvement or worsening from the baseline condition (Physician's Global Assessment [PGA]), 48 hours after shaving, of all treated areas. Statistically significant improvement for <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Sup">Â®</span> (eflornithine hydrochloride) cream, 13.9% versus vehicle was seen in each of these studies for "marked improvement" or greater response (24-week time point; pâ‰¤ 0.001). Marked improvement was seen consistently at 8 weeks after initiation of treatment and continued throughout the 24 weeks of treatment. Hair growth approached pretreatment levels within 8 weeks of treatment withdrawal. The success rate over time is graphically presented below for each pivotal trial.

<p>Subgroup analyses appeared to suggest greater benefit for Whites than non-Whites (37% versus 22% success, respectively; p=0.017). However, non-Whites, mostly Black subjects, did have significant treatment benefit with 22% graded as success on <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Sup">Â®</span> compared to 5% on vehicle.
</p>
<p>About 12% of women in the clinical trials were postmenopausal. Significant improvement in PGA outcome versus vehicle was seen in postmenopausal women (38% compared to 0%, pâ‰¤ 0.001).
</p>
<p><span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Sup">Â®</span> statistically significantly reduced how bothered patients felt by their facial hair and by the time spent removing, treating, or concealing facial hair. These patient-observable differences were seen as early as 8 weeks after initiating treatment. Hair growth approached pretreatment levels within 8 weeks of treatment withdrawal.
</p>
<p>Clinical trials with <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Sup">Â®</span> involved over 1370 women with unwanted facial hair of skin types I-VI, of whom 68% were White, 17% Black, 11% Hispanic-Latino, 2% Asian-Pacific Islander, 0.6% American Native, and 1.3% other.

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility
</h2>
<p class="First">In a 12-month photocarcinogenicity study in hairless albino mice, animals treated with the vehicle alone showed an increased incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135777" conceptname="Neoplasm of uncertain behavior of skin">skin tumors</span> induced by exposure to ultraviolet (UVA/UVB) light, whereas mice treated topically with <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Sup">Â®</span> at doses up to 600 mg/kg [19X the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (BSA)] showed an incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135777" conceptname="Neoplasm of uncertain behavior of skin">skin tumors</span> equivalent to untreated-control animals.
</p>
<p>A 2-year dermal carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice treated with <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Sup">Â®</span> revealed no evidence of carcinogenicity at daily doses up to 600 mg/kg (950X the MRHD based on AUC comparisons).
</p>
<p>Eflornithine did not elicit mutagenic effects in an Ames reverse-mutation assay or clastogenicity in primary human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span>, with and without metabolic activation. In a dermal micronucleus assay, eflornithine hydrochloride cream, 13.9%, at doses up to 900 mg/kg (58X the MRHD based on BSA) in rats yielded no evidence of genotoxicity.
</p>
<p>In a dermal fertility and early embryonic development study in rats treated with <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Sup">Â®</span>, there were no adverse reproductive effects at doses up to 450 mg/kg (29X the MRHD based on BSA). In a peri- and postnatal study in rats, eflornithine administered in the drinking water was associated with maternal toxicity and reduced pup weights at doses of at least 625 mg/kg (40X the MRHD based on BSA) and a slightly reduced fertility index, which was considered to be of questionable biological significance, at 1698 mg/kg (110X the MRHD based on BSA). No effects were seen with an oral dose of 223 mg/kg (14X the MRHD based on BSA). In the latter study, the multiples of the human exposure are likely much higher, since eflornithine is well absorbed orally in rats, whereas minimal absorption occurs in humans treated topically.

<a name="s14"></a><a name="section-8.2.1"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C</span></p>
<p>In the first dermal embryo-fetal development study in rats treated with eflornithine hydrochloride cream, 13.9% (in which no precautions were taken to prevent ingestion of drug from application sites), maternal toxicity and fetal effects including reduced numbers of live fetuses, decreased fetal weights, and delayed ossification and development of the viscera were observed at doses of 225 and 450 mg/kg (15X and 29X the MRHD based on BSA, respectively). When the study was repeated under conditions that avoided ingestion from application sites, no maternal, fetal or teratogenic effects were observed at doses up to 450 mg/kg (29X the MRHD based on BSA). In the first study in which no precautions were taken to prevent ingestion, circulating plasma levels were 11- to 14-fold higher than in the second study in which ingestion was prevented. In a dermal embryo-fetal development study in rabbits treated with <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Sup">Â®</span> (eflornithine hydrochloride) cream, 13.9% no adverse maternal or fetal effects occurred at doses up to 90 mg/kg (11X the MRHD based on BSA). Significant dermal irritation, as well as possible ingestion of <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Sup">Â®</span> occurred at 300 mg/kg/day (36X the MRHD based on BSA) and was associated with maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span>, abortions, increased fetal resorptions, and reduced fetal weights. Fetotoxicity in the absence of maternal toxicity has been reported in oral studies with eflornithine with fetal no-effect doses of 80 mg/kg in rats and 45 mg/kg in rabbits. In these studies, no evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> was observed in rats given up to 200 mg/kg or in rabbits given up to 135 mg/kg.
</p>
<p>Although <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Sup">Â®</span> was not formally studied in pregnant patients, 22 pregnancies occurred during the trials. Nineteen of these pregnancies occurred while patients were using <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Sup">Â®</span>. Of the 19 pregnancies, there were 9 healthy infants, 4 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4067106" conceptname="Miscarriage">spontaneous abortions</span>, 5 induced/elective abortions, and 1 birth defect (Down's Syndrome to a 35-year-old). Because there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, the risk/benefit ratio of using <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Sup">Â®</span> in women with unwanted facial hair who are pregnant should be weighed carefully with serious consideration for either not implementing or discontinuing use of <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Sup">Â®</span>.

<h1>OVERDOSAGE
</h1>
<p class="First">Overdosage information with <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Sup">Â®</span> is unavailable. Given the low percutaneous penetration of this drug, overdosage via the topical route is not expected (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s2">CLINICALÂ PHARMACOLOGY</a></span>). However, should very high topical doses (e.g., multiple tubes per day) or oral ingestion be encountered (a 30 g tube contains 4.2 g of eflornithine hydrochloride), the patient should be monitored, and appropriate supportive measures administered as necessary.
</p>
<p>(Note: Use of an intravenous formulation of eflornithine hydrochloride at high doses (400 mg/kg/day or approximately 24 g/day) for the treatment of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> (African sleeping sickness) has been associated with adverse events and laboratory abnormalities.

<p><span class="Bold">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span></p>
<p>This section contains important information about <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> that you should read before you begin treatment. This section does not list all the benefits and risks of <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> and does not take the place of discussions with your doctor or healthcare professional about your condition or your treatment. If you have questions, talk with your healthcare professional. The medicine described here can only be prescribed by a licensed healthcare professional. Only your healthcare professional can determine if <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> is right for you.
</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What is VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">Â®</span></span><span class="Bold">?</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> (pronounced "VAN-i-ka") is a prescription medication applied to the skin for the reduction of unwanted facial hair in women.
</p>
<p>The active ingredient in <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> is eflornithine hydrochloride. <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> also contains ceteareth-20, cetearyl alcohol, dimethicone, glyceryl stearate, methylparaben, mineral oil, PEG-100 stearate,Â  phenoxyethanol, propylparaben, stearylÂ  alcohol and water.
</p>
<p><span class="Bold">How does VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">Â®
</span></span><span class="Bold">work?</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> interferes with an enzyme found in the hair follicle of the skin needed for hair growth. This results in slower hair growth and improved appearance where <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> is applied.
</p>
<p><span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> does not permanently remove hair or "cure" unwanted facial hair. It is not a depilatory. Your treatment program should include continuation of any hair removal technique you are currently using.
</p>
<p><span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> will help you manage your condition and improve your appearance.
</p>
<p>Improvement in the condition occurs gradually. Don't be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Be patient. Improvement may be seen as early as 4 to 8 weeks of treatment. Improvement may take longer in some individuals. If no improvement is seen after 6 months of use, discontinue use. Clinical studies show that in about 8 weeks after stopping treatment with <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">Â®</span></span>, the hair will return to the same condition as before beginning treatment.
</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Who should not use VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">Â®</span></span><span class="Bold">?</span></p>
<p>You should not use <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> if you are allergic to any of the ingredients in the cream. All ingredients are listed on the tube and at the beginning of this leaflet.
</p>
<p>You should not use <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> if you are less than 12 years of age.
</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What should you tell your doctor before using VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">Â®</span></span><span class="Bold">?</span></p>
<p>If you are allergic to any of the ingredients, tell your doctor.
</p>
<p>If you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, discuss with your doctor whether you should use <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> during pregnancy. No clinical studies have been performed in pregnant women.
</p>
<p>If you are breastfeeding, consult your doctor before using <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">Â®</span></span>. It is not known if <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> is passed to infants through breast milk.
</p>
<p>If you are taking any prescription medicines, non-prescription medicines or using any facial or skin creams, check with your physician before use of <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">Â®</span></span>.
</p>

</p>
<p><span class="Underline">You will need to continue your normal procedures for hair removal</span> until desired results have been achieved. You may then be less bothered by the time spent in removing hair or the frequency of hair removal. <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> is to be used twice daily, at least eight hours apart, or as directed by your doctor. <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> is for external use only.

You should not wash the treatment areas for at least 4 hours after application of <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">Â®</span></span>.

</p>
<p>If you forget or miss a dose of <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">Â®</span></span>, do not try to â€œmake it upâ€?. Return to your normal application schedule as soon as you can.
</p>
<p>You may use your normal cosmetics or sunscreen after applying <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">Â®</span></span>, but you should wait a few minutes to allow the treatment to be absorbed before applying them.
</p>
<p>If your condition gets worse with treatment, stop use of <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> and contact your doctor.
