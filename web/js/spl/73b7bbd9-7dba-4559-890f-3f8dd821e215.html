<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<br><p class="First">Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets are rapidly and completely absorbed following oral administration and have a half-life of about 20 to 40 hours. Peak plasma concentrations are reached within about 2 hours following an oral dose. The presence of food in the stomach has a minimal effect on both the rate and extent of absorption and does not require a dosage adjustment. Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets are bioequivalent to mirtazapine tablets.<br><br>Mirtazapine is extensively metabolized after oral administration. Major pathways of biotransformation are demethylation and hydroxylation followed by glucuronide conjugation. <span class="Italics">In vitro </span>data from human liver microsomes indicate that cytochrome 2D6 and 1A2 are involved in the formation of the 8-hydroxy metabolite of mirtazapine, whereas cytochrome 3A is considered to be responsible for the formation of the N-desmethyl and N-oxide metabolite. Mirtazapine has an absolute bioavailability of about 50%. It is eliminated predominantly via urine (75%) with 15% in feces. Several unconjugated metabolites possess pharmacological activity but are present in the plasma at very low levels. The (-) enantiomer has an elimination half-life that is approximately twice as long as the (+) enantiomer and therefore achieves plasma levels that are about 3 times as high as that of the (+) enantiomer.<br><br>Plasma levels are linearly related to dose over a dose range of 15 to 80 mg. The mean elimination half-life of mirtazapine after oral administration ranges from approximately 20 to 40 hours across age and gender subgroups, with females of all ages exhibiting significantly longer elimination half-lives than males (mean half-life of 37 hours for females vs. 26 hours for males). Steady state plasma levels of mirtazapine are attained within 5 days, with about 50% accumulation (accumulation ratio=1.5). <br><br>Mirtazapine is approximately 85% bound to plasma proteins over a concentration range of 0.01 to 10 mcg/mL.<br><br><span class="Bold">Special Populations</span><br><br><span class="Underline">Geriatric</span><br><br>Following oral administration of mirtazapine tablets 20 mg/day for 7 days to subjects of varying ages (range, 25 to 74), oral clearance of mirtazapine was reduced in the elderly compared to the younger subjects. The differences were most striking in males, with a 40% lower clearance in elderly males compared to younger males, while the clearance in elderly females was only 10% lower compared to younger females. Caution is indicated in administering mirtazapine orally disintegrating tablets to elderly patients (see <a href="#Section_6">PRECAUTIONS</a> and <a href="#Section_10">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).<br><br><span class="Underline">Pediatrics</span><br><br>Safety and effectiveness of mirtazapine in the pediatric population have not been established (see <a href="#Section_6">PRECAUTIONS</a>).<br><br><span class="Underline">Gender</span><br><br>The mean elimination half-life of mirtazapine after oral administration ranges from approximately 20 to 40 hours across age and gender subgroups, with females of all ages exhibiting significantly longer elimination half-lives than males (mean half-life of 37 hours for females vs. 26 hours for males) (see <a href="#Section_2.2">Pharmacokinetics</a>).<br><br><span class="Underline">Race</span><br><br>There have been no clinical studies to evaluate the effect of race on the pharmacokinetics of mirtazapine orally disintegrating tablets.<br><br><span class="Underline"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span></span><br><br>The disposition of mirtazapine was studied in patients with varying degrees of renal function.

Patients were titrated with mirtazapine from a dose range of 5 mg up to 35 mg/day. Overall, these studies demonstrated mirtazapine to be superior to placebo on at least 3 of the following 4 measures: 21-Item Hamilton <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> Rating Scale (HDRS) total score; HDRS <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="40546087" conceptname="Depressed mood">Depressed Mood</span> Item; CGI Severity score; and Montgomery and Asberg <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> Rating Scale (MADRS).

Response during the open phase was defined as having achieved a HAM-D 17 total score of ≤ 8 and a CGI-Improvement score of 1 or 2 at 2 consecutive visits beginning with week 6 of the 8 to 12 weeks in the open-label phase of the study. Relapse during the double-blind phase was determined by the individual investigators. Patients receiving continued mirtazapine treatment experienced significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 40 weeks compared to those receiving placebo. This pattern was demonstrated in both male and female patients.</p>

<br><p class="First">Patients with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and/or the emergence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4092095" conceptname="Planning suicide">suicidal ideation</span> and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> is a known risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. <br><br>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440374" conceptname="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">obsessive compulsive disorder</span> (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1. </p>

<br><p><span class="Bold">ECG Changes</span><br><br>The electrocardiograms for 338 patients who received mirtazapine tablets and 261 patients who received placebo in 6-week, placebo-controlled trials were analyzed. Prolongation in QTc ≥ 500 msec was not observed among mirtazapine -treated patients; mean change in QTc was +1.6 msec for mirtazapine and –3.1 msec for placebo. Mirtazapine was associated with a mean increase in heart rate of 3.4 bpm, compared to 0.8 bpm for placebo. The clinical significance of these changes is unknown.<br><br><span class="Bold">Other Adverse Events Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Mirtazapine</span><br><br>During its premarketing assessment, multiple doses of mirtazapine tablets were administered to 2796 patients in clinical studies. The conditions and duration of exposure to mirtazapine varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) open and double-blind studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, fixed-dose and titration studies. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories.<span><a name="OLE_LINK1"></a><br><br>In the tabulations that follow, reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 2796 patients exposed to multiple doses of mirtazapine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least 1 occasion while receiving mirtazapine. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 4, those adverse experiences subsumed under COSTART terms that are either overly general or excessively specific so as to be uninformative, and those events for which a drug cause was very remote. <br><br>It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported occurred during treatment with mirtazapine, they were not necessarily caused by it.</span><br><br>Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on 1 or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients. Only those events not already listed in Table 4 appear in this listing.

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<br><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Initial Treatment</span><br><br>The recommended starting dose for mirtazapine orally disintegrating tablets is 15 mg/day, administered in a single dose, preferably in the evening prior to sleep. In the controlled clinical trials establishing the efficacy of mirtazapine tablets in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, the effective dose range was generally 15 to 45 mg/day. While the relationship between dose and satisfactory response in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> for mirtazapine has not been adequately explored, patients not responding to the initial 15 mg dose may benefit from dose increases up to a maximum of 45 mg/day. Mirtazapine has an elimination half-life of approximately 20 to 40 hours; therefore, dose changes should not be made at intervals of less than 1 to 2 weeks in order to allow sufficient time for evaluation of the therapeutic response to a given dose.<br><br><span class="Bold">Administration of Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets</span><br><br>Patients should be instructed to open tablet <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443720" conceptname="Blister">blister</span> pack with dry hands and place the tablet on the tongue. The tablet should be used immediately after removal from its <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443720" conceptname="Blister">blister</span> ; once removed, it cannot be stored. Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets will disintegrate rapidly on the tongue and can be swallowed with saliva. No water is needed for taking the tablet. Patients should not attempt to split the tablet.<br><br><span class="Bold">Elderly and Patients with Renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic Impairment</span></span><br><br>The clearance of mirtazapine is reduced in elderly patients and in patients with moderate to severe renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>. Consequently, the prescriber should be aware that plasma mirtazapine levels may be increased in these patient groups, compared to levels observed in younger adults without renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> (see <a href="#Section_6">PRECAUTIONS</a> and <a href="#Section_2">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>). <br><br><span class="Bold">Maintenance/Extended Treatment</span><br><br>It is generally agreed that acute episodes of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> require several months or longer of sustained pharmacological therapy beyond response to the acute episode. Systematic evaluation of mirtazapine tablets has demonstrated that its efficacy in major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> is maintained for periods of up to 40 weeks following 8 to 12 weeks of initial treatment at a dose of 15 to 45 mg/day (see <a href="#Section_2">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>). Based on these limited data, it is unknown whether or not the dose of mirtazapine needed for maintenance treatment is identical to the dose needed to achieve an initial response. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment and the appropriate dose for such treatment.<br><br><span class="Bold">Switching a Patient To or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Intended to Treat Psychiatric Disorders<br></span><br>At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with mirtazapine orally disintegrating tablets. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping mirtazapine orally disintegrating tablets before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders (see <a href="#Section_4">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>).<br><br><span class="Bold">Use of Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets With Other MAOIs, Such as Linezolid or Methylene Blue<br></span><br>Do not start mirtazapine orally disintegrating tablets in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue because there is an increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span>. In a patient who requires more urgent treatment of a psychiatric condition, other interventions, including hospitalization, should be considered (see <a href="#Section_4">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>).<br><br>In some cases, a patient already receiving therapy with mirtazapine orally disintegrating tablets may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span> in a particular patient, mirtazapine orally disintegrating tablets should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered. The patient should be monitored for symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span> for 2 weeks or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, whichever comes first. Therapy with mirtazapine orally disintegrating tablets may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue (see <a href="#Section_5">WARNINGS</a>).<br><br>The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg/kg with mirtazapine orally disintegrating tablets is unclear. The clinician should, nevertheless, be aware of the possibility of emergent symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span> with such use (see <a href="#Section_5">WARNINGS</a>).<br><span class="Bold"><br>Discontinuation of Mirtazapine Treatment<br></span><br>Symptoms associated with the discontinuation or dose reduction of mirtazapine orally disintegrating tablets have been reported. Patients should be monitored for these and other symptoms when discontinuing treatment or during dosage reduction. A gradual reduction in the dose over several weeks, rather than abrupt cessation, is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, dose titration should be managed on the basis of the patient’s clinical response (see <a href="#Section_6">PRECAUTIONS</a> and <a href="#Section_7">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a>).<span class="Bold"><br><br>Information for Patients<br></span><br>Patients should be advised that taking mirtazapine orally disintegrating tablets can cause mild pupillary dilation, which in susceptible individuals, can lead to an episode of angle-closure <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437541" conceptname="Glaucoma">glaucoma</span>.
