<h2>Mechanism of Action<br>
</h2>
<p class="First">Although the exact mechanism of action of bleomycin is unknown, available evidence indicates that the main mode of action is the inhibition of DNA synthesis with some evidence of lesser inhibition of RNA and protein synthesis.</p>
<p>Bleomycin is known to cause single, and to a lesser extent, double-stranded breaks in DNA. Â In <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">in vitro </span></span>and <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">in vivo </span></span>experiments, bleomycin has been shown to cause cell cycle arrest in G2 and in mitosis. </p>
<p>When administered into the pleural cavity in the treatment of malignant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254061" conceptname="Pleural effusion">pleural effusion</span>, bleomycin acts as a sclerosing agent.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics<br>
</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Absorption</span></span></p>
<p>Bleomycin is rapidly absorbed following either intramuscular, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, or intrapleural administration reaching peak plasma concentrations in 30 to 60 minutes. Â Systemic bioavailability of bleomycin is 100% and 70% following intramuscular and subcutaneous administrations, respectively, and 45% following both intraperitoneal and intrapleural administrations, compared to intravenous and bolus administration.</p>
<p>Following intramuscular doses of 1 to 10 units/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, both peak plasma concentration and AUC increased in proportion with the increase of dose.</p>
<p>Following intravenous bolus administration of 30 units of bleomycin to one patient with a primary germ cell tumor of the brain, a peak CSF level was 40% of the simultaneously-obtained plasma level and was attained in 2 hours after drug administration. Â The area under the bleomycin CSF concentration x time curve was 25% of the area of the bleomycin plasma concentration x time curve.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Distribution</span></span></p>
<p>Bleomycin is widely distributed throughout the body with a mean volume of distribution of 17.5 L/m<span class="Sup">2</span> in patients following a 15 units/m<span class="Sup">2</span> intravenous bolus dose. Â Protein binding of bleomycin has not been studied. </p>
<p>Â </p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Metabolism</span></span></p>
<p>Bleomycin is inactivated by a cytosolic cysteine proteinase enzyme, bleomycin hydrolase. Â The enzyme is widely distributed in normal tissues with the exception of the skin and lungs, both targets of bleomycin toxicity. Â Systemic elimination of the drug by enzymatic degradation is probably only important in patients with severely compromised renal function.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Excretion</span></span></p>
<p>The primary route of elimination is via the kidneys. Â About 65% of the administered intravenous dose is excreted in urine within 24 hours. Â In patients with normal renal function, plasma concentrations of bleomycin decline biexponentially with a mean terminal half-life of 2 hours following intravenous bolus administration. Â Total body clearance and renal clearance averaged 51 mL/min/m<span class="Sup">2</span> and 23 mL/min/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, respectively.</p>
<p>Following intrapleural administration to patients with normal renal function, a lower percentage of drug (40%) is recovered in the urine, as compared to that found in the urine after intravenous administration.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Special Populations</span></span></p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Age, Gender, and Race</span></span></p>
<p>The effects of age, gender, and race on the pharmacokinetics of bleomycin have not been evaluated.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Pediatric</span></span></p>
<p>Children of less than 3 years of age have higher total body clearance than in adults, 71 mL/min/m<span class="Sup">2</span> versus 51 mL/min/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, respectively, following intravenous bolus administration. Â Children of more than 8 years of age have comparable clearance as in adults.</p>
<p>In children with normal renal function, plasma concentrations of bleomycin decline biexponentially as in adults. Â The volume of distribution and terminal half-life of bleomycin in children appears comparable to that in adults. </p>
<p>Â </p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal insufficiency</span> markedly alters bleomycin elimination. Â The terminal elimination half-life increases exponentially as the creatinine clearance decreases. Â Dosing reductions were proposed for patients with creatinine clearance values of &lt;50 mL/min (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#fcd5508f-edfb-46ce-8e1f-c0f6114b4344">PRECAUTIONS</a>Â </span></span>and <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#bb1c342a-1ad0-496c-af5e-0a8e9183ab71">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span></span>).</p>

<p>Â </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Drug Interactions</span></span></p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Drugs that Can Affect Renal Clearance</span></span></p>
<p>Because bleomycin is eliminated predominantly through renal excretion, the administration of nephrotoxic drugs with bleomycin may affect its renal clearance.Â  Specifically, in one report of 2 children receiving concomitant cisplatin with bleomycin, total body clearance of bleomycin decreased from 39 to 18 mL/min/m<span class="Sup">2</span> as the cumulative dose of cisplatin exceeded 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>. Â Terminal half-life of bleomycin also increased from 4.4 to 6 hours. Â Fatal bleomycin pulmonary toxicity has been reported in a patient with unrecognized cisplatin-induced oliguric <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span>.</p>

Â Overall survival did not differ between the bleomycin (n=44) and tetracycline treatment (n=41) groups. Â Of patients evaluated within 30 days of instillation, the recurrence rate was 36% (10/28) with bleomycin and 67% (18/27) with tetracycline (p=0.023). Â Toxicity was similar between groups.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First">Patients receiving bleomycin must be observed carefully and frequently during and after therapy. Â It should be used with extreme caution in patients with significant impairment of renal function or compromised pulmonary function.</p>
<p>Pulmonary toxicities occur in 10% of treated patients.Â  In approximately 1%, the nonspecific <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="253506" conceptname="Pneumonitis">pneumonitis</span> induced by bleomycin progresses to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4197819" conceptname="Fibrosis of lung">pulmonary fibrosis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. Although this is age and dose related, the toxicity is unpredictable. Â Frequent roentgenograms are recommended (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#af6a9ecc-0240-4be5-b352-2d914bf5c16a">ADVERSE REACTIONS, </a></span></span><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#af6a9ecc-0240-4be5-b352-2d914bf5c16a">Pulmonary</a></span></span><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">)</span></span>.</p>

<h2>Usage in Pregnancy<br>
</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Pregnancy â€œCategory Dâ€?</span></span></p>
<p>Bleomycin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Â It has been shown to be teratogenic in rats. Â Administration of intraperitoneal doses of 1.5 mg/kg/day to rats (about 1.6 times the recommended human dose on a unit/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) on days 6 to 15 of gestation caused skeletal malformations, shortened innominate artery and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194408" conceptname="Hydroureter">hydroureter</span>. Bleomycin is abortifacient but not teratogenic in rabbits at intravenous doses of 1.2 mg/kg/day (about 2.4 times the recommended human dose on a unit/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) given on gestation days 6 to 18.</p>
<p>There have been no studies in pregnant women. Â If bleomycin is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Â Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during therapy with bleomycin.</p>

<p class="First">The most serious side effects are pulmonary adverse reactions, occurring in approximately 10% of treated patients.Â  The most frequent presentation is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="253506" conceptname="Pneumonitis">pneumonitis</span> occasionally progressing to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4197819" conceptname="Fibrosis of lung">pulmonary fibrosis</span>. Â Approximately 1% of patients treated have died of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4197819" conceptname="Fibrosis of lung">pulmonary fibrosis</span>. Â Pulmonary toxicity is both dose and age related, being more common in patients over 70 years of age and in those receiving over 400 units total dose. Â This toxicity, however, is unpredictable and has been seen in young patients receiving low doses. Â Some published reports have suggested that the risk of pulmonary toxicity may be increased when bleomycin is used in combination with G-CSF (filgrastim) or other cytokines. Â However, randomized clinical studies completed to date have not demonstrated an increased risk of pulmonary complications in patients treated with bleomycin and G-CSF.</p>
<p>Because of lack of specificity of the clinical syndrome, the identification of patients with pulmonary toxicity due to bleomycin has been extremely difficult. Â The earliest symptom associated with bleomycin pulmonary toxicity is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">dyspnea</span>. Â The earliest sign is fine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4167669" conceptname="Respiratory crackles">rales</span>.</p>
<p>Radiographically, bleomycin-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="253506" conceptname="Pneumonitis">pneumonitis</span> produces nonspecific patchy opacities, usually of the lower lung fields. Â The most common changes in pulmonary function tests are a decrease in total lung volume and a decrease in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4147814" conceptname="Vital capacity">vital capacity</span>. However, these changes are not predictive of the development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4197819" conceptname="Fibrosis of lung">pulmonary fibrosis</span>. </p>
<p>The microscopic tissue changes due to bleomycin toxicity include bronchiolar squamous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4070551" conceptname="Metaplasia">metaplasia</span>, reactive macrophages, atypical alveolar epithelial cells, fibrinous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span>, and interstitial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012171" conceptname="Fibrosis">fibrosis</span>. Â The acute stage may involve capillary changes and subsequent fibrinous exudation into alveoli producing a change similar to hyaline membrane formation and progressing to a diffuse interstitial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012171" conceptname="Fibrosis">fibrosis</span> resembling the Hamman-Rich syndrome. Â These microscopic findings are nonspecific; e.g., similar changes are seen in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221865" conceptname="Radiation pneumonitis">radiation pneumonitis</span> and pneumocystic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="253506" conceptname="Pneumonitis">pneumonitis</span>.</p>
<p>To monitor the onset of pulmonary toxicity, roentgenograms of the chest should be taken every 1 to 2 weeks (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#eb21f81f-cd21-4116-b93f-8687963e1cb7">WARNINGS</a></span></span>). Â If pulmonary changes are noted, treatment should be discontinued until it can be determined if they are drug related.Â  Recent studies have suggested that sequential measurement of the pulmonary diffusion capacity for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4198996" conceptname="Carbon monoxide">carbon monoxide</span> (DL<span class="Sub">co</span>) during treatment with bleomycin may be an indicator of subclinical pulmonary toxicity. Â It is recommended that the DL<span class="Sub">co</span> be monitored monthly if it is to be employed to detect pulmonary toxicities, and thus the drug should be discontinued when the DL<span class="Sub">co</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falls</span> below 30% to 35% of the pretreatment value.</p>
<p>Because of bleomycinâ€™s sensitization of lung tissue, patients who have received bleomycin are at greater risk of developing pulmonary toxicity when oxygen is administered in surgery. Â While long exposure to very high oxygen concentrations is a known cause of lung damage, after bleomycin administration, lung damage can occur at lower concentrations that are usually considered safe.Â  Suggested preventive measures are:</p>
<p>Â Â Â  1.Â  Maintain FlO<span class="Sub">2 </span>at concentrations approximating that of room air (25%) during surgery and the postoperative period.</p>
<p>Â Â Â  2.Â  Monitor carefully fluid replacement, focusing more on colloid administration rather than crystalloid.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Sudden onset of an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77670" conceptname="Chest pain">acute chest pain</span> syndrome suggestive of pleuropericarditis has been reported during bleomycin infusions.Â  Although each patient must be individually evaluated, further courses of bleomycin do not appear to be contraindicated.</p>
<p>Pulmonary adverse events which may be related to the intrapleural administration of bleomycin have been reported.</p>

<h2>Intramuscular or Subcutaenous<br>
</h2>
<p class="First">The Bleomycin for Injection 15 units vial should be reconstituted with 1 to 5 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, Sodium Chloride for Injection, 0.9%, USP, or Sterile Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP.

</h2>
<p class="First">The contents of the 15 units or 30 units vial should be dissolved in 5 mL or 10 mL, respectively, of Sodium Chloride for Injection, 0.9%, USP, and administered slowly over a period of 10 minutes.<br></p>

<h2>Intrapleural<br>
</h2>
<p class="First">Sixty units of Bleomycin for Injection are dissolved in 50 to 100 mL Sodium Chloride for Injection, 0.9%, USP, and administered through a thoracostomy tube following drainage of excess pleural fluid and confirmation of complete lung expansion. Â The literature suggests that successful pleurodesis is, in part, dependent upon complete drainage of the pleural fluid and re-establishment of negative intrapleural pressure prior to instillation of a sclerosing agent. Â Therefore, the amount of drainage from the chest tube should be as minimal as possible prior to instillation of Bleomycin for Injection. Â Although there is no conclusive evidence to support this contention, it is generally accepted that chest tube drainage should be less than 100 mL in a 24-hour period prior to sclerosis. Â However, Bleomycin for Injection instillation may be appropriate when drainage is between 100 to 300 mL under clinical conditions that necessitate sclerosis therapy. Â The thoracostomy tube is clamped after Bleomycin for Injection instillation. Â The patient is moved from the supine to the left and right lateral positions several times during the next four hours. Â The clamp is then removed and suction re-established. Â The amount of time the chest tube remains in place following sclerosis is dictated by the clinical situation.</p>
<p>The intrapleural injection of topical anesthetics or systemic narcotic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> is generally not required. </p>
<p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.</p>
