<h2>Mechanism of Action </h2>
<p class="First">The mechanism of action of tacrolimus in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133834" conceptname="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</span> is not known. While the following have been observed, the clinical significance of these observations in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133834" conceptname="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</span> is not known. It has been demonstrated that tacrolimus inhibits T-lymphocyte activation by first binding to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12. A complex of tacrolimus-FKBP-12, calcium, calmodulin, and calcineurin is then formed and the phosphatase activity of calcineurin is inhibited. This effect has been shown to prevent the dephosphorylation and translocation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NF-AT), a nuclear component thought to initiate gene transcription for the formation of lymphokines (such as interleukin-2, gamma interferon). Tacrolimus also inhibits the transcription for genes which encode IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, GM-CSF, and TNF-α, all of which are involved in the early stages of T-cell activation. Additionally, tacrolimus has been shown to inhibit the release of pre-formed mediators from skin mast cells and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4172647" conceptname="Basophil count">basophils</span>, and to down regulate the expression of FcεRI on Langerhans cells. </p>

<h2><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></h2>
<p class="First">The pooled results from three pharmacokinetic studies in 88 adult <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133834" conceptname="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</span> patients indicate that tacrolimus is minimally absorbed after the topical application of tacrolimus ointment. Peak tacrolimus blood concentrations ranged from undetectable to 20 ng/mL after single or multiple doses of 0.03% and 0.1% tacrolimus ointment, with 85% (75/88) of the patients having peak blood concentrations less than 2 ng/mL. In general as treatment continued, systemic exposure declined as the skin returned to normal. In clinical studies with periodic blood sampling, a similar distribution of tacrolimus blood levels was also observed in adult patients, with 90% (1253/1391) of patients having a blood concentration less than 2 ng/mL. The absolute bioavailability of tacrolimus from tacrolimus ointment in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133834" conceptname="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</span> patients is approximately 0.5%. In adults with an average of 53% BSA treated, exposure (AUC) of tacrolimus from tacrolimus ointment is approximately 30-fold less than that seen with oral immunosuppressive doses in kidney and liver transplant patients. Mean peak tacrolimus blood concentrations following oral administration (0.3 mg/kg/day) in adult kidney transplant (n=26) and liver transplant (n=17) patients are 24.2±15.8 ng/mL and 68.5±30.0 ng/mL, respectively. The lowest tacrolimus blood level at which systemic effects (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242843" conceptname="Immunosuppression">immunosuppression</span>) can be observed is not known. Systemic levels of tacrolimus have also been measured in pediatric patients (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><span class="Underline"><a href="#ID_1155359f-ec1a-462e-8d8c-61f2c3abac49">Special Populations: Pediatrics</a></span></span></span>).</p>

<a name="s11"></a><a name="section-4.2"></a><p></p>
<h2><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></h2>
<p class="First">The plasma protein binding of tacrolimus is approximately 99% and is independent of concentration over a range of 5-50 ng/mL. Tacrolimus is bound mainly to albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, and has a high level of association with erythrocytes. The distribution of tacrolimus between whole blood and plasma depends on several factors, such as hematocrit, temperature at the time of plasma separation, drug concentration, and plasma protein concentration. In a US study, the ratio of whole blood concentration to plasma concentration averaged 35 (range 12 to 67). There was no evidence based on blood concentrations that tacrolimus accumulates systemically upon intermittent topical application for periods of up to 1 year. As with other topical calcineurin inhibitors, it is not known whether tacrolimus is distributed into the lymphatic system. </p>

<h2><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></h2>
<p class="First">Tacrolimus is extensively metabolized by the mixed-function oxidase system, primarily the cytochrome P-450 system (CYP3A). A metabolic pathway leading to the formation of 8 possible metabolites has been proposed. Demethylation and hydroxylation were identified as the primary mechanisms of biotransformation <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>. The major metabolite identified in incubations with human liver microsomes is 13-demethyl tacrolimus. In <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies, a 31-demethyl metabolite has been reported to have the same activity as tacrolimus.</p>

<h2><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></h2>
<p class="First">The mean clearance following IV administration of tacrolimus is 0.040, 0.083 and 0.053 L/hr/kg in healthy volunteers, adult kidney transplant patients and adult liver transplant patients, respectively. In man, less than 1% of the dose administered is excreted unchanged in urine. In a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> balance study of IV administered radiolabeled tacrolimus to 6 healthy volunteers, the mean recovery of radiolabel was 77.8 ± 12.7%. Fecal elimination accounted for 92.4 ± 1.0% and the elimination half-life based on radioactivity was 48.1 ± 15.9 hours whereas it was 43.5 ± 11.6 hours based on tacrolimus concentrations. The mean clearance of radiolabel was 0.029 ± 0.015 L/hr/kg and clearance of tacrolimus was 0.029 ± 0.009 L/hr/kg. When administered PO, the mean recovery of the radiolabel was 94.9 ± 30.7%. Fecal elimination accounted for 92.6 ± 30.7%, urinary elimination accounted for 2.3 ± 1.1% and the elimination half-life based on radioactivity was 31.9 ± 10.5 hours whereas it was 48.4 ± 12.3 hours based on tacrolimus concentrations. The mean clearance of radiolabel was 0.226 ± 0.116 L/hr/kg and clearance of tacrolimus 0.172 ± 0.088 L/hr/kg. </p>

<h2><span class="Italics">Special Populations</span></h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Underline">Pediatrics</span></span></p>
<p>In a pharmacokinetic study of 14 pediatric <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133834" conceptname="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</span> patients, between the ages of 2-5 years, peak blood concentrations of tacrolimus ranged from undetectable to 14.8 ng/mL after single or multiple doses of 0.03% tacrolimus ointment, with 86% (12/14) of patients having peak blood concentrations below 2 ng/mL throughout the study. The highest peak concentration was observed in one patient with 82% BSA involvement on day 1 following application of 0.03% tacrolimus ointment. The peak concentrations for this subject were 14.8 ng/mL on day 1 and 4.1 ng/mL on day 14. Mean peak tacrolimus blood concentrations following oral administration in pediatric liver transplant patients (n = 9) were 48.4± 27.9 ng/mL. In a similar pharmacokinetic study with 61 enrolled pediatric patients (ages 6 -12 years) with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133834" conceptname="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</span>, peak tacrolimus blood concentrations ranged from undetectable to 5.3 ng/mL after single or multiple doses of 0.1% tacrolimus ointment, with 91% (52/57) of evaluable patients having peak blood concentrations below 2 ng/mL throughout the study period. When detected, systemic exposure generally declined as treatment continued. In clinical studies with periodic blood sampling, a similar distribution of tacrolimus blood levels was also observed, with 98% (509/522) of pediatric patients having a blood concentration below 2 ng/mL.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES </h1>
<p class="First">Three randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, multi-center, phase 3 studies were conducted to evaluate tacrolimus ointment for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133834" conceptname="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</span>. One (Pediatric) study included 351 patients 2-15 years of age, and the other two (Adult) studies included a total of 632 patients 15-79 years of age. Fifty-five percent (55%) of the patients were women and 27% were black. At baseline, 58% of the patients had severe disease and the mean body surface area (BSA) affected was 46%. Over 80% of patients had <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133834" conceptname="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</span> affecting the face and/or neck region. In these studies, patients applied either tacrolimus ointment 0.03%, tacrolimus ointment 0.1%, or vehicle ointment twice daily to 10% - 100% of their BSA for up to 12 weeks. </p>
<p> In the pediatric study, a significantly greater (p &lt; 0.001) percentage of patients achieved at least 90% improvement based on the physician's global evaluation of clinical response (the pre-defined primary efficacy endpoint) in the tacrolimus ointment 0.03% treatment group compared to the vehicle treatment group, but there was insufficient evidence that tacrolimus ointment 0.1% provided more efficacy than tacrolimus ointment 0.03%.  </p>
<p>In both adult studies, a significantly greater (p &lt; 0.001) percentage of patients achieved at least 90% improvement based on the physician's global evaluation of clinical response in the tacrolimus ointment 0.03% and tacrolimus ointment 0.1% treatment groups compared to the vehicle treatment group. There was evidence that tacrolimus ointment 0.1% may provide more efficacy than tacrolimus ointment 0.03%. The difference in efficacy between tacrolimus ointment 0.1% and 0.03% was particularly evident in adult patients with severe disease at baseline, adults with extensive BSA involvement, and black adults. Response rates for each treatment group are shown below by age groups. Because the two adult studies were identically designed, the results from these studies were pooled in this table. </p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility </h2>
<p class="First">No evidence of genotoxicity was seen in bacterial (<span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span></span> and <span class="Italics">E. coli</span>) or mammalian (Chinese hamster lung-derived cells) <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> assays of mutagenicity, the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> CHO/HGPRT assay of mutagenicity, or <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> clastogenicity assays performed in mice. Tacrolimus did not cause unscheduled DNA synthesis in rodent hepatocytes. Oral (feed) carcinogenicity studies have been carried out with systemically administered tacrolimus in male and female rats and mice. In the 80-week mouse study and in the 104-week rat study no relationship of tumor incidence to tacrolimus dosage was found at daily doses up to 3 mg/kg [9X the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) based on AUC comparisons] and 5 mg/kg (3X the MRHD based on AUC comparisons), respectively. </p>
<p>A 104-week dermal carcinogenicity study was performed in mice with tacrolimus ointment (0.03% - 3%), equivalent to tacrolimus doses of 1.1-118 mg/kg/day or 3.3-354 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day. In the study, the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135777" conceptname="Neoplasm of uncertain behavior of skin">skin tumors</span> was minimal and the topical application of tacrolimus was not associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135777" conceptname="Neoplasm of uncertain behavior of skin">skin tumor</span> formation under ambient room lighting. However, a statistically significant elevation in the incidence of pleomorphic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> in high dose male (25/50) and female animals (27/50) and in the incidence of undifferentiated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> in high dose female animals (13/50) was noted in the mouse dermal carcinogenicity study. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">Lymphomas</span> were noted in the mouse dermal carcinogenicity study at a daily dose of 3.5 mg/kg (0.1% tacrolimus ointment) (26X MRHD based on AUC comparisons). No drug-related tumors were noted in the mouse dermal carcinogenicity study at a daily dose of 1.1 mg/kg (0.03% tacrolimus ointment) (10X MRHD based on AUC comparisons). </p>
<p>In a 52-week photocarcinogenicity study, the median time to onset of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135777" conceptname="Neoplasm of uncertain behavior of skin">skin tumor</span> formation was decreased in hairless mice following chronic topical dosing with concurrent exposure to UV radiation (40 weeks of treatment followed by 12 weeks of observation) with tacrolimus ointment at ≥0.1% tacrolimus. </p>
<p>Reproductive toxicology studies were not performed with topical tacrolimus. In studies of oral tacrolimus no impairment of fertility was seen in male and female rats. Tacrolimus, given orally at 1.0 mg/kg (0.12X MRHD based on body surface area [BSA]) to male and female rats, prior to and during mating, as well as to dams during gestation and lactation, was associated with embryolethality and with adverse effects on female reproduction. Effects on female reproductive function (parturition) and embryolethal effects were indicated by a higher rate of pre-implantation loss and increased numbers of undelivered and nonviable pups. When given at 3.2 mg/kg (0.43X MRHD based on BSA), tacrolimus was associated with maternal and paternal toxicity as well as reproductive toxicity including marked adverse effects on estrus cycles, parturition, pup viability, and pup malformations. </p>

<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of topically administered tacrolimus in pregnant women. The experience with tacrolimus ointment when used by pregnant women is too limited to permit assessment of the safety of its use during pregnancy. Reproduction studies were carried out with systemically administered tacrolimus in rats and rabbits. Adverse effects on the fetus were observed mainly at oral dose levels that were toxic to dams. Tacrolimus at oral doses of 0.32 and 1.0 mg/kg (0.04X-0.12X MRHD based on BSA) during organogenesis in rabbits was associated with maternal toxicity as well as an increase in incidence of abortions. At the higher dose only, an increased incidence of malformations and developmental variations was also seen. Tacrolimus, at oral doses of 3.2 mg/kg during organogenesis in rats, was associated with maternal toxicity and caused an increase in late resorptions, decreased numbers of live births, and decreased pup weight and viability. Tacrolimus, given orally at 1.0 and 3.2 mg/kg (0.04X-0.12X MRHD based on BSA) to pregnant rats after organogenesis and during lactation, was associated with reduced pup weights. No reduction in male or female fertility was evident. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of systemically administered tacrolimus in pregnant women. Tacrolimus is transferred across the placenta. The use of systemically administered tacrolimus during pregnancy has been associated with neonatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span> and renal dysfunction. Tacrolimus ointment should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies a potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<p>The most common adverse events from these studies associated with tacrolimus ointment application in pediatric patients were skin burning and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span> (see                      <span class="Bold"><span class="Underline"><a href="#s42">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span></span>). In addition to skin burning and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span>, the less common events (&lt; 5%) of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443943" conceptname="Herpes zoster">varicella zoster</span> (mostly chicken pox), and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4032934" conceptname="Vesiculobullous rash">vesiculobullous rash</span> were more frequent in patients treated with tacrolimus ointment 0.03% compared to vehicle. In the open-label safety studies, the incidence of adverse events, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span>, did not increase with increased duration of study drug exposure or amount of ointment used. In about 4,400 pediatric patients treated with tacrolimus ointment, 24 (0.5%) were reported with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137792" conceptname="Eczema herpeticum">eczema herpeticum</span>. Since the safety and efficacy of tacrolimus ointment have not been established in pediatric patients below 2 years of age, its use in this age group is not recommended. In an open-label study, immune response to a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine was assessed in 23 children 2 to 12 years old with moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133834" conceptname="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</span> treated with tacrolimus ointment 0.03%. Protective antibody titers developed in all patients. Similarly, in a seven-month, double-blind trial, the vaccination response to meningococcal serogroup C was equivalent in children 2 to 11 years old with moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133834" conceptname="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</span> treated with tacrolimus ointment 0.03% (n=121), a hydrocortisone ointment regimen (n=111), or normal children (n=44). </p>

<p><span class="Bold">What is </span><span class="Bold">tacrolimus</span><span class="Bold"> ointment?</span></p>
<p>Tacrolimus ointment is a prescription medicine used on the skin (topical) to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133835" conceptname="Eczema">eczema</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133834" conceptname="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</span>).
