<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Estazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine derivative, is an oral hypnotic agent. Estazolam occurs as a fine, white, odorless powder that is soluble in alcohol and practically insoluble in water. The chemical name for estazolam is 8-chloro-6-phenyl-4<span class="Italics">H</span>-s-triazolo[4,3-Î±][1,4]benzodiazepine. The structural formula is represented as follows:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="Image of Structural Formula" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=50914a46-eab6-4c83-97cf-6ab0234c8126&amp;name=5b6b788b-42ed-477c-8aa5-428a95eb22c4-01.jpg"></div>

<h3>Absorption</h3>
<p class="First">Estazolam tablets have been found to be equivalent in absorption to an orally administered solution of estazolam. In healthy subjects who received up to three times the recommended dose of estazolam, peak estazolam plasma concentrations occurred within two hours after dosing (range 0.5 to 6.0 hours) and were proportional to the administered dose, suggesting linear pharmacokinetics over the dosage range tested.</p>

<h3>Distribution</h3>
<p class="First">Independent of concentration, estazolam in plasma is 93% protein bound. </p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="i4i_section_id_d67006de-b1e6-466d-9e78-fcffd6b0438b"></a><a name="section-2.1.3"></a><p></p>
<h3>Metabolism</h3>
<p class="First">Estazolam is extensively metabolized. Only two metabolites (1-oxo-estazolam &amp; 4-hydroxy-estazolam) were detected in human plasma up to 18 hrs. </p>
<p>The pharmacologic activity of estazolam is primarily from the parent drug. The elimination of the parent drug takes place via hepatic metabolism of estazolam to hydroxylated and other metabolites that are eliminated largely in the urine both free and conjugated. In humans, greater than 70% of a single dose of estazolam was recovered in the urine as metabolites. Less than 5% of a 2 mg dose of estazolam was excreted unchanged in the urine, with only 4% of the dose appearing in the feces. The principal urinary excretion product is an unidentified metabolite, presumed to be a metabolic product of 4-hydroxy-estazolam, accounting for at least 27% of the administered dose. 4-hydroxy-estazolam is the major metabolite in plasma, with concentrations approaching 12% of those of the parent eight hours after administration. Urinary 4-hydroxy-estazolam and 1-oxo-estazolam account for 11.9% and 4.4% of the dose respectively. <span class="Italics">In vitro </span>studies with human liver microsomes indicate that the biotransformation of estazolam to the major circulating metabolite 4-hydroxy-estazolam is mediated by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). While 4-hydroxy-estazolam and the lesser metabolite, 1-oxo-estazolam, have some pharmacologic activity, their low potencies and low concentrations preclude any significant contribution to the hypnotic effect of estazolam. </p>

<h3>Elimination</h3>
<p class="First">The range of estimates for the mean elimination half-life of estazolam varied from 10 to 24 hours. Radiolabel <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> balance studies indicate that the main route of excretion is via the kidneys. After 5 days, 87% of the administered radioactivity was excreted in human urine. Less than 4% of the dose was excreted unchanged. Eleven metabolites were found in urine. Four metabolites were identified as 1-oxo-estazolam, 4â€™-hydroxy-estazolam, 4-hydroxy-estazolam, and benzophenone, as free metabolites and glucuronides. The predominant metabolite in urine (17% of the administered dose) has not been identified, but is likely to be a metabolite of 4-hydroxy-estazolam. </p>

<h3>Special Populations</h3>
<p class="First">In a small study (N = 8) using various doses in older subjects (59 to 68 years), peak estazolam concentrations were found to be similar to those observed in younger subjects with a mean elimination half-life of 18.4 hours (range 13.5 to 34.6 hours). The influence of hepatic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> on the pharmacokinetics of estazolam has not been studied. </p>

<h4>Cigarette smoking</h4>
<p class="First">The clearance of benzodiazepines is accelerated in smokers compared to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4222303" conceptname="Non-smoker">nonsmokers</span>, and there is evidence that this occurs with estazolam. This decrease in half-life, presumably due to enzyme induction by smoking, is consistent with other drugs with similar hepatic clearance characteristics. In all subjects and at all doses, the mean elimination half-life appeared to be independent of the dose. </p>

<h4>Drug-drug interaction</h4>
<p class="First">The metabolism of estazolam to the major circulating metabolite 4-hydroxy-estazolam is catalyzed by CYP3A. While no <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> drug-drug interaction studies were conducted between estazolam and inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A, compounds that are potent CYP3A inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, fluvoxamine, and erythromycin) would be expected to increase plasma estazolam concentrations and CYP3A inducers (such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin and barbiturates) would be expected to decrease estazolam concentrations. </p>

<h4>Drug interaction with fluoxetine</h4>
<p class="First">A multiple-dose study was conducted to assess the effect of fluoxetine 20 mg BID on the pharmacokinetics of estazolam 2 mg QHS after seven days. The pharmacokinetics of estazolam (C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC) were not affected during multiple-dose fluoxetine, suggesting no clinically significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interaction</span>. </p>

<h4>The ability of estazolam to induce or inhibit human enzyme systems</h4>
<p class="First">The results from <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> human liver microsomal studies suggest that at therapeutic concentrations, estazolam has no significant inhibitory effect on the major human cytochrome P450 enzyme activities (i.e., CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A). The ability of estazolam to induce human hepatic enzyme systems has not been determined. </p>

<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Postulated relationship between elimination rate of benzodiazepine hypnotics and their profile of common untoward effects:</span> The type and duration of hypnotic effects and the profile of unwanted effects during administration of benzodiazepine drugs may be influenced by the biologic half-life of administered drug and any active metabolites formed. If half-lives are long, drug or metabolites may accumulate during periods of nightly administration and may be associated with impairments of cognitive and/or motor performance during waking hours; the possibility of interaction with other psychoactive drugs or alcohol will be increased. In contrast, if half-lives are short, drug and metabolites will be cleared before the next dose is ingested, and carry-over effects related to excessive sedation or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span> should be minimal or absent. However, during nightly use for an extended period, pharmacodynamic tolerance or adaptation to some effects of benzodiazepine hypnotics may develop. If the drug has a short elimination half-life, it is possible that a relative deficiency of the drug or its active metabolites (i.e., in relationship to the receptor site) may occur at some point in the interval between each nightâ€™s use. This sequence of events may account for two clinical findings reported to occur after several weeks of nightly use of rapidly eliminated benzodiazepine hypnotics, namely, increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4100068" conceptname="Wakefulness">wakefulness</span> during the last third of the night and increased daytime <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> in selected patients. </p>

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Controlled Trials Supporting Efficacy:</span> In three 7 night, double-blind, parallel-group trials comparing estazolam 1 mg and/or 2 mg with placebo in adult outpatients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">chronic insomnia</span>, estazolam 2 mg was consistently superior to placebo in subjective measures of sleep induction (latency) and sleep maintenance (duration, number of awakenings, depth and quality of sleep); estazolam 1 mg was similarly superior to placebo on all measures of sleep maintenance, however, it significantly improved sleep induction in only one of two studies. In a similarly designed trial comparing estazolam 0.5 mg and 1 mg with placebo in geriatric outpatients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">chronic insomnia</span>, only the 1 mg estazolam dose was consistently superior to placebo in sleep induction (latency) and in only one measure of sleep maintenance (i.e., duration of sleep).</p>
<p>In a single-night, double-blind, parallel-group trial comparing estazolam 2 mg and placebo in patients admitted for elective surgery and requiring sleep medications, estazolam was superior to placebo in subjective measures of sleep induction and maintenance.</p>
<p>In a 12 week, double-blind, parallel-group trial including a comparison of estazolam 2 mg and placebo in adult outpatients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">chronic insomnia</span>, estazolam was superior to placebo in subjective measures of sleep induction (latency) and maintenance (duration, number of awakenings, total wake time during sleep) at week 2, but produced consistent improvement over 12 weeks only for sleep duration and total wake time during sleep. Following withdrawal at week 12, rebound <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> was seen at the first withdrawal week, but there was no difference between drug and placebo by the second withdrawal week in all parameters except latency, for which normalization did not occur until the fourth withdrawal week.</p>
<p>Adult outpatients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">chronic insomnia</span> were evaluated in a sleep laboratory trial comparing four doses of estazolam (0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg) and placebo, each administered for 2 nights in a crossover design. The higher estazolam doses were superior to placebo in most EEG measures of sleep induction and maintenance, especially at the 2 mg dose, but only for sleep duration in subjective measures of sleep. </p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Estazolam is indicated for the short-term management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> characterized by difficulty in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falling</span> asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings, and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4283230" conceptname="Terminal insomnia">early morning awakenings</span>. Both outpatient studies and a sleep laboratory study have shown that estazolam administered at bedtime improved sleep induction and sleep maintenance (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>).</p>
<p>Because <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> is often transient and intermittent, the prolonged administration of estazolam is generally neither necessary nor recommended. Since <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> may be a symptom of several other disorders, the possibility that the complaint may be related to a condition for which there is a more specific treatment should be considered.</p>
<p>There is evidence to support the ability of estazolam to enhance the duration and quality of sleep for intervals up to 12 weeks (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>).</p>

<h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Benzodiazepines may cause fetal damage when administered during pregnancy. An increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of diazepam and chlordiazepoxide during the first trimester of pregnancy has been suggested in several studies. Transplacental distribution has resulted in neonatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span> and also withdrawal phenomena following the ingestion of therapeutic doses of a benzodiazepine hypnotic during the last weeks of pregnancy.</p>
<p>Estazolam is contraindicated in pregnant women. If there is a likelihood of the patient becoming pregnant while receiving estazolam she should be warned of the potential risk to the fetus and instructed to discontinue the drug prior to becoming pregnant. The possibility that a woman of childbearing potential is pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered.</p>
<p>Estazolam is contraindicated with ketoconazole and itraconazole, since these medications significantly impair oxidative metabolism mediated by CYP3A (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS </span>and <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>, <span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span>). </p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First">Because <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435524" conceptname="Sleep disorder">sleep disturbances</span> may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and/or psychiatric disorder, symptomatic treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> should be initiated only after a careful evaluation of the patient. <span class="Bold">The failure of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the </span><span class="Bold">presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated</span><span class="Bold">.</span> Worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> or the emergence of new thinking or behavior abnormalities may be the consequence of an unrecognized psychiatric or physical disorder. Such findings have emerged during the course of treatment with sedative-hypnotic drugs. Because some of the important adverse effects of sedative-hypnotics appear to be dose-related (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span> and <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>), it is important to use the smallest possible effective dose, especially in the elderly. </p>
<p>Complex behaviors such as â€œsleep-drivingâ€? (i.e., driving while not fully awake after ingestion of a sedative-hypnotic, with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439147" conceptname="Amnesia">amnesia</span> for the event) have been reported. These events can occur in sedative-hypnotic-naÃ¯ve as well as in sedative-hypnotic-experienced persons. Although behaviors such as sleep-driving may occur with sedative-hypnotics alone at therapeutic doses, the use of alcohol and other CNS depressants with sedative-hypnotics appears to increase the risk of such behaviors, as does the use of sedative-hypnotics at doses exceeding the maximum recommended dose. Due to the risk to the patient and the community, discontinuation of sedative-hypnotics should be strongly considered for patients who report a â€œsleep-drivingâ€? episode.</p>
<p>Other complex behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have been reported in patients who are not fully awake after taking a sedative-hypnotic. As with sleep-driving, patients usually do not remember these events.</p>

If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432791" conceptname="Angioedema">angioedema</span> involves the tongue, glottis or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Patients who develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432791" conceptname="Angioedema">angioedema</span> after treatment with estazolam should not be rechallenged with the drug. </p>
<p>Estazolam, like other benzodiazepines, has CNS depressant effects. For this reason, patients should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, after ingesting the drug, including potential impairment of the performance of such activities that may occur the day following ingestion of estazolam. Patients should also be cautioned about possible combined effects with alcohol and other CNS depressant drugs.</p>

<h2>Estazolam Interaction With Drugs That Inhibit Metabolism via Cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A)</h2>
<p class="First">The metabolism of estazolam to the major circulating metabolite 4-hydroxy-estazolam and the metabolism of other triazolobenzodiazepines is catalyzed by CYP3A. Consequently, estazolam should be avoided in patients receiving ketoconazole and itraconazole, which are very potent inhibitors of CYP3A (see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>). With drugs inhibiting CYP3A to a lesser, but still significant degree, estazolam should be used only with caution and consideration of appropriate dosage reduction. The following are examples of drugs known to inhibit the metabolism of other related benzodiazepines, presumably through inhibition of CYP3A: nefazodone, fluvoxamine, cimetidine, diltiazem, isoniazide, and some macrolide antibiotics. </p>
<p>While no <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> drug-drug interaction studies were conducted between estazolam and inducers of CYP3A, compounds that are potent CYP3A inducers (such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, and barbiturates) would be expected to decrease estazolam concentrations. </p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Impaired motor and/or cognitive performance attributable to the accumulation of benzodiazepines and their active metabolites following several days of repeated use at their recommended doses is a concern in certain vulnerable patients (e.g., those especially sensitive to the effects of benzodiazepines or those with a reduced capacity to metabolize and eliminate them) (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p>
<p>Elderly or debilitated patients and those with impaired renal or hepatic function should be cautioned about these risks and advised to monitor themselves for signs of excessive sedation or impaired conditions.</p>
<p>Estazolam appears to cause dose-related <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> that is ordinarily not clinically relevant at recommended doses in patients with normal respiratory function. However, patients with compromised respiratory function may be at risk and should be monitored appropriately. As a class, benzodiazepines have the capacity to depress respiratory drive; there are insufficient data available, however, to characterize their relative potency in depressing respiratory drive at clinically recommended doses.</p>
<p>As with other benzodiazepines, estazolam should be administered with caution to patients exhibiting signs or symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>. Suicidal tendencies may be present in such patients and protective measures may be required. Intentional overdosage is more common in this group of patients; therefore, the least amount of drug that is feasible should be prescribed for the patient at any one time.</p>

<a name="i4i_section_id_4f034b48-b8b9-4c23-9682-b22d83b0643d"></a><a name="section-7.2.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>â€œSleep-Drivingâ€? and Other Complex Behaviors</h3>
<p class="First">There have been reports of people getting out of bed after taking a sedative-hypnotic and driving their cars while not fully awake, often with no memory of the event. If a patient experiences such an episode, it should be reported to his or her doctor immediately, since â€œsleep-drivingâ€? can be dangerous. This behavior is more likely to occur when sedative-hypnotics are taken with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>). Other complex behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have been reported in patients who are not fully awake after taking a sedative-hypnotic. As with sleep-driving, patients usually do not remember these events.</p>
<p>To assure the safe and effective use of estazolam, the following information and instructions should be given to patients:</p>
<ol>
<li>Inform your physician about any alcohol consumption and medicine you are taking now, including drugs you may buy without a prescription. Alcohol should not be used during treatment with hypnotics.</li>
<li>Inform your physician if you are planning to become pregnant, if you are pregnant, or if you become pregnant while you are taking this medicine.</li>
<li>You should not take this medicine if you are nursing, as the drug may be excreted in breast milk.</li>
<li>Until you experience the way this medicine affects you, do not drive a car, operate potentially dangerous machinery, or engage in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness after taking this medicine.</li>
<li>Since benzodiazepines may produce psychological and physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>, you should not increase the dose before consulting your physician. In addition, since the abrupt discontinuation of estazolam may be associated with temporary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435524" conceptname="Sleep disorder">sleep disturbances</span>, you should consult your physician before abruptly discontinuing doses of 2 mg per night or more.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">Laboratory tests are not ordinarily required in otherwise healthy patients. When treatment with estazolam is protracted, periodic blood counts, urinalyses, and blood chemistry analyses are advisable.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">If estazolam is given concomitantly with other drugs acting on the central nervous system, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of all agents. The action of the benzodiazepines may be potentiated by anticonvulsants, antihistamines, alcohol, barbiturates, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, narcotics, phenothiazines, psychotropic medications, or other drugs that produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span>. Smokers have an increased clearance of benzodiazepines as compared to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4222303" conceptname="Non-smoker">nonsmokers</span>; this was seen in studies with estazolam (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL </span><span class="Bold">PHARMACOLOGY</span>).</p>
<p>While no <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> drug-drug interaction studies were conducted between estazolam and inducers of CYP3A, compounds that are potent CYP3A inhibitors (such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, and barbiturates) would be expected to decrease estazolam concentrations. </p>

<h3>Estazolam Interaction With Drugs That Inhibit Metabolism via Cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A)</h3>
<p class="First">The metabolism of estazolam to the major circulating metabolite 4-hydroxy-estazolam and the metabolism of other triazolobenzodiazepines is catalyzed by CYP3A. Consequently, estazolam should be avoided in patients receiving ketoconazole and itraconazole, which are very potent inhibitors of CYP3A (see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>). With drugs inhibiting CYP3A to a lesser, but still significant degree, estazolam should be used only with caution and consideration of appropriate dosage reduction. The following are examples of drugs known to inhibit the metabolism of other related benzodiazepines, presumably through inhibition of CYP3A: nefazodone, fluvoxamine, cimetidine, diltiazem, isoniazide, and some macrolide antibiotics. </p>

<h4>Drug interaction with fluoxetine</h4>
<p class="First">A multiple-dose study was conducted to assess the effect of fluoxetine 20 mg BID on the pharmacokinetics of estazolam 2 mg QHS after seven days. The pharmacokinetics of estazolam (C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC) were not affected during multiple-dose fluoxetine, suggesting no clinically significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interaction</span>. </p>

<h3>Estazolam Interaction With Other Drugs That are Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP)</h3>
<p class="First">At clinically relevant concentrations, <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies indicate that estazolam (0.6ÂµM) was not inhibitory towards the major cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A. Therefore, based on these <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> data, estazolam is very unlikely to inhibit the biotransformation of other drugs metabolized by these CYP isoforms. </p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats at dietary doses of 0.8, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day and 0.5, 2, and 10 mg/kg/day, respectively. Evidence of tumorigenicity was not observed in either study. Incidence of hyperplastic liver <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4101098" conceptname="Nodule">nodules</span> increased in female mice given the mid- and high-dose levels. The significance of such <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4101098" conceptname="Nodule">nodules</span> in mice is not known at this time.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vitro </span>and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mutagenicity tests including the Ames test, DNA repair in <span class="Italics">B. subtilis, in vivo</span> cytogenetics in mice and rats, and the dominant lethal test in mice did not show a mutagenic potential for estazolam.</p>
<p>Fertility in male and female rats was not affected by doses up to 30 times the usual recommended human dose.</p>

<h2>Associated With Discontinuation of Treatment</h2>
<p class="First">Approximately 3% of 1277 patients who received estazolam in U.S. premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse clinical event.

<h2>Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials</h2>
<p class="First">The table below enumerates adverse events that occurred at an incidence of 1% or greater among patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> who received estazolam in 7 night, placebo-controlled trials. Events reported by investigators were classified into standard dictionary (COSTART) terms to establish event frequencies. Event frequencies reported were not corrected for the occurrence of these events at baseline. The frequencies were obtained from data pooled across six studies: estazolam, N = 685; placebo, N = 433. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice in which patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in these six clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigators involving related drug products and uses, since each group of drug trials was conducted under a different set of conditions. However, the cited figures provide the physician with a basis of estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the incidence of side effects in the population studied.</p>

<h2>Other Adverse Events</h2>
<p class="First">During clinical trials, some of which were not placebo-controlled, estazolam was administered to approximately 1300 patients. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events, similar types of untoward events must be grouped into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tabulations that follow, a standard COSTART dictionary terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 1277 individuals exposed to estazolam who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving estazolam. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those COSTART terms too general to be informative, and those events where a drug cause was remote. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in less than 1/1000 patients. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported did occur during treatment with estazolam, they were not necessarily caused by it.</p>

<h2>Abuse and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">Dependence</span></h2>
<p class="First">Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> and tolerance. Abuse is characterized by misuse of the drug for non-medical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> is a state of adaptation that is manifested by a specific withdrawal syndrome that can be produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, decreasing blood level of the drug and/or administration of an antagonist. Tolerance is a state of adaptation in which exposure to a drug induces changes that result in a dimunition of one or more of the drugâ€™s effects over time. Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs and may develop at different rates for different effects. </p>
<p>Addiction is a primary, chronic, neurobiological disease with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations. It is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following: impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug addiction</span> is a treatable disease, utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common.</p>
<p>Withdrawal symptoms similar to those noted with sedatives/hypnotics and alcohol have occurred following the abrupt discontinuation of drugs in the benzodiazepine class. The symptoms can range from mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4148767" conceptname="Dysphoric mood">dysphoria</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> to a major syndrome that may include abdominal and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75635" conceptname="Cramp">muscle cramps</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremors</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>.</p>
<p>Although withdrawal symptoms are more commonly noted after the discontinuation of higher than therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines, a proportion of patients taking benzodiazepines chronically at therapeutic doses may become physically dependent on them. Available data, however, cannot provide a reliable estimate of the incidence of dependency or the relationship of the dependency to dose and duration of treatment. There is some evidence to suggest that gradual reduction of dosage will attenuate or eliminate some withdrawal phenomena. In most instances, withdrawal phenomena are relatively mild and transient; however, life-threatening events (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373995" conceptname="Delirium">delirium</span>, etc.) have been reported.</p>
<p>Gradual withdrawal is the preferred course for any patient taking benzodiazepines for a prolonged period. Patients with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>, regardless of their concomitant antiseizure drug therapy, should not be withdrawn abruptly from benzodiazepines.</p>
<p>Individuals with a history of addiction to or abuse of drugs or alcohol should be under careful surveillance when receiving benzodiazepines because of the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4036424" conceptname="Drug tolerance">habituation</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> to such patients.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">As with other benzodiazepines, experience with estazolam indicates that manifestations of overdosage include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, impaired coordination, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196636" conceptname="Dysarthria">slurred speech</span>, and ultimately, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>.

As in the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4244894" conceptname="Intentional drug overdose">intentional overdose</span> with any drug, the possibility should be considered that multiple agents may have been taken.</p>
<p>Gastric evacuation, either by the induction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span>, lavage, or both, should be performed immediately. Maintenance of adequate ventilation is essential. General supportive care, including frequent monitoring of the vital signs and close observation of the patient, is indicated. Fluids should be administered intravenously to maintain blood pressure and encourage <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span>. The value of dialysis in treatment of benzodiazepine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> has not been determined. The physician may wish to consider contacting a Poison Control Center for up-to-date information on the management of hypnotic drug product <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>.</p>
<p>Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, is indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines and may be used in situations when an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> with a benzodiazepine is known or suspected. Prior to the administration of flumazenil, necessary measures should be instituted to secure airway, ventilation, and intravenous access. Flumazenil is intended as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, proper management of benzodiazepine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. Patients treated with flumazenil should be monitored for resedation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, and other residual benzodiazepine effects for an appropriate period after treatment. <span class="Bold">The prescriber should be aware of a risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> in association with flumazenil treatment, particularly in long-term benzodiazepine users and in cyclic antidepressant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>.</span> The complete flumazenil package insert including CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS should be consulted prior to use.</p>
