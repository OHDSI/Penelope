<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></p>
<p>Metoprolol tartrate is a beta<span class="Sub">1</span>-selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocker. This preferential effect is not absolute, however, and at higher plasma concentrations, metoprolol also inhibits beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenoreceptors, chiefly located in the bronchial and vascular musculature.</p>
<p>Clinical pharmacology studies have demonstrated the beta-blocking activity of metoprolol, as shown by (1) reduction in heart rate and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span> at rest and upon exercise, (2) reduction of systolic blood pressure upon exercise, (3) inhibition of isoproterenol-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, and (4) reduction of reflex orthostatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">Hypertension</span></span></p>
<p>The mechanism of the antihypertensive effects of beta-blocking agents has not been fully elucidated. However, several possible mechanisms have been proposed:  (1) competitive antagonism of catecholamines at peripheral (especially cardiac) adrenergic neuron sites, leading to decreased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span>; (2) a central effect leading to reduced sympathetic outflow to the periphery; and (3) suppression of renin activity.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321318" conceptname="Angina pectoris">Angina Pectoris</span></span></p>
<p>By blocking catecholamine-induced increases in heart rate, in velocity and extent of myocardial contraction, and in blood pressure, metoprolol tartrate reduces the oxygen requirements of the heart at any given level of effort, thus making it useful in the long-term management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321318" conceptname="Angina pectoris">angina pectoris</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">Myocardial Infarction</span></span></p>
<p>The precise mechanism of action of metoprolol tartrate in patients with suspected or definite <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> is not known.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pharmacodynamics</span></p>
<p>Relative beta<span class="Sub">1</span> selectivity is demonstrated by the following: (1) In healthy subjects, metoprolol is unable to reverse the beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-mediated vasodilating effects of epinephrine. This contrasts with the effect of nonselective (beta<span class="Sub">1</span> plus beta<span class="Sub">2</span>) beta-blockers, which completely reverse the vasodilating effects of epinephrine. (2) In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatic</span> patients, metoprolol reduces FEV<span class="Sub">1</span> and FVC significantly less than a nonselective beta blocker, propranolol, at equivalent beta<span class="Sub">1</span>-receptor blocking doses.</p>
<p>Metoprolol has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and membrane-stabilizing activity is detectable only at doses much greater than required for beta blockade. Animal and human experiments indicate that metoprolol slows the sinus rate and decreases AV nodal conduction.</p>
<dl>
<dt>•</dt>
<dd>When the drug was infused over a 10-minute period, in normal volunteers, maximum beta blockade was achieved at approximately 20 minutes. Equivalent maximal beta blocking effect is achieved with oral and intravenous doses in the ratio of approximately 2.5:1. There is a linear relationship between the log of plasma levels and reduction of exercise heart rate.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In several studies of patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">acute myocardial infarction</span>, intravenous followed by oral administration of metoprolol tartrate caused a reduction in heart rate, systolic blood pressure and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4231869" conceptname="Stroke volume">Stroke volume</span>, diastolic blood pressure and pulmonary artery end diastolic pressure remained unchanged.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p>
<p>The estimated oral bioavailability of immediate release metopropol is about 50% because of pre-systemic metabolism which is saturable leading to non-proportionate increase in the exposure with increased dose.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p>
<p>Metoprolol is extensively distributed with a reported volume of distribution of 3.2 to 5.6 L/kg. About 10% of metoprolol in plasma is bound to serum albumin. Metoprolol is known to cross the placenta and is found in breast milk. Metoprolol is also known to cross the blood brain barrier following oral administration and CSF concentrations close to that observed in plasma have been reported. Metoprolol is not a significant P-glycoprotein substrate.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p>
<p>Metoprolol tartrate is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. Metoprolol tartrate is a racemic mixture of R- and S-enantiomers, and when administered orally, it exhibits stereo selective metabolism that is dependent on oxidation phenotype. CYP2D6 is absent (poor metabolizers) in about 8% of Caucasians and about 2% of most other populations. Poor CYP2D6 metabolizers exhibit several-fold higher plasma concentrations of metoprolol than extensive metabolizers with normal CYP2D6 activity thereby decreasing metoprolol tartrate’s cardioselectivity. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p>
<p>Elimination of metoprolol tartrate is mainly by biotransformation in the liver. The mean elimination half-life of metoprolol is 3 to 4 hours; in poor CYP2D6 metabolizers the half-life may be 7 to 9 hours. Approximately 95% of the dose can be recovered in urine. In most subjects (extensive metabolizers), less than 10% of an intravenous dose are excreted as unchanged drug in the urine. In poor metabolizers, up to 30% or 40% of oral or intravenous doses, respectively, may be excreted unchanged; the rest is excreted by the kidneys as metabolites that appear to have no beta blocking activity. The renal clearance of the stereo-isomers does not exhibit stereo-selectivity in renal excretion.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Special populations</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Geriatric Patients</span></p>
<p>The geriatric population may show slightly higher plasma concentrations of metoprolol as a combined result of a decreased metabolism of the drug in elderly population and a decreased hepatic blood flow. However, this increase is not clinically significant or therapeutically relevant.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal impairment</span></span></p>
<p>The systemic availability and half-life of metoprolol tartrate in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> do not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in normal subjects. Consequently, no reduction in dosage is usually needed in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198185" conceptname="Chronic renal failure">chronic renal failure</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic Impairment</span></span></p>
<p>Since the drug is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> may impact the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol. The elimination half-life of metoprolol is considerably prolonged, depending on severity (up to 7.2 h).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Clinical Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">Hypertension</span></span></p>
<p>In controlled clinical studies, metoprolol tartrate has been shown to be an effective antihypertensive agent when used alone or as concomitant therapy with thiazide-type diuretics, at oral dosages of 100-450 mg daily. In controlled, comparative, clinical studies, metoprolol tartrate has been shown to be as effective an antihypertensive agent as propranolol, methyldopa, and thiazide-type diuretics, to be equally effective in supine and standing positions.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321318" conceptname="Angina pectoris">Angina Pectoris</span></span></p>
<p>In controlled clinical trials, metoprolol tartrate, administered orally two or four times daily, has been shown to be an effective antianginal agent, reducing the number of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321318" conceptname="Angina pectoris">angina attacks</span> and increasing exercise tolerance. The oral dosage used in these studies ranged from 100-400 mg daily. A controlled, comparative, clinical trial showed that metoprolol tartrate was indistinguishable from propranolol in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321318" conceptname="Angina pectoris">angina pectoris</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">Myocardial Infarction</span></span></p>
<p>In a large (1,395 patients randomized), double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study, metoprolol was shown to reduce 3-month mortality by 36% in patients with suspected or definite <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>.</p>
<p>Patients were randomized and treated as soon as possible after their arrival in the hospital, once their clinical condition had stabilized and their hemodynamic status had been carefully evaluated. Subjects were ineligible if they had <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>, peripheral signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span>, and/or more than minimal basal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4167669" conceptname="Respiratory crackles">rales</span> as signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>. Initial treatment consisted of intravenous followed by oral administration of metoprolol tartrate or placebo, given in a coronary care or comparable unit. Oral maintenance therapy with metoprolol or placebo was then continued for 3 months. After this double-blind period, all patients were given metoprolol and followed up to 1 year.</p>
<p>The median delay from the onset of symptoms to the initiation of therapy was 8 hours in both the metoprolol- and placebo-treatment groups. Among patients treated with metoprolol, there were comparable reductions in 3-month mortality for those treated early (≤8 hours) and those in whom treatment was started later. Significant reductions in the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437894" conceptname="Ventricular fibrillation">ventricular fibrillation</span> and in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77670" conceptname="Chest pain">chest pain</span> following initial intravenous therapy were also observed with metoprolol and were independent of the interval between onset of symptoms and initiation of therapy.</p>
<p>In this study, patients treated with metoprolol received the drug both very early (intravenously) and during a subsequent 3-month period, while placebo patients received no beta-blocker treatment for this period. The study thus was able to show a benefit from the overall metoprolol regimen but cannot separate the benefit of very early intravenous treatment from the benefit of later beta-blocker therapy. Nonetheless, because the overall regimen showed a clear beneficial effect on survival without evidence of an early adverse effect on survival, one acceptable dosage regimen is the precise regimen used in the trial. Because the specific benefit of very early treatment remains to be defined however, it is also reasonable to administer the drug orally to patients at a later time as is recommended for certain other beta blockers.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">Heart Failure</span></span></p>
<p>Beta blockers, like metoprolol tartrate, can cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> of myocardial contractility and may precipitate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198571" conceptname="Cardiogenic shock">cardiogenic shock</span>. If signs or symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> develop, treat the patient according to recommended guidelines. It may be necessary to lower the dose of  metoprolol tartrate or to discontinue it. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4124683" conceptname="Silent myocardial ischemia">Ischemic Heart Disease</span></span></p>
<p>Do not abruptly discontinue metoprolol tartrate therapy in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317576" conceptname="Coronary arteriosclerosis">coronary artery disease</span>. Severe exacerbation of angina,  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span> have been reported in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317576" conceptname="Coronary arteriosclerosis">coronary artery disease</span> following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with beta-blockers. When discontinuing chronically administered metoprolol tartrate, particularly in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317576" conceptname="Coronary arteriosclerosis">coronary artery disease</span>, the dosage should be gradually reduced over a period of 1 to 2 weeks and the patient should be carefully monitored. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, metoprolol tartrate administration should be reinstated promptly, at least temporarily, and other measures appropriate for the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315296" conceptname="Preinfarction syndrome">unstable angina</span> should be taken. Patients should be warned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician’s advice.  Because <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317576" conceptname="Coronary arteriosclerosis">coronary artery disease</span> is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to discontinue metoprolol tartrate therapy abruptly even in patients treated only for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Use During Major Surgery</span></p>
<p>Chronically administered beta-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery; however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">Exacerbation of Bronchospastic Disease</span></p>
<p>Patients with bronchospastic disease, should, in general, not receive beta blockers, including metoprolol tartrate. Because of its relative beta<span class="Sub">1</span> selectivity, however, metoprolol tartrate may be used in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other antihypertensive treatment. Because beta<span class="Sub">1</span> selectivity is not absolute use the lowest possible dose of metoprolol tartrate and consider administering metoprolol tartrate in smaller doses three times daily, instead of larger doses two times daily, to avoid the higher plasma levels associated with the longer dosing interval (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#a11911a9-ea54-4ca2-8289-8ec8b4150932">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).

Observe patients treated with metoprolol plus a catecholamine depletor for evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> or marked <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>, which may produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439383" conceptname="Vertigo">vertigo</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">syncope</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span>. In addition, possibly significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> may theoretically occur up to 14 days following discontinuation of the concomitant administration with an irreversible MAO inhibitor.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Digitalis glycosides and beta blockers: </span>Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>. Monitor heart rate and PR interval.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Calcium channel blockers: </span>Concomitant administration of a beta-adrenergic antagonist with a calcium channel blocker may produce an additive reduction in myocardial contractility because of negative chronotropic and inotropic effects. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">General Anesthetics:</span></p>
<p>Some inhalation anesthetics may enhance the cardiodepressant effect of beta-blockers (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#fb3fdc77-f18a-47a3-a2d1-0addfd21f60c">WARNINGS, Major Surgery</a></span>).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">CYP2D6 Inhibitors: </span></p>
<p>Potent inhibitors of the CYP2D6 enzyme may increase the plasma concentration of metoprolol which would mimic the pharmacokinetics of CYP2D6 poor metabolizer (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#fa863f9f-c5eb-4f28-a2b6-bf93ee38ebcd">Pharmacokinetics</a></span> section). Increase in plasma concentrations of metoprolol would decrease the cardioselectivity of metoprolol. Known clinically significant potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 are antidepressants such as fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, bupropion, clomipramine, and desipramine; antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, haloperidol, and thioridazine; antiarrhythmics such as quinidine or propafenone; antiretrovirals such as ritonavir; antihistamines such as diphenhydramine; antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine or quinidine; antifungals such as terbinafine.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Hydralazine: </span>Concomitant administration of hydralazine may inhibit presystemic metabolism of metoprolol leading to increased concentrations of metoprolol.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Alpha-adrenergic agents: </span>Antihypertensive effect of alpha-adrenergic blockers such as guanethidine, betanidine, reserpine, alpha-methyldopa or clonidine may be potentiated by beta-blockers including methoprolol tartrate. Beta-adrenergic blockers may also potentiate the postural hypotensive effect of the first dose of prazosin, probably by preventing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="444070" conceptname="Tachycardia">reflex tachycardia</span>. On the contrary, beta adrenergic blockers may also potentiate the hypertensive response to withdrawal of clonidine in patients receiving concomitant clonidine and beta-adrenergic blocker. </p>
<p>If a patient is treated with clonidine and metoprolol concurrently, and clonidine treatment is to be discontinued, stop metoprolol several days before clonidine is withdrawn. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221991" conceptname="Rebound hypertension">Rebound hypertension</span> that can follow withdrawal of clonidine may be increased in patients receiving concurrent beta-blocker treatment. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Ergot alkaloid: </span>Concomitant administration with beta-blockers may enhance the vasoconstrictive action of ergot alkaloids.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Dipyridamole: </span>In general, administration of a beta-blocker should be withheld before dipyridamole testing, with careful monitoring of heart rate following the dipyridamole injection.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</span></p>
<p>Long-term studies in animals have been conducted to evaluate carcinogenic potential. In a 2-year study in rats at three oral dosage levels of up to 800 mg/kg per day, there was no increase in the development of spontaneously occurring benign or malignant neoplasms of any type. The only histologic changes that appeared to be drug related were an increased incidence of generally mild focal accumulation of foamy macrophages in pulmonary alveoli and a slight increase in biliary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4296894" conceptname="Hyperplasia">hyperplasia</span>. In a 21-month study in Swiss albino mice at three oral dosage levels of up to 750 mg/kg per day, benign lung tumors (small <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span>) occurred more frequently in female mice receiving the highest dose than in untreated control animals. There was no increase in malignant or total (benign plus malignant) lung tumors, or in the overall incidence of tumors or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197506" conceptname="Malignant neoplasm of abdomen">malignant tumors</span>. This 21-month study was repeated in CD-1 mice, and no statistically or biologically significant differences were observed between treated and control mice of either sex for any type of tumor.</p>
<p>All mutagenicity tests performed (a dominant lethal study in mice, chromosome studies in somatic cells, a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span>/mammalian-microsome mutagenicity test, and a nucleus anomaly test in somatic interphase nuclei) were negative.</p>
<p>Reproduction toxicity studies in mice, rats and rabbits did not indicate teratogenic potential for metoprolol tartrate. Embryotoxicity and/or fetotoxicity in rats and rabbits were noted starting at doses of 50 mg/kg in rats and 25 mg/kg in rabbits, as demonstrated by increases in preimplantation loss, decreases in the number of viable fetuses per dose, and/or decreases in neonatal survival. High doses were associated with some maternal toxicity, and growth delay of the offspring in utero, which was reflected in minimally lower weights at birth. The oral NOAELs for embryo-fetal development in mice, rats, and rabbits were considered to be 25, 200, and 12.5 mg/kg. This corresponds to dose levels that are approximately 0.3, 4, and 0.5 times, respectively, when based on surface area, the maximum human oral dose (8 mg/kg/day) of metoprolol tartrate. Metoprolol tartrate has been associated with reversible adverse effects on spermatogenesis starting at oral dose levels of 3.5 mg/kg in rats (a dose that is only 0.1-times the human dose, when based on surface area), although other studies have shown no effect of metoprolol tartrate on reproductive performance in male rats. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category C</span></p>
<p>Upon confirming the diagnosis of pregnancy, women should immediately inform the doctor. Metoprolol has been shown to increase postimplantation loss and decrease neonatal survival in rats at doses up to 11 times the maximum daily human dose of 450 mg, when based on surface area. Distribution studies in mice confirm exposure of the fetus when metoprolol is administered to the pregnant animal. These limited animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> (see <span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</span>). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. The amount of data on the use of metoprolol in pregnant women is limited. The risk to the fetus/mother is unknown. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers</span></p>
<p>Metoprolol is excreted in breast milk in a very small quantity. An infant consuming 1 liter of breast milk daily would receive a dose of less than 1 mg of the drug. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Fertility</span></p>
<p>The effects of metoprolol on the fertility of humans have not been studied.</p>
<p>Metoprolol showed effects on spermatogenesis in male rats at a therapeutic dose level, but had no effect on rates of conception at higher doses in animal fertility studies (see <span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</span>).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use</span></p>
<p>Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Geriatric Use</span></p>
<p>In worldwide clinical trials of metoprolol in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, where approximately 478 patients were over 65 years of age (0 over 75 years of age), no age-related differences in safety and effectiveness were found. Other reported clinical experience in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients. However, greater sensitivity of some elderly individuals taking metoprolol cannot be categorically ruled out. Therefore, in general, it is recommended that dosing proceed with caution in this population.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">Management</span></p>
<p>There is no specific antidote.</p>
<p>In general, patients with acute or recent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> may be more hemodynamically unstable than other patients and should be treated accordingly (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#fb3fdc77-f18a-47a3-a2d1-0addfd21f60c">WARNINGS, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">Myocardial Infarction</span></a></span>).</p>
<p>On the basis of the pharmacologic actions of metoprolol, the following general measures should be employed.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Elimination of the Drug: </span>Gastric lavage should be performed.</p>
<p>Other clinical manifestations of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> should be managed symptomatically based on modern methods of intensive care.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span></span></p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">Myocardial Infarction</span></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Early Treatment</span></p>
<p>During the early phase of definite or suspected <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">acute myocardial infarction</span>, initiate treatment with metoprolol tartrate as soon as possible after the patient’s arrival in the hospital. Such treatment should be initiated in a coronary care or similar unit immediately after the patient’s hemodynamic condition has stabilized.</p>
<p>Begin treatment in this early phase with the intravenous administration of three bolus injections of 5 mg of metoprolol tartrate each; give the injections at approximately 2‑minute intervals. During the intravenous administration of metoprolol tartrate, monitor blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram.</p>
<p>In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose (15 mg), initiate metoprolol tartrate tablets, 50 mg every 6 hours, 15 minutes after the last intravenous dose and continue for 48 hours. Thereafter, the maintenance dosage is 100 mg orally twice daily.</p>
<p>Start patients who appear not to tolerate the full intravenous dose on metoprolol tartrate tablets either 25 mg or 50 mg every 6 hours (depending on the degree of intolerance) 15 minutes after the last intravenous dose or as soon as their clinical condition allows. In patients with severe intolerance, discontinue metoprolol (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#fb3fdc77-f18a-47a3-a2d1-0addfd21f60c">WARNINGS</a></span>).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Special populations</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pediatric patients: </span>No pediatric studies have been performed. The safety and efficacy of metoprolol tartrate in pediatric patients have not been established.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal impairment</span>: </span>No dose adjustment of metoprolol tartrate is required in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic impairment</span>: </span>Metoprolol tartrate blood levels are likely to increase substantially in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>. Therefore, metoprolol should be initiated at low doses with cautious gradual dose titration according to clinical response.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Geriatric patients (&gt;65 years): </span>In general, use a low initial starting dose in elderly patients given their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Method of administration: </span>Parenteral administration of metoprolol (ampoule) should be done in a setting with intensive monitoring.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">NOTE: Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.</span></p>
