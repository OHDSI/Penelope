<h1>DESCRIPTION:</h1>
<p class="First">The LidoSiteâ„¢ Topical System (LidoSiteâ„¢ System) consists of a LidoSiteâ„¢ Patch and a LidoSiteâ„¢ Controller, a portable microprocessor-controlled battery-powered DC current source. The LidoSiteâ„¢ System delivers lidocaine and epinephrine simultaneously by topical iontophoresis to achieve dermal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> on intact skin.</p>
<p>Iontophoresis is based on the principle that a soluble salt or drug can be transported across the skin barrier as a part of an electric current induced in the skin. The quantity and distribution of delivered drug(s) is dependent on the ion charge, molecular weight, intensity of the electric current, concentration of the drug(s), contact surface area of the delivery electrode, and duration of current. In most iontophoretic systems, iontophoresis is measured as total charge delivered in milliampere-minutes (mA-min) units. At the patch electrode pH (4.5), lidocaine HCl and epinephrine are both positively charged.</p>
<p>The LidoSiteâ„¢ Controller is designed with a non-replaceable battery that provides up to 99 drug applications at 1.77 mA for 10 minutes (17.7 mA-min).  Refer to the â€œLidoSiteâ„¢ Topical System Instructionsâ€? for proper system operation.</p>
<p>The LidoSiteâ„¢ Patch is for single use only and is disposable. The patch contains a 5-cm<span class="Sup">2</span> circular drug reservoir that delivers lidocaine and epinephrine to the skin and an elongated return reservoir containing electrolytes to complete the electrical circuit.</p>
<p>The drug reservoir contains 100-mg lidocaine HCl, 1.05 mg of epinephrine (equivalent to 1.91 mg of epinephrine bitartrate) and excipients consisting of sodium chloride, glycerin, preservatives (2-phenoxyethanol, methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, butyl-, and isobutyl-p-hydroxybenzoate), citric acid as a buffer and chelator, edetate disodium as a chelator, and sodium metabisulfite as an antioxidant, in a non-sterile hydrogel. The elongated return reservoir contains glycerin, sodium chloride, preservatives (2-phenoxyethanol, methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, butyl-, and isobutyl-p-hydroxybenzoate), and monobasic sodium phosphate as an acidulating agent. The drug and return reservoirs are made from a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) hydrogel.</p>
<p>Lidocaine is a local anesthetic of the amide type. Lidocaine hydrochloride is chemically designated as:</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s6"></a><a name="section-4.1"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action:</span> Lidocaine belongs to the amide class of local anesthetics. Lidocaine blocks sodium ion channels required for the initiation and conduction of nerve impulses resulting in local anesthesia. Epinephrine contributes to the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span> of the LidoSiteâ„¢ System, presumably because of its vasoconstrictor activity, which is thought to decrease the rate of removal of lidocaine from the site of administration.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s7"></a><a name="section-4.2"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hemodynamics:</span> Epinephrine or excessive blood levels of lidocaine may cause changes in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span>, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. However, doses delivered directly to the skin by iontophoresis when LidoSiteâ„¢ System is used as directed are not expected to result in blood levels high enough to cause these hemodynamic effects. (See <a href="#s9">PHARMACOKINETICS</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s8"></a><a name="section-4.3"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pharmacodynamics:</span> In a single-center, prospective, placebo-controlled double-blind study, 20 adult subjects were evaluated to quantify the depth of the anesthetic effect over time from both <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> and sensory perspectives following treatment with the LidoSiteâ„¢ System. The placebo was a LidoSiteâ„¢ System utilizing a patch containing epinephrine only, but with application of current. An 18-gauge needle with constant 200-grams pressure was used to penetrate the skin at a rate of 0.2 mm/sec. Subjects indicated the points at which they felt pressure and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, identified as the sensory penetration depth (SD) and the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> threshold depth (PD), respectively. Immediately following completion of a 10-minute iontophoretic treatment with LidoSiteâ„¢ System, the average SD and the PD were 3.9 mm and 6.4 mm, respectively, compared to 1.4 mm and 3.0 mm, respectively, after placebo treatment. Sixty minutes after removal of the LidoSiteâ„¢ System, the average SD and PD increased to 5.6 mm and 10.7 mm, respectively, compared to 1.4 mm and 3.4 mm, respectively, with placebo treatment.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics:</h2>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s10"></a><a name="section-4.4.1"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span>: Plasma levels of lidocaine were below the minimum level of quantitation, 5 ng/ml, in healthy adult or pediatric subjects after three sequential LidoSiteâ„¢ System applications at different sites over a 3.5 hour period. Epinephrine levels did not exceed the normal physiologic range (10 - 50 pg/mL) in healthy adult subjects after a single standard LidoSiteâ„¢ System application.</p>
<p>CNS toxicity may occur over a range of plasma concentrations of local anesthetics. CNS toxicity may typically be found around 5000 ng/mL of lidocaine. However a small number of patients reportedly may show signs of toxicity at approximately 1000 ng/mL.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s11"></a><a name="section-4.4.2"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Distribution:</span> Lidocaine is 70% protein bound in plasma, mainly to Î±-1-acid glycoprotein. When administered intravenously, the mean volume of distribution for lidocaine (for a 60-kg person) was 90 L at steady state. Lidocaine crosses the placental and blood-brain barriers, presumably by passive diffusion.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s12"></a><a name="section-4.4.3"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Metabolism:</span> It is not known if lidocaine is metabolized in the skin. Lidocaine is metabolized by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys.</p>
<p>The predominant metabolism of lidocaine is through N-dealkylation to monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), and is mainly mediated by CYP3A4. These metabolites are hydrolyzed to 2,6-xylidine, which is converted to 4-hydroxy-2, 6-xylidine (mediated by CYP2A6), the major urinary metabolite in man. Following intravenous administration of lidocaine, MEGX and GX concentrations in serum range from 11 to 36 % and from 5 to 11 % of lidocaine concentrations, respectively. MEGX has an antiarrhythmic and convulsant activity similar to that of lidocaine and a somewhat longer half-life. GX has a weak antiarrhythmic effect but lacks convulsant activity and has a half-life of about 10 hours.</p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s13"></a><a name="section-4.4.4"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Elimination:</span> Lidocaine and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. Following an intravenous bolus injection, the elimination half-life of lidocaine is typically 1.5 to 2.0 hours. Approximately 90% of administered lidocaine is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. During intravenous studies, the elimination half-life of lidocaine was statistically significantly longer in elderly subjects (2.5 hours) than in younger subjects (1.5 hours).</p>

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First">In one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, single-center study, 48 adult subjects were evaluated for the degree of dermal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> upon venipuncture or IV cannulation, typically within 10 minutes following treatment with LidoSiteâ„¢ System or placebo (LidoSiteâ„¢ Patch, no current) treatment. Less <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> was reported following LidoSiteâ„¢ System treatment compared to placebo at both sites, the antecubital fossa and the dorsum of the hand, as measured by a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS). All subjects received treatment on each of their antecubital fossae prior to venipuncture, and on the dorsum of each hand prior to cannulation. Three of the treatments were with LidoSiteâ„¢ System and one was with placebo. VAS scores for active and placebo treatments were 0.7 and 3.2, respectively, at the antecubital fossa, and 1.6 and 4.0, respectively, on the dorsum of the hand.</p>
<p>In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center study, 48 pediatric patients were stratified by age group (5 to 7 years, 8 to 11 years, and 12 to 18 years) to compare the efficacy of LidoSiteâ„¢ System with placebo (LidoSiteâ„¢ Patch, no current) in the reduction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> associated with venipuncture in the antecubital fossa.</p>
<p>Venipuncture occurred within 10 minutes of patch removal. Based on the Nine Face Integrated Scale (NFIS) scores (â€œA through Iâ€? scale, with an â€œAâ€? face indicating a laughing child and an â€œIâ€? face indicating a child <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4136768" conceptname="Crying">crying</span> vigorously), patients treated with LidoSiteâ„¢ System experienced less <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> during venipuncture than subjects treated with the placebo patch. The mean NFIS scores, calculated by equating â€œAâ€? through â€œIâ€? with â€œ1â€? through â€œ9,â€? respectively, for all age groups were 2.8 and 4.3 for LidoSiteâ„¢ System and placebo, respectively.</p>
<p>Two prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (a patch with only epinephrine and with current applied) trials were conducted to assess the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> provided within 10 minutes following treatment during venipuncture or intravenous cannulation. The first trial used a 10-cm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score to assess <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> experienced by 270 subjects â‰¥ 18 years of age. The mean (SD) VAS score was significantly lower in the LidoSiteâ„¢ System group, 0.8 (1.5) compared to the placebo group, 2.5 (2.3). The second trial utilized the NFIS to evaluate the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> experienced by 256 pediatric subjects ages 5 to 17 years. The median NFIS scores for all subjects in the LidoSiteâ„¢ System and placebo treatment groups were C and E, respectively.</p>

Sixty-six subjects (ages 9 to 79 years) were randomized to LidoSiteâ„¢ System or placebo, (LidoSiteâ„¢ System, a patch with only epinephrine and with current applied) prior to laser treatment. The dermatological procedures were performed within 20 minutes following treatment. At the end of the procedure, subjects rated their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> using the Ordered Category Anesthesia Scale (OCAS) (with 0 indicating no sensation and 6 indicating intolerable <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>). In the LidoSiteâ„¢ System group, 91% of subjects reported no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> or mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090431" conceptname="Discomfort">discomfort</span> (OCAS scores of 0 to 3) compared to 53% of subjects in the placebo group. Among LidoSiteâ„¢ System subjects, 4% of adults and 14% of children required supplemental anesthetic during the procedure compared to 21% of adults and 33% of children who received placebo treatments.</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34072-9">
<a name="s29"></a><a name="section-9.1"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">General:</span> Since amide-type local anesthetics are metabolized by the liver, LidoSiteâ„¢ System should be used with caution in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span>. Patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span> normally are at a greater risk of developing toxic plasma concentrations.</p>
<p>LidoSiteâ„¢ System should be used with caution in persons with known drug sensitivities. Patients allergic to para-amino-benzoic acid derivatives (procaine, tetracaine, benzocaine, etc.) have not shown cross sensitivity to lidocaine. Nevertheless, LidoSiteâ„¢ System should be used with caution in patients with a history of drug sensitivities, especially if the etiologic agent is uncertain.</p>
<p>Lidocaine and epinephrine should be used with caution in patients with impaired cardiovascular function since they may be less able to compensate for changes in cardiac conduction, contractility, and oxygen demand that may be caused by systemic exposure to these drugs.</p>

<h2>Most Common Adverse Events</h2>
<p class="First">In placebo-controlled studies with LidoSiteâ„¢ System, 4.5% of patients on placebo (N=333) and 4.5% of patients on LidoSiteâ„¢ System (N=330) reported an adverse event. Because the placebo groups were not "no treatment" groups, but instead generally utilized an unaltered LidoSiteâ„¢ Patch or an epinephrine only-containing patch with application of current, comparing the incidence of adverse events between the placebo and LidoSiteâ„¢ System groups may not fully elucidate the incidence of adverse events that are attributable to iontophoresis, epinephrine or local irritation from patch application.

There were no serious adverse events attributed to LidoSiteâ„¢ System treatment.

<h1>OVERDOSAGE:</h1>
<p class="First">Acute emergencies from local anesthetics are generally related to high plasma levels encountered during therapeutic use. (See <a href="#s45">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a>, <a href="#s22">WARNINGS</a> and <a href="#s28">PRECAUTIONS.</a>) High lidocaine plasma levels are unlikely to occur from administration of LidoSiteâ„¢ System when used as directed.</p>
<p>Repeated applications, multiple simultaneous applications, application in smaller patients, or in patients with impaired elimination may all contribute to increased blood concentrations of lidocaine. In addition, if other local anesthetics are administered at the same time, e.g. topically or by injection, the toxic effects are thought to be additive and could result in an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> with systemic toxic reactions. There is generally an increase in severity of symptoms with increasing plasma concentrations of lidocaine. Systemic central nervous system (CNS) toxicity may occur over a range of plasma concentrations of local anesthetics. CNS toxicity may typically be found around 5000 ng/mL of lidocaine, however a small number of patients reportedly may show signs of toxicity at approximately 1000 ng/mL. CNS symptoms usually precede cardiovascular manifestations.</p>
<p>Plasma levels of lidocaine were below the minimum level of quantitation, 5 ng/ml, in healthy adult or pediatric subjects after three sequential LidoSiteâ„¢ System applications on different sites over a 3.5-hour period. Toxic levels of lidocaine may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>, decreases in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span>, total peripheral resistance and mean arterial pressure, as well as life-threatening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">dysrhythmias</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span>. The management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> includes close monitoring, supportive care, and symptomatic treatment. Dialysis is of negligible value in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">acute overdose</span> with lidocaine.

<h2>General description:</h2>
<p class="First">The LidoSiteâ„¢ Topical System utilizes a solid-state electronic controller and a pre-filled patch to form an iontophoretic drug delivery system. The LidoSiteâ„¢ Controller requires only an ON button actuation to start the treatment. Two light emitting diode (LED) indicators inform the user of the delivery status. The LidoSiteâ„¢ Controller is designed with a non-replaceable battery that provides up to 99 drug applications at 1.77 mA for 10 minutes (17.7 mA-min).</p>

<p>The LidoSiteâ„¢ Controller has an internal beeper that sounds when the ON button is pressed, at the end of every delivery, and at the end of the self-check function.</p>
<p>When the ON button is pressed, the unit provides one beep. At the end of a delivery, there is a beep every second for three seconds which repeats every thirty seconds. The sequence continues for thirty minutes or until the patch is removed from the controller. It should be noted that this signal is present at the termination of a delivery, whether successful or not.</p>
<p>At the end of the self-check function, the unit provides one quick beep.</p>
