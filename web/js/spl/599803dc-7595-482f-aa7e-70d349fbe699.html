<h2>Central Nervous System</h2>
<p class="First">Oxycodone is a semisynthetic pure opioid agonist whose principal
                           therapeutic action is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>. Other pharmacological effects of
                           oxycodone include anxiolysis, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142453" conceptname="Feeling high">euphoria</span> and feelings of relaxation. These
                           effects are mediated by receptors (notably μ and κ) in the central
                           nervous system for endogenous opioid-like compounds such as endorphins
                           and enkephalins. Oxycodone produces <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> through direct
                           activity at respiratory centers in the brain stem and depresses the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span>
                           reflex by direct effect on the center of the medulla.</p>
<p>Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) works by inhibiting the body’s
                           production of prostaglandins, including prostaglandins involved in
                           <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span>. Prostaglandins cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> sensations by stimulating muscle
                           contractions and dilating blood vessels throughout the body. In the CNS,
                           aspirin works on the hypothalamus heat-regulating center to reduce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>,
                           however, other mechanisms may be involved.</p>

<h2>Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle</h2>
<p class="First">Oxycodone reduces motility by increasing smooth muscle tone in
                           the stomach and duodenum. In the small intestine, digestion of food is
                           delayed by decreases in propulsive contractions. Other opioid effects
                           include contraction of biliary tract smooth muscle, spasm of the
                           Sphincter of Oddi, increased ureteral and bladder sphincter tone, and a
                           reduction in uterine tone. </p>
<p>Aspirin can produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168618" conceptname="Injury of gastrointestinal tract">gastrointestinal injury</span> (lesions, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcers</span>)
                           through a mechanism that is not yet completely understood, but may
                           involve a reduction in eicosanoid synthesis by the gastric mucosa.
                           Decreased production of prostaglandins may compromise the defenses of the
                           gastric mucosa and the activity of substances involved in tissue repair
                           and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcer</span> healing.</p>

<h2>Cardiovascular System</h2>
<p class="First">Oxycodone may produce a release of histamine and may be

<h2>Platelet Aggregation</h2>
<p class="First">Aspirin affects platelet aggregation by irreversibly inhibiting
                           prostaglandin cyclo-oxygenase. This effect lasts for the life of the
                           platelet and prevents the formation of the platelet aggregating factor
                           thromboxane A2. Nonacetylated salicylates do not inhibit this enzyme and
                           have no effect on platelet aggregation. At somewhat higher doses, aspirin
                           reversibly inhibits the formation of prostaglandin 12 (prostacyclin),
                           which is an arterial vasodilator and inhibits platelet
                        aggregation.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Absorption</p>
<p>The mean absolute oral bioavailability of oxycodone in cancer
                           patients was reported to be about 87%. This high oral
                           bioavailability is due to low pre-systemic elimination and/or first-pass
                           metabolism. </p>
<p>Distribution </p>
<p>The volume of distribution after intravenous administration is
                           211.9 ±186.6 L. Oxycodone has been shown to be 45% bound
                           to human plasma proteins <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>.
                           Oxycodone has been found in breast milk (see <a href="#S26D72E75-7A1B-4239-BAB8-24AB0B13B269">PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>
<p>Aspirin is hydrolyzed primarily to salicylic acid in the gut wall
                           and during first-pass metabolism through the liver. Salicylic acid is
                           absorbed rapidly from the stomach, but most of the absorption occurs in
                           the proximal small intestine. Following absorption, salicylate is
                           distributed to most body tissues and fluids, including fetal tissues,
                           breast milk, and the CNS. High concentrations are found in the liver and
                           kidneys. Salicylate is variably bound to serum proteins, particularly
                           albumin.</p>
<p>Metabolism</p>
<p>Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic
                           pathways to produce noroxycodone, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone, which
                           are subsequently glucuronidated. Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone are the
                           major circulating metabolites. CYP3A4 mediated N-demthylation to
                           noroxycodone is the primary metabolite pathway of oxycodone with a lower
                           contribution from CYP2D6 mediated O-demthylation to oxymorphone.
                           Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory,
                           be affected by other drugs (see <a href="#KS01-S21E577C5-9BC4-4953-8BA2-F765A4106461">Drug-Drug
                              Interactions</a>). </p>
<p>Noroxycodone exhibits very weak anti-nociceptive potency compared
                           to oxycodone, however, it undergoes further oxidation to produce
                           noroxymorphone, which is active at opioid receptors. Although
                           noroxymorphone is an active metabolite and present at relatively high
                           concentrations in circulation, it does not appear to cross the
                           blood-brain barrier to a significant extent. Oxymorphone is present in
                           the plasma only at low concentrations and undergoes further metabolism to
                           form its glucuronide and noroxymorphone. Oxymorphone has been shown to be
                           active and possessing analgesic activity but its contribution to
                           <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> following oxycodone administration is thought to be clinically
                           insignificant, based on the amount formed. Other metabolites (α- and
                           β-oxycodol, noroxycodol and oxymorphol) may be present at very low
                           concentrations and demonstrate limited penetration into the brain as
                           compared to oxycodone. The enzymes responsible for keto-reduction and
                           glucuronidation pathways in oxycodone metabolism have not been
                           established.</p>
<p>The biotransformation of aspirin occurs primarily in the liver by
                           the microsomal enzyme system. With a plasma half-life of approximately 15
                           minutes, aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed to salicylate. At low doses,
                           salicylate elimination follows first-order kinetics. The plasma half-life
                           of salicylate is approximately 2 to 3 hours.</p>
<p>Excretion</p>
<p>Free and conjugated noroxycodone, free and conjugated oxycodone,
                           and oxymorphone are excreted in human urine following a single oral dose
                           of oxycodone. Approximately 8% to 14% of the dose is
                           excreted as free oxycodone over 24 hours after administration. </p>
<p>Approximately 10% of aspirin is excreted as unchanged salicylate
                           in the urine. The major metabolites excreted in the urine are salicyluric
                           acid (75%), salicyl phenolic glucuronide (10%), salicyl acyl glucuronide
                           (5%), and gentisic and gentisuric acid (less than 1%) each. Eighty to
                           100% of a single dose is excreted in the urine within 24 to 72
                        hours.</p>

<p>Inhibitors of CYP3A4:<br>
                           Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of PERCODAN, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations. A published study showed that the co-administration of the antifungal drug, voriconazole, increased oxycodone AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 3.6 and 1.7 fold, respectively. The expected clinical results would be increased or prolonged opioid effects.</p>
<p>Inducers of CYP450:<br>
                           CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations.  A published study showed that the co-administration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone (oral) AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 86% and 63% respectively.  The expected clinical results would be lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> to oxycodone.  Induction of CYP3A4 may be of greatest importance given oxycodone’s metabolic pathways.

                           are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are
                           subject to criminal diversion.</p>
<p>Oxycodone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid
                           agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or
                           dispensing PERCODAN tablets in situations where the physician or
                           pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or
                           diversion. Concerns about misuse, addiction, and diversion should not
                           prevent the proper management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>.</p>
<p>PERCODAN tablets may be abused by crushing, snorting or injecting the product. These practices pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. </p>
<p>Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional
                           Licensing Board, or State Controlled Substances Authority for information
                           on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</p>
<p>Administration of PERCODAN (Oxycodone and Aspirin Tablets, USP)
                           tablets should be closely monitored for the following potentially serious

<p class="First"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">Respiratory depression</span> is a hazard with the use of oxycodone, one
                           of the active ingredients in PERCODAN tablets, as with all opioid

                           result in alteration in maternal and neonatal hemostasis mechanisms.
                           Maternal aspirin use during later stages of pregnancy may cause low birth

<ol>
<li>Patients should be aware that PERCODAN tablets contain oxycodone,
                              which is a morphine-like substance.</li>
<li>Patients should be instructed to keep PERCODAN tablets in a secure

                              tablets.</li>
<li>Nursing mothers should consult with their physicians about whether
                              to discontinue nursing or discontinue PERCODAN tablets because of the
                              potential for serious adverse reactions to nursing infants.</li>
<li>Patients who are treated with PERCODAN tablets for more than a few
                              weeks should be advised not to abruptly discontinue the medication.
                              Patients should consult with their physician for a gradual

<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">Although oxycodone may cross-react with some drug urine tests, no
                           available studies were found which determined the duration of
                           detectability of oxycodone in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4215138" conceptname="Drug screening test">urine drug screens</span>. However, based on
                           pharmacokinetic data, the approximate duration of detectability for a
                           single dose of oxycodone is roughly estimated to be one to two days
                           following drug exposure. </p>
<p>Urine testing for opiates may be performed to determine illicit
                           drug use and for medical reasons such as evaluation of patients with
                           altered states of consciousness or monitoring efficacy of drug
                           rehabilitation efforts. The preliminary identification of opiates in
                           urine involves the use of an immunoassay screening and thin-layer
                           chromatography (TLC). Gas chromatography/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> spectrometry (GC/MS) may be
                           utilized as a third-stage identification step in the medical
                           investigational sequence for opiate testing after immunoassay and TLC.
                           The identities of 6-keto opiates (e.g., oxycodone) can further be
                           differentiated by the analysis of their methoxime-trimethylsilyl (MO-TMS)
                           derivative.</p>

<h2>Drug/Drug Interactions with Oxycodone</h2>
<p class="First">CYP3A4 Inhibitors and CYP450 Inducers:<br>
                        Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways. CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in noroxycodone formation followed by CYP2B6, CYP2C9/19 and CYP2D6. Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations and prolonged opioid effects.  Similarly, CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> to oxycodone.</p>
<p>If co-administration with PERCODAN is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP3A4 inhibitors or CYP450 inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved.</p>
<p>Skeletal Muscle Relaxants:<br>
                           Opioid analgesics may enhance the neuromuscular-blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increase in the degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>.</p>
<p>CNS Depressants:<br>
                           Patients receiving CNS depressants such as other opioid
                           analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers,
                           centrally-acting anti-emetics, sedative-hypnotics or other CNS
                           depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with PERCODAN tablets may
                           exhibit an additive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span>. When such combined therapy is
                           contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced.</p>
<p>Analgesics:<br>
                           Agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine,
                           naltrexone, and butorphanol) should be administered with caution to a
                           patient who has received or is receiving a pure opioid agonist such as
                           oxycodone. These agonist/antagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic
                           effect of oxycodone or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms.</p>

<h2>Drug/Drug Interactions with Aspirin</h2>
<p class="First">Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors: The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">hyponatremic</span>
                           and hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors may be diminished by the
                           concomitant administration of aspirin due to its indirect effect on the
                           renin-angiotensin conversion pathway. </p>
<p>Acetazolamide: Concurrent use of aspirin and acetazolamide can
                           lead to high serum concentrations of acetazolamide (and toxicity) due to
                           competition at the renal tubule for secretion. </p>
<p>Anticoagulant Therapy (Heparin and Warfarin): Patients on
                           anticoagulation therapy are at increased risk for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> because of
                           drug-drug interactions and the effect on platelets. Aspirin can displace
                           warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolongation of both the
                           <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time and the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4219104" conceptname="Bleeding time">bleeding time</span>. Aspirin can increase the
                           anticoagulant activity of heparin, increasing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> risk. </p>
<p>Anticonvulsants: Salicylate can displace protein-bound phenytoin
                           and valproic acid, leading to a decrease in the total concentration of
                           phenytoin and an increase in serum valproic acid levels.</p>
<p>Beta Blockers: The hypotensive effects of beta blockers may be
                           diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition
                           of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow, and salt
                           and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4125002" conceptname="Idiopathic fluid retention">fluid retention</span>.</p>
<p>Diuretics: The effectiveness of diuretics in patients with
                           underlying renal or cardiovascular disease may be diminished by the
                           concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal
                           prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid
                           retention. </p>
<p>Methotrexate: Aspirin may enhance the serious side and toxicity
                           of methotrexate due to displacement from its plasma protein binding sites
                           and/or reduced renal clearance. </p>
<p>Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAID's): The concurrent
                           use of aspirin with other NSAID's should be avoided because this may
                           increase <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> or lead to decreased renal function. Aspirin may
                           enhance the serious side effects and toxicity of ketorolac, due to
                           displacement from its plasma protein binding sites and/or reduced renal
                           clearance.</p>
<p>Oral Hypoglycemics Agents: Aspirin may increase the serum
                           glucose-lowering action of insulin and sulfonylureas leading to
                           <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. </p>
<p>Uricosuric Agents: Salicylates antagonize the uricosuric action

<h2>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Depending on the sensitivity/specificity and the test
                           methodology, the individual components of PERCODAN tablets may
                           cross-react with assays used in the preliminary detection of cocaine
                           (primary urinary metabolite, benzoylecgonine) or marijuana (cannabinoids)
                           in human urine. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in
                           order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. The preferred confirmatory
                           method is gas chromatography/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> spectrometry (GC/MS). Moreover,
                           clinical considerations and professional judgment should be applied to

                           results are used.</p>
<p>Salicylates may increase the protein bound iodine (PBI) result by
                           competing for the protein binding sites on pre-albumin and possibly

<h3>Nonteratogenic Effects</h3>
<p class="First">Opioids can cross the placental barrier and have the

<h2>Labor and Delivery</h2>
<p class="First">PERCODAN tablets are not recommended for use in women during and
                           immediately prior to labor and delivery due to its potential effects on
                           respiratory function in the newborn. Aspirin should be avoided one week
                           prior to and during labor and delivery because it can result in excessive
                           blood loss at delivery. Prolonged gestation and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434714" conceptname="Prolonged second stage of labor">prolonged labor</span> due to

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Ordinarily, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is
                           receiving PERCODAN tablets because of the possibility of sedation and/or
                           <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> in the infant. Oxycodone is excreted in breast
                           milk in low concentrations, and there have been rare reports of
                           <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4061577" conceptname="Lethargy">lethargy</span> in babies of nursing mothers taking an

                           breast milk. Adverse effects on platelet function in the nursing infant
                           exposed to aspirin in breast milk may be a potential risk. Furthermore,
                           the risk of <span class="Bold">Reye Syndrome</span> caused by
                           salicylate in breast milk is unknown. Because of the potential for
                           serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made
                           whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into
                           account the potential benefits to the woman and the possible hazards to
                           the nursing infant.</p>

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">PERCODAN tablets should not be administered to pediatric
                           patients. Reye Syndrome is a rare but serious disease which can follow
                           flu or chicken pox in children and teenagers. While the cause of Reye
                           Syndrome is unknown, some reports claim aspirin (or salicylates) may
                           increase the risk of developing this disease.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Special precaution should be given when determining the dosing
                           amount and frequency of PERCODAN tablets for geriatric patients, since
                           clearance of oxycodone may be slightly reduced in this patient population
                           when compared to younger patients.</p>

<h2>Treatment</h2>
<p class="First">Primary attention should be given to the reestablishment of
                           adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and
                           the institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Supportive
                           measures (including oxygen, intravenous fluids, and vasopressors) should
                           be employed in the management of circulatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4078925" conceptname="Pulmonary edema">pulmonary edema</span>
                           accompanying <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> as indicated. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">Cardiac arrest</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span> may
                           require cardiac massage or defibrillation. Treatment of acid-base
                           disturbances and electrolyte disorders is also important. Because of the
                           concern over salicylate toxicity, acid-base status should be followed
                           closely with serial blood gas and serum pH determinations.</p>
<p>The opioid antagonist naloxone hydrochloride is a specific
                           antidote against <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> which may result from overdosage
                           or unusual sensitivity to opioids including oxycodone. Therefore, an
                           appropriate dose of naloxone hydrochloride should be administered (usual
                           initial adult dose 0.4 mg-2 mg) preferably by the intravenous route,
                           simultaneously with efforts at respiratory resuscitation. Since the
                           duration of action of oxycodone may exceed that of the antagonist, the
                           patient should be kept under continued surveillance and repeated doses of
                           the antagonist should be administered as needed to maintain adequate
                           respiration. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence
                           of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> secondary
                           to oxycodone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. In patients who are physically dependent on any
                           opioid agonist including oxycodone, an abrupt or complete reversal of
                           opioid effects may precipitate an acute abstinence syndrome. The severity
                           of the withdrawal syndrome produced will depend on the degree of physical
                           <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> and the dose of the antagonist administered. Please see the
                           prescribing information for the specific opioid antagonist for details of
                           their proper use.</p>
<p>Gastric emptying and/or lavage may be useful in removing
                           unabsorbed drug. This procedure is recommended as soon as possible after
                           ingestion, even if the patient has <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomited</span> spontaneously. After lavage
                           and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span>, administration of activated charcoal, as a slurry, is
                           beneficial, if less than three hours have passed since ingestion.
                           Charcoal adsorption should not be employed prior to lavage and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span>.</p>

<p>Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis can be performed to reduce

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Dosage should be adjusted according to the severity of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> and the
                     response of the patient. It may occasionally be necessary to exceed the usual
                     dosage recommended below in cases of more severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> or in those patients who
                     have become tolerant to the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span> of opioids. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> is constant,
                     the opioid analgesic should be given at regular intervals on an
                     around-the-clock schedule. PERCODAN tablets are given orally. </p>
<p>The usual dosage is one tablet every 6 hours as needed for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>. The
                     maximum daily dose of aspirin should not exceed 4 grams or 12
                  tablets.</p>

<h2>Cessation of Therapy</h2>
<p class="First">In patients treated with PERCODAN tablets for more than a few
                           weeks who no longer require therapy, doses should be tapered gradually to
                           prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the physically dependent
                           patient.</p>

<h1>DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></h1>
<p class="First">PERCODAN tablets are a Schedule II controlled substance. Oxycodone is a
                     mu-agonist opioid with an abuse liability similar to morphine. Oxycodone, like
                     morphine and other opioids used in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, can be abused and is subject to
                     criminal diversion.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug addiction</span> is defined as an abnormal, compulsive use, use for
                     non-medical purposes of a substance despite physical, psychological,
                     occupational or interpersonal difficulties resulting from such use, and
                     continued use despite harm or risk of harm. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug addiction</span> is a treatable
                     disease, utilizing a multi-disciplinary approach, but relapse is common. Opioid
                     addiction is relatively rare in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436096" conceptname="Chronic pain">chronic pain</span> but may be more
                     common in individuals who have a past history of alcohol or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4279309" conceptname="Substance abuse">substance abuse</span> or
                     <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>. Pseudoaddiction refers to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relief seeking behavior of patients
                     whose <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> is poorly managed. It is considered an iatrogenic effect of
                     ineffective <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> management. The health care provider must assess continuously
                     the psychological and clinical condition of a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> patient in order to
                     distinguish addiction from pseudoaddiction and thus, be able to treat the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>
                     adequately. </p>
<p>Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> on a prescribed medication does not signify
                     addiction. Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> involves the occurrence of a withdrawal syndrome
                     when there is sudden reduction or cessation in drug use or if an opiate
                     antagonist is administered. Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> can be detected after a few
                     days of opioid therapy. However, clinically significant physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> is
                     only seen after several weeks of relatively high dosage therapy. In this case,
                     abrupt discontinuation of the opioid may result in a withdrawal syndrome. If
                     the discontinuation of opioids is therapeutically indicated, gradual tapering
                     of the drug over a 2-week period will prevent withdrawal symptoms. The severity
                     of the withdrawal syndrome depends primarily on the daily dosage of the opioid,
                     the duration of therapy and medical status of the individual. </p>
<p>The withdrawal syndrome of oxycodone is similar to that of morphine.
                     This syndrome is characterized by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089239" conceptname="Yawning">yawning</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, increased heart rate and

<p>“Drug-seeking? behavior is very common in addicts and drug abusers.
                     Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office
                     hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral,
                     repeated “loss? of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance
                     to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating
                     physician(s). “Doctor shopping? to obtain additional prescriptions is common
                     among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction.</p>
<p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>
                     and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied
                     by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> in all addicts. In
                     addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction and is
                     characterized by misuse for non-medical purposes, often in combination with
                     other psychoactive substances. Oxycodone, like other opioids, has been diverted
                     for non-medical use. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information,
                     including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised.</p>
<p>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices,
                     periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are
                     appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</p>
<p>Like other opioid medications, PERCODAN tablets are subject to the
                     Federal Controlled Substances Act. After chronic use, PERCODAN tablets should
                     not be discontinued abruptly when it is thought that the patient has become
                     physically dependent on oxycodone.</p>
