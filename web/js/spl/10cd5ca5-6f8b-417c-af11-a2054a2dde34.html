<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC<span class="Sub">4</span>, LTD<span class="Sub">4</span>, LTE<span class="Sub">4</span>) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. These eicosanoids bind to cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) receptors. The CysLT type-1 (CysLT<span class="Sub">1</span>) receptor is found in the human airway (including airway smooth muscle cells and airway macrophages) and on other pro-inflammatory cells (including eosinophils and certain myeloid stem cells). CysLTs have been correlated with the pathophysiology of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="257007" conceptname="Allergic rhinitis">allergic rhinitis</span>. In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>, leukotriene-mediated effects include airway <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span>, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process. In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="257007" conceptname="Allergic rhinitis">allergic rhinitis</span>, CysLTs are released from the nasal mucosa after allergen exposure during both early- and late-phase reactions and are associated with symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="257007" conceptname="Allergic rhinitis">allergic rhinitis</span>. Intranasal challenge with CysLTs has been shown to increase nasal airway resistance and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4334403" conceptname="Nasal obstruction">nasal obstruction</span>. SINGULAIR has not been assessed in intranasal challenge studies. The clinical relevance of intranasal challenge studies is unknown. </p>
<p>Montelukast is an orally active compound that binds with high affinity and selectivity to the CysLT<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor (in preference to other pharmacologically important airway receptors, such as the prostanoid, cholinergic, or Î²-adrenergic receptor). Montelukast inhibits physiologic actions of LTD<span class="Sub">4</span> at the CysLT<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor without any agonist activity.</p>

<h2>Absorption</h2>
<p class="First">Montelukast is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. After administration of the 10-mg film-coated tablet to fasted adults, the mean peak montelukast plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) is achieved in 3 to 4 hours (T<span class="Sub">max</span>). The mean oral bioavailability is 64%. The oral bioavailability and C<span class="Sub">max</span> are not influenced by a standard meal in the morning. </p>
<p>For the 5-mg chewable tablet, the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> is achieved in 2 to 2.5 hours after administration to adults in the fasted state. The mean oral bioavailability is 73% in the fasted state versus 63% when administered with a standard meal in the morning. </p>
<p>For the 4-mg chewable tablet, the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> is achieved 2 hours after administration in pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age in the fasted state. </p>
<p>The 4-mg oral granule formulation is bioequivalent to the 4-mg chewable tablet when administered to adults in the fasted state. The co-administration of the oral granule formulation with applesauce did not have a clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of montelukast. A high fat meal in the morning did not affect the AUC of montelukast oral granules; however, the meal decreased C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 35% and prolonged T<span class="Sub">max</span> from 2.3 Â± 1.0 hours to 6.4 Â± 2.9 hours. </p>
<p>The safety and efficacy of SINGULAIR in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> were demonstrated in clinical trials in which the 10-mg film-coated tablet and 5-mg chewable tablet formulations were administered in the evening without regard to the time of food ingestion. The safety of SINGULAIR in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> was also demonstrated in clinical trials in which the 4-mg chewable tablet and 4-mg oral granule formulations were administered in the evening without regard to the time of food ingestion. The safety and efficacy of SINGULAIR in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280726" conceptname="Seasonal allergic rhinitis">seasonal allergic rhinitis</span> were demonstrated in clinical trials in which the 10-mg film-coated tablet was administered in the morning or evening without regard to the time of food ingestion. </p>
<p>The comparative pharmacokinetics of montelukast when administered as two 5-mg chewable tablets versus one 10-mg film-coated tablet have not been evaluated. </p>

<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p class="First">Montelukast is more than 99% bound to plasma proteins. The steady state volume of distribution of montelukast averages 8 to 11 liters. Studies in rats with radiolabeled montelukast indicate minimal distribution across the blood-brain barrier. In addition, concentrations of radiolabeled material at 24 hours postdose were minimal in all other tissues.</p>

<h2>Metabolism</h2>
<p class="First">Montelukast is extensively metabolized. In studies with therapeutic doses, plasma concentrations of metabolites of montelukast are undetectable at steady state in adults and pediatric patients. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies using human liver microsomes indicate that cytochromes P450 3A4 and 2C9 are involved in the metabolism of montelukast. Clinical studies investigating the effect of known inhibitors of cytochromes P450 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, erythromycin) or 2C9 (e.g., fluconazole) on montelukast pharmacokinetics have not been conducted. Based on further <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> results in human liver microsomes, therapeutic plasma concentrations of montelukast do not inhibit cytochromes P450 3A4, 2C9, 1A2, 2A6, 2C19, or 2D6 (see <a href="#i4i_interactions_id_15b30c24-b92e-441b-8317-3596d21da459">Drug Interactions</a>). <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies have shown that montelukast is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8; however, data from a clinical drug-drug interaction study involving montelukast and rosiglitazone (a probe substrate representative of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP2C8) demonstrated that montelukast does not inhibit CYP2C8 <span class="Italics">in vivo</span>, and therefore is not anticipated to alter the metabolism of drugs metabolized by this enzyme (see <a href="#i4i_interactions_id_15b30c24-b92e-441b-8317-3596d21da459">Drug Interactions</a>).</p>

<h2>Elimination</h2>
<p class="First">The plasma clearance of montelukast averages 45 mL/min in healthy adults. Following an oral dose of radiolabeled montelukast, 86% of the radioactivity was recovered in 5-day fecal collections and &lt;0.2% was recovered in urine. Coupled with estimates of montelukast oral bioavailability, this indicates that montelukast and its metabolites are excreted almost exclusively via the bile. </p>
<p>In several studies, the mean plasma half-life of montelukast ranged from 2.7 to 5.5 hours in healthy young adults. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are nearly linear for oral doses up to 50 mg. During once-daily dosing with 10-mg montelukast, there is little accumulation of the parent drug in plasma (14%).</p>

<h2>Elderly</h2>
<p class="First">The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">Hepatic Insufficiency</span></h2>
<p class="First">Patients with mild-to-moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic insufficiency</span> and clinical evidence of cirrhosis had evidence of decreased metabolism of montelukast resulting in 41% (90% CI=7%, 85%) higher mean montelukast area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) following a single 10-mg dose. The elimination of montelukast was slightly prolonged compared with that in healthy subjects (mean half-life, 7.4 hours). No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic insufficiency</span>.

<h2>Adolescents and Pediatric Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the systemic exposure of the 4-mg oral granule formulation in pediatric patients 6 to 23 months of age, the 4-mg chewable tablets in pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age, the 5-mg chewable tablets in pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age, and the 10-mg film-coated tablets in young adults and adolescents â‰¥15 years of age. </p>
<p>The plasma concentration profile of montelukast following administration of the 10-mg film-coated tablet is similar in adolescents â‰¥15 years of age and young adults. The 10-mg film-coated tablet is recommended for use in patients â‰¥15 years of age.</p>
<p>The mean systemic exposure of the 4-mg chewable tablet in pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age and the 5-mg chewable tablets in pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age is similar to the mean systemic exposure of the 10-mg film-coated tablet in adults. The 5-mg chewable tablet should be used in pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age and the 4-mg chewable tablet should be used in pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age. </p>
<p>In children 6 to 11 months of age, the systemic exposure to montelukast and the variability of plasma montelukast concentrations were higher than those observed in adults. Based on population analyses, the mean AUC (4296 ngâ€¢hr/mL [range 1200 to 7153]) was 60% higher and the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> (667 ng/mL [range 201 to 1058]) was 89% higher than those observed in adults (mean AUC 2689 ngâ€¢hr/mL [range 1521 to 4595]) and mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> (353 ng/mL [range 180 to 548]). The systemic exposure in children 12 to 23 months of age was less variable, but was still higher than that observed in adults. The mean AUC (3574 ngâ€¢hr/mL [range 2229 to 5408]) was 33% higher and the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> (562 ng/mL [range 296 to 814]) was 60% higher than those observed in adults. Safety and tolerability of montelukast in a single-dose pharmacokinetic study in 26 children 6 to 23 months of age were similar to that of patients two years and above (see <a href="#i4i_adverse_effects_id_61b4d964-38bb-4338-a0c3-4465473d4fd0">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a>). The 4-mg oral granule formulation should be used for pediatric patients 12 to 23 months of age for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>, or for pediatric patients 6 to 23 months of age for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="40486433" conceptname="Perennial allergic rhinitis">perennial allergic rhinitis</span>. Since the 4-mg oral granule formulation is bioequivalent to the 4-mg chewable tablet, it can also be used as an alternative formulation to the 4-mg chewable tablet in pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Montelukast at a dose of 10 mg once daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state: </p>
<ul>
<li>did not cause clinically significant changes in the kinetics of a single intravenous dose of theophylline (predominantly a cytochrome P450 1A2 substrate). </li>
<li>did not change the pharmacokinetic profile of warfarin (primarily a substrate of CYP 2C9, 3A4 and 1A2) or influence the effect of a single 30-mg oral dose of warfarin on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time or the INR (International Normalized Ratio). </li>
<li>did not change the pharmacokinetic profile or urinary excretion of immunoreactive digoxin. </li>
<li>did not change the plasma concentration profile of terfenadine (a substrate of CYP 3A4) or fexofenadine, its carboxylated metabolite, and did not prolong the QTc interval following co-administration with terfenadine 60 mg twice daily. </li>
</ul>
<p>Montelukast at doses of â‰¥100 mg daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state: </p>
<ul>
<li>did not significantly alter the plasma concentrations of either component of an oral contraceptive containing norethindrone 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg. </li>
<li>did not cause any clinically significant change in plasma profiles of prednisone or prednisolone following administration of either oral prednisone or intravenous prednisolone.</li>
</ul>
<p> Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of montelukast approximately 40% following a single 10-mg dose of montelukast. No dosage adjustment for SINGULAIR is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with SINGULAIR. </p>
<p>Montelukast is a potent inhibitor of P450 2C8 <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>. However, data from a clinical drug-drug interaction study involving montelukast and rosiglitazone (a probe substrate representative of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP2C8) in 12 healthy individuals demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone are not altered when the drugs are coadministered, indicating that montelukast does not inhibit CYP2C8 <span class="Italics">in vivo </span>. Therefore, montelukast is not anticipated to alter the metabolism of drugs metabolized by this enzyme (e.g., paclitaxel, rosiglitazone, and repaglinide.)</p>

<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">Montelukast causes inhibition of airway cysteinyl leukotriene receptors as demonstrated by the ability to inhibit <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256717" conceptname="Bronchospasm">bronchoconstriction</span> due to inhaled LTD<span class="Sub">4</span> in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatics</span>.

<p>The effect of SINGULAIR on eosinophils in the peripheral blood was examined in clinical trials. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> aged 2 years and older who received SINGULAIR, a decrease in mean peripheral blood eosinophil counts ranging from 9% to 15% was noted, compared with placebo, over the double-blind treatment periods. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280726" conceptname="Seasonal allergic rhinitis">seasonal allergic rhinitis</span> aged 15 years and older who received SINGULAIR, a mean increase of 0.2% in peripheral blood eosinophil counts was noted, compared with a mean increase of 12.5% in placebo-treated patients, over the double-blind treatment periods; this reflects a mean difference of 12.3% in favor of SINGULAIR. The relationship between these observations and the clinical benefits of montelukast noted in the clinical trials is not known (see <a href="#i4i_clinical_studies_id_2b366bcc-8407-40f4-b53e-d68a56ab8390">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies </a>).</p>

<h2>ADULTS AND ADOLESCENTS 15 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical trials in adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older demonstrated there is no additional clinical benefit to montelukast doses above 10 mg once daily.

<p>The efficacy of SINGULAIR for the chronic treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> in adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older was demonstrated in two (U.S. and Multinational) similarly designed, randomized, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in 1576 patients (795 treated with SINGULAIR, 530 treated with placebo, and 251 treated with active control). The patients studied were mild and moderate, non-smoking <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatics</span> who required approximately 5 puffs of inhaled Î²-agonist per day on an â€œas-neededâ€? basis. The patients had a mean baseline percent of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<span class="Sub">1</span>) of 66% (approximate range, 40 to 90%). The co-primary endpoints in these trials were FEV<span class="Sub">1</span> and daytime <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> symptoms. Secondary endpoints included morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates (AM PEFR, PM PEFR), rescue Î²-agonist requirements, nocturnal awakening due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>, and other <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>-related outcomes. In both studies after 12 weeks, a random subset of patients receiving SINGULAIR was switched to placebo for an additional 3 weeks of double-blind treatment to evaluate for possible rebound effects.

<h2>Onset of Action and Maintenance of Benefits</h2>
<p class="First">In each placebo-controlled trial in adults, the treatment effect of SINGULAIR, measured by daily diary card parameters, including symptom scores, â€œas-neededâ€? Î²-agonist use, and PEFR measurements, was achieved after the first dose and was maintained throughout the dosing interval (24 hours). No significant change in treatment effect was observed during continuous once-daily evening administration in non-placebo-controlled extension trials for up to one year. Withdrawal of SINGULAIR in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatic</span> patients after 12 weeks of continuous use did not cause rebound worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>.</p>

<h2>PEDIATRIC PATIENTS 6 TO 14 YEARS OF AGE</h2>
<p class="First">The efficacy of SINGULAIR in pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age was demonstrated in one 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 336 patients (201 treated with SINGULAIR and 135 treated with placebo) using an inhaled Î²-agonist on an â€œas-neededâ€? basis. The patients had a mean baseline percent predicted FEV<span class="Sub">1</span> of 72% (approximate range, 45 to 90%) and a mean daily inhaled Î²-agonist requirement of 3.4 puffs of albuterol. Approximately 36% of the patients were on inhaled corticosteroids.</p>
<p>Compared with placebo, treatment with one 5-mg SINGULAIR chewable tablet daily resulted in a significant improvement in mean morning FEV<span class="Sub">1</span> percent change from baseline (8.7% in the group treated with SINGULAIR vs 4.2% change from baseline in the placebo group, p&lt;0.001). There was a significant decrease in the mean percentage change in daily â€œas-neededâ€? inhaled Î²-agonist use (11.7% decrease from baseline in the group treated with SINGULAIR vs 8.2% increase from baseline in the placebo group, p&lt;0.05). This effect represents a mean decrease from baseline of 0.56 and 0.23 puffs per day for the montelukast and placebo groups, respectively. Subgroup analyses indicated that younger pediatric patients aged 6 to 11 had efficacy results comparable to those of the older pediatric patients aged 12 to 14. </p>
<p>SINGULAIR, one 5-mg chewable tablet daily at bedtime, significantly decreased the percent of days <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> exacerbations occurred (SINGULAIR 20.6% vs placebo 25.7%, pâ‰¤0.05). (See <a href="#id_1ddc54ce-7ec8-4bc2-b509-502282d9cbff">TABLE 2</a> for definition of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> exacerbation.) Parentsâ€™ global <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> evaluations (parental evaluations of the patientsâ€™ <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>, see <a href="#id_1ddc54ce-7ec8-4bc2-b509-502282d9cbff">TABLE 2</a> for definition of score) were significantly better with SINGULAIR compared with placebo (SINGULAIR 1.34 vs placebo 1.69, pâ‰¤0.05).</p>
<p>Similar to the adult studies, no significant change in the treatment effect was observed during continuous once-daily administration in one open-label extension trial without a concurrent placebo group for up to 6 months.</p>

<h2>PEDIATRIC PATIENTS 2 TO 5 YEARS OF AGE</h2>
<p class="First">The efficacy of SINGULAIR for the chronic treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> in pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age was explored in a 12-week, placebo-controlled safety and tolerability study in 689 patients, 461 of whom were treated with SINGULAIR. While the primary objective was to determine the safety and tolerability of SINGULAIR in this age group, the study included exploratory efficacy evaluations, including daytime and overnight <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> symptom scores, Î²-agonist use, oral corticosteroid rescue, and the physicianâ€™s global evaluation. The findings of these exploratory efficacy evaluations, along with pharmacokinetics and extrapolation of efficacy data from older patients, support the overall conclusion that SINGULAIR is efficacious in the maintenance treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> in patients 2 to 5 years of age.</p>

<h2>EFFECTS IN PATIENTS ON CONCOMITANT INHALED CORTICOSTEROIDS</h2>
<p class="First">Separate trials in adults evaluated the ability of SINGULAIR to add to the clinical effect of inhaled corticosteroids and to allow inhaled corticosteroid tapering when used concomitantly. </p>
<p>One randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (n=226) enrolled stable <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatic</span> adults with a mean FEV<span class="Sub">1</span> of approximately 84% of predicted who were previously maintained on various inhaled corticosteroids (delivered by metered-dose aerosol or dry powder inhalers). The types of inhaled corticosteroids and their mean baseline requirements included beclomethasone dipropionate (mean dose, 1203 mcg/day), triamcinolone acetonide (mean dose, 2004 mcg/day), flunisolide (mean dose, 1971 mcg/day), fluticasone propionate (mean dose, 1083 mcg/day), or budesonide (mean dose, 1192 mcg/day). Some of these inhaled corticosteroids were non-U.S.-approved formulations, and doses expressed may not be ex-actuator. The pre-study inhaled corticosteroid requirements were reduced by approximately 37% during a 5- to 7-week placebo run-in period designed to titrate patients toward their lowest effective inhaled corticosteroid dose. Treatment with SINGULAIR resulted in a further 47% reduction in mean inhaled corticosteroid dose compared with a mean reduction of 30% in the placebo group over the 12-week active treatment period (pâ‰¤0.05). Approximately 40% of the montelukast-treated patients and 29% of the placebo-treated patients could be tapered off inhaled corticosteroids and remained off inhaled corticosteroids at the conclusion of the study (p=NS). It is not known whether the results of this study can be generalized to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatics</span> who require higher doses of inhaled corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids. </p>
<p>In another randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (n=642) in a similar population of adult patients previously maintained, but not adequately controlled, on inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone 336 mcg/day), the addition of SINGULAIR to beclomethasone resulted in statistically significant improvements in FEV<span class="Sub">1</span> compared with those patients who were continued on beclomethasone alone or those patients who were withdrawn from beclomethasone and treated with montelukast or placebo alone over the last 10 weeks of the 16-week, blinded treatment period. Patients who were randomized to treatment arms containing beclomethasone had statistically significantly better <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> control than those patients randomized to SINGULAIR alone or placebo alone as indicated by FEV<span class="Sub">1</span>, daytime <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> symptoms, PEFR, nocturnal awakenings due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>, and â€œas-neededâ€? Î²-agonist requirements. </p>
<p>In adult <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatic</span> patients with documented aspirin sensitivity, nearly all of whom were receiving concomitant inhaled and/or oral corticosteroids, a 4-week, randomized, parallel-group trial (n=80) demonstrated that SINGULAIR, compared with placebo, resulted in significant improvement in parameters of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> control. The magnitude of effect of SINGULAIR in aspirin-sensitive patients was similar to the effect observed in the general population of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatic</span> patients studied. The effect of SINGULAIR on the bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatic</span> patients has not been evaluated (see <a href="#i4i_precautions_general_id_f17c6a48-6e00-49a1-b0a5-180427ae0635">PRECAUTIONS, General</a>).</p>

<h2>SINGLE-DOSE ADMINISTRATION (ADULTS AND ADOLESCENTS) </h2>
<p class="First">The efficacy of SINGULAIR, 10 mg, when given as a single dose 2 hours before exercise for the prevention of exercise-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256717" conceptname="Bronchospasm">bronchoconstriction</span> (EIB) was investigated in three (U.S. and Multinational), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies that included a total of 160 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older with exercise-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256717" conceptname="Bronchospasm">bronchoconstriction</span>. Exercise challenge testing was conducted at 2 hours, 8.5 or 12 hours, and 24 hours following administration of a single dose of study drug (SINGULAIR 10 mg or placebo). The primary endpoint was the mean maximum percent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> in FEV<span class="Sub">1</span> following the 2 hours post-dose exercise challenge in all three studies (Study A, Study B, and Study C).

Exercise challenge was conducted at the end of the dosing interval (i.e., 20 to 24 hours after the preceding dose). This effect was maintained throughout the 12-week treatment period indicating that tolerance did not occur. SINGULAIR did not, however, prevent clinically significant deterioration in maximal percent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> in FEV<span class="Sub">1</span> after exercise (i.e., â‰¥20% decrease from pre-exercise baseline) in 52% of patients studied.

<p>In pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age, using the 5-mg chewable tablet, a 2-day crossover study demonstrated effects similar to those observed in adults when exercise challenge was conducted at the end of the dosing interval (i.e., 20 to 24 hours after the preceding dose). </p>

<h2>Clinical Studies â€“ Growth Rate in Pediatric Patients</h2>
<p class="First">A 56-week, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, active- and placebo-controlled parallel group study was conducted to assess the effect of SINGULAIR on growth rate in 360 patients with mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>, aged 6 to 8 years. Treatment groups included SINGULAIR 5 mg once daily, placebo, and beclomethasone dipropionate administered as 168 mcg twice daily with a spacer device. For each subject, a growth rate was defined as the slope of a linear regression line fit to the height measurements over 56 weeks. The primary comparison was the difference in growth rates between SINGULAIR and placebo groups. Growth rates, expressed as least-squares (LS) mean (95% CI) in cm/year, for the SINGULAIR, placebo, and beclomethasone treatment groups were 5.67 (5.46, 5.88), 5.64 (5.42, 5.86), and 4.86 (4.64, 5.08), respectively. The differences in growth rates, expressed as least squares (LS) mean (95% CI) in cm/year, for SINGULAIR minus placebo, beclomethasone minus placebo, and SINGULAIR minus beclomethasone treatment groups were 0.03 (-0.26, 0.31), -0.78 (-1.06, -0.49); and 0.81 (0.53, 1.09), respectively. Growth rate (expressed as mean change in height over time) for each treatment group is shown in Figure 4.</p>

<h2>Clinical Studies â€“ <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280726" conceptname="Seasonal allergic rhinitis">Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis</span></h2>
<p class="First">The efficacy of SINGULAIR tablets for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280726" conceptname="Seasonal allergic rhinitis">seasonal allergic rhinitis</span> was investigated in 5 similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo- and active-controlled (loratadine) trials conducted in North America. The 5 trials enrolled a total of 5029 patients, of whom 1799 were treated with SINGULAIR tablets. Patients were 15 to 82 years of age with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280726" conceptname="Seasonal allergic rhinitis">seasonal allergic rhinitis</span>, a positive skin test to at least one relevant seasonal allergen, and active symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280726" conceptname="Seasonal allergic rhinitis">seasonal allergic rhinitis</span> at study entry. </p>
<p>The period of randomized treatment was 2 weeks in 4 trials and 4 weeks in one trial. The primary outcome variable was mean change from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score (the average of individual scores of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4195085" conceptname="Nasal congestion">nasal congestion</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4170297" conceptname="Sniffles">rhinorrhea</span>, nasal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302654" conceptname="Itching">itching</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4328356" conceptname="Sneezing">sneezing</span>) as assessed by patients on a 0-3 categorical scale. </p>
<p>Four of the five trials showed a significant reduction in daytime nasal symptoms scores with SINGULAIR 10-mg tablets compared with placebo. The efficacy results of one trial are shown below; the remaining three trials that demonstrated efficacy showed similar results. The mean changes from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score in the treatment groups that received SINGULAIR tablets, loratadine and placebo are shown in TABLE 4. </p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">SINGULAIR is not indicated for use in the reversal of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256717" conceptname="Bronchospasm">bronchospasm</span> in acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> attacks, including status asthmaticus. </p>
<p>Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with SINGULAIR can be continued during acute exacerbations of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>. Patients who have exacerbations of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> after exercise should have available for rescue a short-acting inhaled Î²-agonist.</p>
<p>While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, SINGULAIR should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. </p>
<p>Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking SINGULAIR. Although SINGULAIR is effective in improving airway function in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatics</span> with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatic</span> patients (see <a href="#i4i_clinical_studies_id_0dd83a6a-9ad7-4307-a8a7-62853360e114">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies</a>).</p>

The clinical details of some post-marketing reports involving SINGULAIR appear consistent with a drug-induced effect.</p>
<p>Patients and prescribers should be alert for neuropsychiatric events. Patients should be instructed to notify their prescriber if these changes occur. Prescribers should carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment with SINGULAIR if such events occur (see <a href="#i4i_section_id_92e3187a-20b7-472b-9ba0-937bbd0f710e">ADVERSE REACTIONS, Post-Marketing Experience</a>).</p>

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<ul>
<li>Patients should be advised to take SINGULAIR daily as prescribed, even when they are asymptomatic, as well as during periods of worsening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>, and to contact their physicians if their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> is not well controlled. </li>
<li>Patients should be advised that oral SINGULAIR is not for the treatment of acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> attacks. They should have appropriate short-acting inhaled Î²-agonist medication available to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> exacerbations. Patients who have exacerbations of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> after exercise should be instructed to have available for rescue a short-acting inhaled Î²-agonist. Daily administration of SINGULAIR for the chronic treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> has not been established to prevent acute episodes of exercise-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256717" conceptname="Bronchospasm">bronchoconstriction</span>.</li>
<li>Patients should be advised that, while using SINGULAIR, medical attention should be sought if short-acting inhaled bronchodilators are needed more often than usual, or if more than the maximum number of inhalations of short-acting bronchodilator treatment prescribed for a 24-hour period are needed. </li>
<li>Patients receiving SINGULAIR should be instructed not to decrease the dose or stop taking any other anti-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> medications unless instructed by a physician. </li>
<li>Patients should be instructed to notify their physician if neuropsychiatric events occur while using SINGULAIR.</li>
<li>Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should be advised to continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking SINGULAIR.</li>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">SINGULAIR has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug-interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of montelukast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. </p>
<p>Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, SINGULAIR was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines, and decongestants. </p>
<p>Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of montelukast approximately 40% following a single 10-mg dose of montelukast. No dosage adjustment for SINGULAIR is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with SINGULAIR.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">No evidence of tumorigenicity was seen in carcinogenicity studies of either 2 years in Sprague-Dawley rats or 92 weeks in mice at oral gavage doses up to 200 mg/kg/day or 100 mg/kg/day, respectively. The estimated exposure in rats was approximately 120 and 75 times the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) for adults and children, respectively, at the maximum recommended daily oral dose. The estimated exposure in mice was approximately 45 and 25 times the AUC for adults and children, respectively, at the maximum recommended daily oral dose. </p>
<p>Montelukast demonstrated no evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic activity in the following assays: the microbial mutagenesis assay, the V-79 mammalian cell mutagenesis assay, the alkaline elution assay in rat hepatocytes, the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and in the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse bone marrow chromosomal aberration assay. </p>
<p>In fertility studies in female rats, montelukast produced reductions in fertility and fecundity indices at an oral dose of 200 mg/kg (estimated exposure was approximately 70 times the AUC for adults at the maximum recommended daily oral dose). No effects on female fertility or fecundity were observed at an oral dose of 100 mg/kg (estimated exposure was approximately 20 times the AUC for adults at the maximum recommended daily oral dose). Montelukast had no effects on fertility in male rats at oral doses up to 800 mg/kg (estimated exposure was approximately 160 times the AUC for adults at the maximum recommended daily oral dose).</p>

<h2>Pregnancy Category B</h2>
<p class="First">No <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> was observed in rats at oral doses up to 400 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure was approximately 100 times the AUC for adults at the maximum recommended daily oral dose) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 300 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure was approximately 110 times the AUC for adults at the maximum recommended daily oral dose). Montelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, SINGULAIR should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p>
<p>During worldwide marketing experience, congenital <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134741" conceptname="Congenital anomaly of limb">limb defects</span> have been rarely reported in the offspring of women being treated with SINGULAIR during pregnancy. Most of these women were also taking other <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> medications during their pregnancy. A causal relationship between these events and SINGULAIR has not been established.</p>
<p>Merck &amp; Co., Inc. maintains a registry to monitor the pregnancy outcomes of women exposed to SINGULAIR while pregnant. Healthcare providers are encouraged to report any prenatal exposure to SINGULAIR by calling the Pregnancy Registry at (800) 986-8999.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Studies in rats have shown that montelukast is excreted in milk. It is not known if montelukast is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when SINGULAIR is given to a nursing mother.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">No mortality occurred following single oral doses of montelukast up to 5000 mg/kg in mice (estimated exposure was approximately 335 and 210 times the AUC for adults and children, respectively, at the maximum recommended daily oral dose) and rats (estimated exposure was approximately 230 and 145 times the AUC for adults and children, respectively, at the maximum recommended daily oral dose).</p>
<p>No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with SINGULAIR. In chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> studies, montelukast has been administered at doses up to 200 mg/day to adult patients for 22 weeks and, in short-term studies, up to 900 mg/day to patients for approximately a week without clinically important adverse experiences. In the event of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required. </p>
<p>There have been reports of acute overdosage in post-marketing experience and clinical studies with SINGULAIR. These include reports in adults and children with a dose as high as 1000 mg. The clinical and laboratory findings observed were consistent with the safety profile in adults and pediatric patients. There were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports.
