<p>DEPO-MEDROL Sterile Aqueous Suspension contains methylprednisolone acetate which is the 6-methyl derivative of prednisolone. Methylprednisolone acetate is a white or practically white, odorless, crystalline powder which melts at about 215° with some decomposition. It is soluble in dioxane, sparingly soluble in acetone, alcohol, chloroform, and methanol, and slightly soluble in ether. It is practically insoluble in water.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Glucocorticoids, naturally occurring and synthetic, are adrenocortical steroids. </p>
<p>Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone), which also have salt retaining properties, are used in replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Their synthetic analogs are used primarily for their anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems.</p>
<p>Glucocorticoids cause profound and varied metabolic effects. In addition, they modify the body's immune response to diverse stimuli.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Serious neurologic events, some resulting in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>, have been reported with epidural injection of corticosteroids. Specific events reported include, but are not limited to, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4269209" conceptname="Acute infarction of spinal cord">spinal cord infarction</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192606" conceptname="Paraplegia">paraplegia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="374914" conceptname="Tetraplegia">quadriplegia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="253482" conceptname="Cortical blindness">cortical blindness</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>. These serious neurologic events have been reported with and without use of fluoroscopy. The safety and effectiveness of epidural administration of corticosteroids have not been established, and corticosteroids are not approved for this use.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Bold">This product contains benzyl alcohol, which is potentially toxic when administered locally to neural tissue.</span> Exposure to excessive amounts of benzyl alcohol has been associated with toxicity (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span>), particularly in neonates, and an increased incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4326231" conceptname="Kernicterus">kernicterus</span>, particularly in small preterm infants. There have been rare reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span>, primarily in preterm infants, associated with exposure to excessive amounts of benzyl alcohol. The amount of benzyl alcohol in medications is usually considered negligible compared to that received in flush solutions containing benzyl alcohol. Administration of high dosages of medications containing this preservative must take into account the total amount of benzyl alcohol administered. The amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. If the patient requires more than the recommended dosages or other medications containing this preservative, the practitioner must consider the daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from these combined sources (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Pediatric">PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use</a></span>). 								</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Multidose use of DEPO-MEDROL Sterile Aqueous Suspension from a single vial requires special care to avoid contamination. Although initially sterile, any multidose use of vials may lead to contamination unless strict aseptic technique is observed. Particular care, such as use of disposable sterile syringes and needles, is necessary. </span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Injection of DEPO-MEDROL may result in dermal and/or subdermal changes, forming <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressions</span> in the skin at the injection site.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">In order to minimize the incidence of dermal and subdermal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4028206" conceptname="Atrophy">atrophy</span>, care must be exercised not to exceed recommended doses in injections. Multiple small injections into the area of the lesion should be made whenever possible. The technique of intra-articular and intramuscular injection should include precautions against injection or leakage into the dermis. Injection into the deltoid muscle should be avoided because of a high incidence of subcutaneous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4028206" conceptname="Atrophy">atrophy</span>.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">It is critical that, during administration of DEPO-MEDROL, appropriate technique be used and care taken to ensure proper placement of drug.</span></p>
<p>Rare instances of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4148381" conceptname="Anaphylactoid reaction">anaphylactoid reactions</span> have occurred in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy. </p>
<p>Increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids is indicated in patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to any unusual stress before, during, or after the stressful situation (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#AR">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span>). </p>
<p>Results from one multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study with methylprednisolone hemisuccinate, an IV corticosteroid, showed an increase in early (at 2 weeks) and late (at 6 months) mortality in patients with cranial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433633" conceptname="Late effect of superficial injury">trauma</span> who were determined not to have other clear indications for corticosteroid treatment. High doses of systemic corticosteroids, including DEPO-MEDROL, should not be used for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437409" conceptname="Intracranial injury">traumatic brain injury</span>.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Average and large doses of corticosteroids can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4125002" conceptname="Idiopathic fluid retention">water retention</span>, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. </p>
<p>Literature reports suggest an apparent association between the use of corticosteroids and left ventricular free wall rupture after a recent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>; therefore, therapy with corticosteroids should be used with great caution in these patients.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span>: Monitor patients for these conditions with chronic use.</p>
<p>Corticosteroids can produce reversible HPA axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Drug induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4042063" conceptname="Hypocortisolism secondary to another disorder">secondary adrenocortical insufficiency</span> may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Persons who are on corticosteroids are more susceptible to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> than are healthy individuals. There may be decreased resistance and inability to localize <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> when corticosteroids are used. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">Infections</span> with any pathogen (viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic) in any location of the body may be associated with the use of corticosteroids alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents.</p>
<p>These <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> may be mild, but can be severe and at times fatal. With increasing doses of corticosteroids, the rate of occurrence of infectious complications increases. Corticosteroids may mask some signs of current <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>. Do not use intra-articularly, intrabursally, or for intratendinous administration for local effect in the presence of acute local <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Corticosteroids may exacerbate systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432248" conceptname="Opportunistic mycosis">fungal infections</span> and therefore should not be used in the presence of such <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> unless they are needed to control drug reactions. There have been cases reported in which concomitant use of amphotericin B and hydrocortisone was followed by cardiac enlargement and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Contra">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#Amphotericin_B">PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions, Amphotericin B injection and potassium-depleting agents</a></span>).</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Latent disease may be activated or there may be an exacerbation of intercurrent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> due to pathogens, including those caused by <span class="Italics">Amoeba</span>, <span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433968" conceptname="Candidiasis">Candida</span>, Cryptococcus, Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Pneumocystis, and Toxoplasma.</span></p>
<p>It is recommended that latent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438959" conceptname="Amebic infection">amebiasis</span> or active <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438959" conceptname="Amebic infection">amebiasis</span> be ruled out before initiating corticosteroid therapy in any patient who has spent time in the tropics or in any patient with unexplained <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>.</p>
<p>Similarly, corticosteroids should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected <span class="Italics">Strongyloides</span> (threadworm) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432251" conceptname="Disease caused by parasite">infestation</span>.

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>When multidose vials are used, special care to prevent contamination of the contents is essential. A povidone-iodine solution or similar product is recommended to cleanse the vial top prior to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span> of contents. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#Warnings">WARNINGS</a></span>.)</p>
<p>This product, like many other steroid formulations, is sensitive to heat. Therefore, it should not be autoclaved when it is desirable to sterilize the outside of the vial. </p>
<p>The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment. When reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual.</p>
<p>Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used.</p>
<p>Kaposi's <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084784" conceptname="Sarcoma">sarcoma</span> has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions.  Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement.</p>

</p>
<p></p>
<p>Drug-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4042063" conceptname="Hypocortisolism secondary to another disorder">secondary adrenocortical insufficiency</span> may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently.</p>
<p>Metabolic clearance of corticosteroids is decreased in hypothyroid patients and increased in hyperthyroid patients. Changes in thyroid status of the patient may necessitate adjustment in dosage. </p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Steroids should be used with caution in active or latent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4027663" conceptname="Peptic ulcer">peptic ulcers</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4109737" conceptname="Diverticulitis">diverticulitis</span>, fresh intestinal anastomoses, and non-specific <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="81893" conceptname="Ulcerative colitis">ulcerative colitis</span>, since they may increase the risk of a perforation.</p>
<p>Signs of peritoneal irritation following <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4202064" conceptname="Gastrointestinal perforation">gastrointestinal perforation</span> in patients receiving corticosteroids may be minimal or absent.</p>
<p>There is an enhanced effect due to decreased metabolism of corticosteroids in patients with cirrhosis.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Intra-articular injected corticosteroids may be systemically absorbed. </p>
<p>Appropriate examination of any joint fluid is necessary to exclude a septic process. </p>

If this complication occurs and the diagnosis of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="132797" conceptname="Sepsis">sepsis</span> is confirmed, appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be instituted.</p>
<p>Injection of a steroid into an infected site is to be avoided. Local injection of a steroid into a previously infected joint is not usually recommended.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Corticosteroids decrease bone formation and increase bone resorption both through their effect on calcium regulation (e.g., decreasing absorption and increasing excretion) and inhibition of osteoblast function. This, together with a decrease in the protein matrix of the bone secondary to an increase in protein catabolism, and reduced sex hormone production, may lead to inhibition of bone growth in pediatric patients and the development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> at any age. Special consideration should be given to patients at increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> (i.e., postmenopausal women) before initiating corticosteroid therapy. </p>
<p>

<p></p>
<p>Although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="374919" conceptname="Multiple sclerosis">multiple sclerosis</span>, they do not show that corticosteroids affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease. The studies do show that relatively high doses of corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#Dosage">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>.)</p>
<p>An <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4102023" conceptname="Proximal myopathy">acute myopathy</span> has been observed with the use of high doses of corticosteroids, most often occurring in patients with disorders of neuromuscular transmission (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="76685" conceptname="Myasthenia gravis">myasthenia gravis</span>), or in patients receiving concomitant therapy with neuromuscular blocking drugs (e.g., pancuronium). This <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4102023" conceptname="Proximal myopathy">acute myopathy</span> is generalized, may involve ocular and respiratory muscles, and may result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="444419" conceptname="Tetraparesis">quadriparesis</span>. Elevation of creatine kinase may occur. Clinical improvement or recovery after stopping corticosteroids may require weeks to years.</p>
<p>Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142453" conceptname="Feeling high">euphoria</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4078201" conceptname="Mood swings">mood swings</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="444092" conceptname="Personality change">personality changes</span>, and severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> to frank <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychotic</span> manifestations.

<p>Intraocular pressure may become elevated in some individuals. If steroid therapy is continued for more than 6 weeks, intraocular pressure should be monitored.</p>
<p>Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029621" conceptname="Fear">fear</span> of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4326414" conceptname="Perforation of cornea">corneal perforation</span>.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Patients should be warned not to discontinue the use of corticosteroids abruptly or without medical supervision, to advise any medical attendants that they are taking corticosteroids, and to seek medical advice at once should they develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span> or other signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>.</p>
<p>Persons who are on corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chicken pox or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030555" conceptname="Measles">measles</span>. Patients should also be advised that if they are exposed, medical advice should be sought without delay.</p>

<p>Aminoglutethimide may lead to a loss of corticosteroid-induced adrenal suppression.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>When corticosteroids are administered concomitantly with potassium-depleting agents (e.g., amphotericin B, diuretics), patients should be observed closely for development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>.

<p>Macrolide antibiotics have been reported to cause a significant decrease in corticosteroid clearance (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Hepatic_Enzyme">PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions, Hepatic Enzyme Inhibitors</a></span>).</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Concomitant use of anticholinesterase agents and corticosteroids may produce severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">weakness</span> in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="76685" conceptname="Myasthenia gravis">myasthenia gravis</span>. If possible, anticholinesterase agents should be withdrawn at least 24 hours before initiating corticosteroid therapy.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Coadministration of corticosteroids and warfarin usually results in inhibition of response to warfarin, although there have been some conflicting reports. Therefore, coagulation indices should be monitored frequently to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Because corticosteroids may increase blood glucose concentrations, dosage adjustments of antidiabetic agents may be required.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Serum concentrations of isoniazid may be decreased.</p>

<p>Estrogens may decrease the hepatic metabolism of certain corticosteroids, thereby increasing their effect.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Drugs which induce cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme activity may enhance the metabolism of corticosteroids and require that the dosage of the corticosteroid be increased.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Drugs which inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 have the potential to result in increased plasma concentrations of corticosteroids. </p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ketoconazole has been reported to significantly decrease the metabolism of certain corticosteroids by up to 60%, leading to an increased risk of corticosteroid side effects.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Concomitant use of aspirin (or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents) and corticosteroids increases the risk of gastrointestinal side effects. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with concurrent use of corticosteroids in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4253058" conceptname="Factor II deficiency">hypoprothrombinemia</span>. The clearance of salicylates may be increased with concurrent use of corticosteroids. </p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Corticosteroids may suppress reactions to skin tests.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy may exhibit a diminished response to toxoids and live or attenuated vaccines due to inhibition of antibody response. Corticosteroids may also potentiate the replication of some organisms contained in live attenuated vaccines. Routine administration of vaccines or toxoids should be deferred until corticosteroid therapy is discontinued if possible (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Vaccinations">WARNINGS: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">Infections</span>, Vaccinations</a></span>).</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>No adequate studies have been conducted in animals to determine whether corticosteroids have a potential for carcinogenesis or mutagenesis. Steroids may increase or decrease motility and number of spermatozoa in some patients.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in many species when given in doses equivalent to the human dose. Animal studies in which corticosteroids have been given to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits have yielded an increased incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135923" conceptname="Cleft palate">cleft palate</span> in the offspring. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born to mothers who have received corticosteroids during pregnancy should be carefully observed for signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="193984" conceptname="Adrenal hypofunction">hypoadrenalism</span>.</p>

<p>Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from corticosteroids, a decision should be made whether to continue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<p>This product contains benzyl alcohol as a preservative. Benzyl alcohol, a component of this product, has been associated with serious adverse events and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>, particularly in pediatric patients. The "<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">gasping</span> syndrome" (characterized by central nervous system <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">gasping</span> respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites found in the blood and urine) has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages &gt;99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low-birth-weight neonates. Additional symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439847" conceptname="Intracranial hemorrhage">intracranial hemorrhage</span>, hematologic abnormalities, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140842" conceptname="Changes in skin texture">skin breakdown</span>, hepatic and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443240" conceptname="Collapse">cardiovascular collapse</span>. Although normal therapeutic doses of this product ordinarily delivers amounts of benzyl alcohol that are substantially lower than those reported in association with the "<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">gasping</span> syndrome", the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. The risk of benzyl alcohol toxicity depends on the quantity administered and the hepatic capacity to detoxify the chemical. Premature and low-birth-weight infants, as well as patients receiving high dosages, may be more likely to develop toxicity. Practitioners administering this and other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources.</p>
<p>The efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in the pediatric population are based on the well-established course of effect of corticosteroids, which is similar in pediatric and adult populations. Published studies provide evidence of efficacy and safety in pediatric patients for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4298809" conceptname="Nephritic syndrome">nephritic syndrome</span> (patients &gt;2 years of age) and aggressive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphomas</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315497" conceptname="Subacute leukemia">leukemias</span> (patients &gt;1 month of age). Other indications for pediatric use of corticosteroids (e.g., severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314754" conceptname="Wheezing">wheezing</span>) are based on adequate and well-controlled clinical trials conducted in adults, on the premises that the course of the diseases and their pathophysiology are considered to be substantially similar in both populations. </p>
<p>The adverse effects of corticosteroids in pediatric patients are similar to those in adults (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#AR">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span>). Like adults, pediatric patients should be carefully observed with frequent measurements of blood pressure, weight, height, intraocular pressure, and clinical evaluation for the presence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, psychosocial disturbances, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4159647" conceptname="Thromboembolic disorder">thromboembolism</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4027663" conceptname="Peptic ulcer">peptic ulcers</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">cataracts</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span>. Pediatric patients who are treated with corticosteroids by any route, including systemically administered corticosteroids, may experience a decrease in their growth velocity. This negative impact of corticosteroids on growth has been observed at low systemic doses and in the absence of laboratory evidence of HPA axis suppression (i.e., cosyntropin stimulation and basal cortisol plasma levels). Growth velocity may therefore be a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The linear growth of pediatric patients treated with corticosteroids should be monitored, and the potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against clinical benefits obtained and the availability of treatment alternatives. In order to minimize the potential growth effects of corticosteroids, pediatric patients should be titrated to the lowest effective dose.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. </p>

<p><span class="Bold">Because of possible physical incompatibilities, DEPO-MEDROL Sterile Aqueous Suspension should not be diluted or mixed with other solutions.</span></p>
<p>The initial dosage of parenterally administered DEPO-MEDROL will vary from 4 to 120 mg depending on the specific disease entity being treated. However, in certain overwhelming, acute, life-threatening situations, administration in dosages exceeding the usual dosages may be justified and may be in multiples of the oral dosages. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">It Should Be Emphasized that Dosage Requirements Are Variable and Must Be Individualized on the Basis of the Disease Under Treatment and the Response of the Patient.</span>  After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. Situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In this latter situation, it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the corticosteroid for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.</p>

<p>Therapy with DEPO-MEDROL does not obviate the need for the conventional measures usually employed.

<p>The dose for intra-articular administration depends upon the size of the joint and varies with the severity of the condition in the individual patient. In chronic cases, injections may be repeated at intervals ranging from one to five or more weeks, depending upon the degree of relief obtained from the initial injection. The doses in the following table are given as a general guide:</p>

<p>It is recommended that the anatomy of the joint involved be reviewed before attempting intra-articular injection. In order to obtain the full anti-inflammatory effect, it is important that the injection be made into the synovial space. Employing the same sterile technique as for a lumbar puncture, a sterile 20 to 24 gauge needle (on a dry syringe) is quickly inserted into the synovial cavity. Procaine infiltration is elective. The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span> of only a few drops of joint fluid proves the joint space has been entered by the needle. <span class="Italics">The injection site for each joint is determined by that location where the synovial cavity is most superficial and most free of large vessels and nerves. </span>With the needle in place, the aspirating syringe is removed and replaced by a second syringe containing the desired amount of DEPO-MEDROL. The plunger is then pulled outward slightly to aspirate synovial fluid and to make sure the needle is still in the synovial space. After injection, the joint is moved gently a few times to aid mixing of the synovial fluid and the suspension. The site is covered with a small sterile dressing.</p>
<p>Suitable sites for intra-articular injection are the knee, ankle, wrist, elbow, shoulder, phalangeal, and hip joints. Since difficulty is not infrequently encountered in entering the hip joint, precautions should be taken to avoid any large blood vessels in the area. Joints not suitable for injection are those that are anatomically inaccessible such as the spinal joints and those like the sacroiliac joints that are devoid of synovial space. Treatment failures are most frequently the result of failure to enter the joint space. Little or no benefit follows injection into surrounding tissue. If failures occur when injections into the synovial spaces are certain, as determined by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span> of fluid, repeated injections are usually futile. </p>
<p>If a local anesthetic is used prior to injection of DEPO-MEDROL, the anesthetic package insert should be read carefully and all the precautions observed.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The area around the injection site is prepared in a sterile way and a wheal at the site made with 1 percent procaine hydrochloride solution. A 20 to 24 gauge needle attached to a dry syringe is inserted into the bursa and the fluid aspirated. The needle is left in place and the aspirating syringe changed for a small syringe containing the desired dose. After injection, the needle is withdrawn and a small dressing applied.</p>
<p>

<p>In the treatment of conditions such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77081" conceptname="Tibialis tendinitis">tendinitis</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4195698" conceptname="Tenosynovitis">tenosynovitis</span>, care should be taken following application of a suitable antiseptic to the overlying skin to inject the suspension into the tendon sheath rather than into the substance of the tendon. The tendon may be readily palpated when placed on a stretch. When treating conditions such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4249170" conceptname="Epicondylitis">epicondylitis</span>, the area of greatest <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4082445" conceptname="Tenderness">tenderness</span> should be outlined carefully and the suspension infiltrated into the area. For ganglia of the tendon sheaths, the suspension is injected directly into the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4209224" conceptname="Cyst">cyst</span>. In many cases, a single injection causes a marked decrease in the size of the cystic tumor and may effect disappearance. The usual sterile precautions should be observed, of course, with each injection.</p>
<p>The dose in the treatment of the various conditions of the tendinous or bursal structures listed above varies with the condition being treated and ranges from 4 to 30 mg. In recurrent or chronic conditions, repeated injections may be necessary.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Following cleansing with an appropriate antiseptic such as 70% alcohol, 20 to 60 mg of the suspension is injected into the lesion. It may be necessary to distribute doses ranging from 20 to 40 mg by repeated local injections in the case of large lesions. Care should be taken to avoid injection of sufficient material to cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260836" conceptname="Blanching of skin">blanching</span> since this may be followed by a small slough. One to four injections are usually employed, the intervals between injections varying with the type of lesion being treated and the duration of improvement produced by the initial injection.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">When multidose vials are used, special care to prevent contamination of the contents is essential. (See <a href="#Warnings">WARNINGS</a>.)</span></p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The intramuscular dosage will vary with the condition being treated. When employed as a temporary substitute for oral therapy, a single injection during each 24-hour period of a dose of the suspension equal to the total daily oral dose of MEDROL<span class="Sup">®</span> Tablets (methylprednisolone tablets, USP) is usually sufficient. When a prolonged effect is desired, the weekly dose may be calculated by multiplying the daily oral dose by 7 and given as a single intramuscular injection.</p>
<p>In pediatric patients, the initial dose of methylprednisolone may vary depending upon the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.11 to 1.6 mg/kg/day. Dosage must be individualized according to the severity of the disease and response of the patient. </p>
<p>In patients with the <span class="Bold">adrenogenital syndrome, </span>a single intramuscular injection of 40 mg every two weeks may be adequate. For maintenance of patients with <span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span></span>, the weekly intramuscular dose will vary from 40 to 120 mg. The usual dosage for patients with <span class="Bold">dermatologic lesions </span>benefited by systemic corticoid therapy is 40 to 120 mg of methylprednisolone acetate administered intramuscularly at weekly intervals for one to four weeks. In acute severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133835" conceptname="Eczema">dermatitis</span> due to poison ivy, relief may result within 8 to 12 hours following intramuscular administration of a single dose of 80 to 120 mg. In chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134438" conceptname="Contact dermatitis">contact dermatitis</span>, repeated injections at 5 to 10 day intervals may be necessary. In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137053" conceptname="Seborrheic dermatitis">seborrheic dermatitis</span>, a weekly dose of 80 mg may be adequate to control the condition.</p>
<p>Following intramuscular administration of 80 to 120 mg to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatic</span> patients, relief may result within 6 to 48 hours and persist for several days to two weeks. Similarly, in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="257007" conceptname="Allergic rhinitis">allergic rhinitis</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256439" conceptname="Allergic rhinitis due to pollen">hay fever</span>), an intramuscular dose of 80 to 120 mg may be followed by relief of coryzal symptoms within six hours persisting for several days to three weeks.</p>
<p>If signs of stress are associated with the condition being treated, the dosage of the suspension should be increased. If a rapid hormonal effect of maximum intensity is required, the intravenous administration of highly soluble methylprednisolone sodium succinate is indicated.</p>
<p>In treatment of acute exacerbations of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="374919" conceptname="Multiple sclerosis">multiple sclerosis</span>, daily doses of 160 mg of methylprednisolone for a week followed by 64 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective.</p>
