<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Mefloquine hydrochloride is an antimalarial agent available as 
250 mg tablets of mefloquine hydrochloride (equivalent to 228.0 mg of the free 
base) for oral administration.</p>
<p>Mefloquine hydrochloride is a 4-quinolinemethanol derivative with the 
specific chemical name of (R*, S*)-(±)-α-2-piperidinyl-2,8-bis 
(trifluoromethyl)-4-quinolinemethanol hydrochloride. It is a 2-aryl substituted 
chemical structural analog of quinine. The drug is a white to almost white 
crystalline compound, slightly soluble in water.</p>Mefloquine hydrochloride has a calculated molecular weight of 414.78 and the 
following structural formula:<div class="Figure"><img alt="image of Mefloquine hydrochloride chemical structure" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=1c47fd79-c0ca-42d6-9910-774272b25bc1&amp;name=Mefloquine%20Hcl%20chemical%20structure.jpg"></div>
<p>The inactive ingredients are crospovidone, lactose monohydrate, low-substituted 
hydroxypropyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, 
pregelatinized starch and talc.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<a href="http://"></a>Pharmacokinetics<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Absorption<p class="First">The absolute oral bioavailability of mefloquine has not been 
determined since an intravenous formulation is not available. The 
bioavailability of the tablet formation compared with an oral solution was over 
85%. The presence of food significantly enhances the rate and extent of 
absorption, leading to about a 40% increase in bioavailability. In healthy 
volunteers, plasma concentrations peak 6 to 24 hours (median, about 17 hours) 
after a single dose of mefloquine. In a similar group of volunteers, maximum 
plasma concentrations in mcg/L are roughly equivalent to the dose in milligrams 
(for example, a single 1000 mg dose produces a maximum concentration of about 
1000 mcg/L). In healthy volunteers, a dose of 250 mg once weekly produces 
maximum steady-state plasma concentrations of 1000 to 2000 mcg/L, which are 
reached after 7 to 10 weeks.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Distribution<p>In healthy adults, the apparent volume of distribution is 
approximately 20 L/kg, indicating extensive tissue distribution. Mefloquine may 
accumulate in parasitized erythrocytes. Experiments conducted <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> with human blood using concentrations between 50 
and 1000 mg/mL showed a relatively constant erythrocyte-to-plasma concentration 
ratio of about 2 to 1. The equilibrium reached in less than 30 minutes was found 
to be reversible. Protein binding is about 98%.</p>
<p>Mefloquine crosses the placenta. Excretion into breast milk appears to be 
minimal (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_nursing_mothers_id_prec-nursmo">PRECAUTIONS: Nursing 
Mothers</a></span>).</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Metabolism<p>Mefloquine is extensively metabolized in the liver by the 
cytochrome P450 system. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> studies strongly suggested that CYP3A4 is the major 
isoform involved.</p>
<p>Two metabolites of mefloquine have been identified in humans. The main 
metabolite, 2,8-<span class="Italics">bis</span>-trifluoromethyl-4-quinoline 
carboxylic acid, is inactive in <span class="Italics">Plasmodium 
falciparum</span>. In a study in healthy volunteers, the carboxylic acid 
metabolite appeared in plasma 2 to 4 hours after a single oral dose. Maximum 
plasma concentrations of the metabolite, which were about 50% higher than those 
of mefloquine, were reached after 2 weeks. Thereafter, plasma levels of the main 
metabolite and mefloquine declined at a similar rate. The area under the plasma 
concentration-time curve (AUC) of the main metabolite was 3 to 5 times larger 
than that of the parent drug. The other metabolite, an alcohol, was present in 
minute quantities only.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Elimination<p>In several studies in healthy adults, the mean elimination 
half-life of mefloquine varied between 2 and 4 weeks, with an average of about 3 
weeks. Total clearance, which is essentially hepatic, is in the order of 30 
mL/min. There is evidence that mefloquine is excreted mainly in the bile and 
feces. In volunteers, urinary excretion of unchanged mefloquine and its main 
metabolite under steady-state condition accounted for about 9% and 4% of the 
dose, respectively. Concentrations of other metabolites could not be measured in 
the urine.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pharmacokinetics in Special Clinical 
Situations<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Children and the Elderly<p>No relevant age-related changes have been observed in the 
pharmacokinetics of mefloquine. Therefore, the dosage for children has been 
extrapolated from the recommended adult dose.</p>
<p>No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in patients with renal 
insufficiency since only a small proportion of the drug is eliminated renally. 
Mefloquine and its main metabolite are not appreciably removed by hemodialysis. 
No special chemoprophylactic dosage adjustments are indicated for dialysis 
patients to achieve concentrations in plasma similar to those in healthy 
persons.</p>
<p>Although clearance of mefloquine may increase in late pregnancy, in general, 
pregnancy has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of 
mefloquine.</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of mefloquine may be altered in acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438067" conceptname="Malaria">malaria</span>.</p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic differences have been observed between various ethnic 
populations. In practice, however, these are of minor importance compared with 
host immune status and sensitivity of the parasite.</p>
<p>During long-term prophylaxis (&gt;2 years), the trough concentrations and the 
elimination half-life of mefloquine were similar to those obtained in the same 
population after 6 months of drug use, which is when they reached steady 
state.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> 
studies showed no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126829" conceptname="Hemolysis">hemolysis</span> associated with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Microbiology<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Mechanism of Action<p>Mefloquine is an antimalarial agent which acts as a blood 
schizonticide. Its exact mechanism of action is not known.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Activity In Vitro and In Vivo<p>Mefloquine is active against the erythrocytic stages of <span class="Italics">Plasmodium</span> species (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_indications_id_ind-usg">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</a></span>). However, 
the drug has no effect against the exoerythrocytic (hepatic) stages of the 
parasite. Mefloquine is effective against <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438067" conceptname="Malaria">malaria</span> parasites resistant to 
chloroquine (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_indications_id_ind-usg">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</a></span>).</p>

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Drug Interactions<p>Drug-drug interactions with mefloquine have not been explored in 
detail. There is one report of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4256374" conceptname="Cardiorespiratory arrest">cardiopulmonary arrest</span>, with full recovery, in a 
patient who was taking a beta blocker (propranolol) (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_section_id_9f5baf22-4e2f-4fa0-8bde-ee9d5f9295c7">PRECAUTIONS: Cardiac 
Effects</a></span>). The effects of mefloquine on the compromised cardiovascular 
system have not been evaluated. The benefits of mefloquine therapy should be 
weighed against the possibility of adverse effects in patients with cardiac 
disease.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Halofantrine and Other Antimalarials<p>Halofantrine should not be administered with mefloquine or within 
15 weeks of the last dose of mefloquine due to the risk of a potentially fatal 
prolongation of the QTc interval (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_warnings_id_warn">WARNINGS</a></span>).</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of mefloquine and other related antimalarial 
compounds (eg, quinine, quinidine and chloroquine) may produce 
electrocardiographic abnormalities and increase the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> (see 
<span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_warnings_id_warn">WARNINGS</a></span>). If these 
drugs are to be used in the initial treatment of severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438067" conceptname="Malaria">malaria</span>, mefloquine 
administration should be delayed at least 12 hours after the last dose. 
Clinically significant QTc prolongation has not been found with mefloquine 
alone.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Ketoconazole (Potent Inhibitor of CYP3A4)<p>Co-administration of a single 500 mg oral dose of mefloquine with 
400 mg of ketoconazole once daily for 10 days in 8 healthy volunteers resulted 
in an increase in the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of mefloquine by 
64% and 79%, respectively, and an increase in the mean elimination half-life of 
mefloquine from 322 hours to 448 hours. Ketoconazole should not be administered 
with mefloquine or within 15 weeks of the last dose of mefloquine due to the 
risk of a potentially fatal prolongation of the QTc interval (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Other Drugs that Prolong the QTc Interval<p>Co-administration of other drugs known to alter cardiac 
conduction (eg, anti-arrhythmic or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium 
channel blockers, antihistamines or H<span class="Sub">1</span>-blocking agents, 
tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines) might also contribute to a 
prolongation of the QTc interval. There are no data that conclusively establish 
whether the concomitant administration of mefloquine and the above listed agents 
has an effect on cardiac function.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Anticonvulsants<p>In patients taking an anticonvulsant (eg, valproic acid, 
carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin), the concomitant use of mefloquine 
may reduce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> control by lowering the plasma levels of the anticonvulsant. 
Therefore, patients concurrently taking antiseizure medication and mefloquine 
should have the blood level of their antiseizure medication monitored and the 
dosage adjusted appropriately (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_precautions_id_prec">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>).</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Vaccines<p>When mefloquine is taken concurrently with oral live <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192819" conceptname="Typhoid fever">typhoid</span> 
vaccines, attenuation of immunization cannot be excluded. Vaccinations with 
attenuated live bacteria should therefore be completed at least 3 days before 
the first dose of mefloquine hydrochloride tablets.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Rifampin (Potent Inducer of CYP3A4)<p>Co-administration of a single 500 mg oral dose of mefloquine and 
600 mg of rifampin once daily for 7 days in 7 healthy Thai volunteers resulted 
in a decrease in the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of mefloquine by 
19% and 68%, respectively, and a decrease in the mean elimination half-life of 
mefloquine from 305 hours to 113 hours. Rifampin should be used cautiously in 
patients taking mefloquine.</p>
<br><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP3A4<p>Mefloquine does not inhibit or induce the CYP 450 enzyme system. 
Thus, concomitant administration of mefloquine and substrates of the CYP 450 
enzyme system is not expected to result in a drug interaction. However, 
co-administration of CYP 450 inhibitors or inducers may increase or decrease 
mefloquine plasma concentrations, respectively.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Substrates and Inhibitors of P-glycoprotein<p>It has been shown <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> that 
mefloquine is a substrate and an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. Therefore, 
drug-drug interactions could also occur with drugs that are substrates or are 
known to modify the expression of this transporter. The clinical relevance of 
these interactions is not known to date.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Other Potential Interactions<p>No other drug interactions are known. Nevertheless, the effects 
of mefloquine on travelers receiving comedication, particularly diabetics or 
patients using anticoagulants, should be checked before departure.</p>
<p>In clinical trials, the concomitant administration of sulfadoxine and 
pyrimethamine did not alter the adverse reaction profile of mefloquine.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of 
Fertility<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Carcinogenesis<p>The carcinogenic potential of mefloquine was studied in rats and 
mice in 2-year feeding studies at doses of up to 30 mg/kg/day. No 
treatment-related increases in tumors of any type were noted.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Mutagenesis<p>The mutagenic potential of mefloquine was studied in a variety of 
assay systems including: Ames test, a host-mediated assay in mice, fluctuation 
tests and a mouse micronucleus assay. Several of these assays were performed 
with and without prior metabolic activation. In no instance was evidence 
obtained for the mutagenicity of mefloquine.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Impairment of Fertility<p>Fertility studies in rats at doses of 5, 20, and 50 mg/kg/day of 
mefloquine have demonstrated adverse effects on fertility in the male at the 
high dose of 50 mg/kg/day, and in the female at doses of 20 and 50 mg/kg/day. 
Histopathological lesions were noted in the epididymides from male rats at doses 
of 20 and 50 mg/kg/day. Administration of 250 mg/week of mefloquine (base) in 
adult males for 22 weeks failed to reveal any deleterious effects on human 
spermatozoa.</p>
<br><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pregnancy<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Teratogenic Effects<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pregnancy Category C<p>Mefloquine has been demonstrated to be teratogenic in rats and 
mice at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day. In rabbits, a high dose of 160 mg/kg/day was 
embryotoxic and teratogenic, and a dose of 80 mg/kg/day was teratogenic but not 
embryotoxic. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant 
women. However, clinical experience with mefloquine has not revealed an 
embryotoxic or teratogenic effect. Mefloquine should be used during pregnancy 
only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Women 
of childbearing potential who are traveling to areas where <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438067" conceptname="Malaria">malaria</span> is endemic 
should be warned against becoming pregnant. Women of childbearing potential 
should also be advised to practice contraception during <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438067" conceptname="Malaria">malaria</span> prophylaxis with 
mefloquine and for up to 3 months thereafter. However, in the case of unplanned 
pregnancy, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438067" conceptname="Malaria">malaria</span> chemoprophylaxis with mefloquine is not considered an 
indication for pregnancy termination.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Nursing Mothers<p>Mefloquine is excreted in human milk in small amounts, the 
activity of which is unknown. Based on a study in a few subjects, low 
concentrations (3% to 4%) of mefloquine were excreted in human milk following a 
dose equivalent to 250 mg of the free base. Because of the potential for serious 
adverse reactions in nursing infants from mefloquine, a decision should be made 
whether to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug 
to the mother.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pediatric Use<p>Use of mefloquine to treat acute, uncomplicated <span class="Italics">P. falciparum</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438067" conceptname="Malaria">malaria</span> in pediatric patients is supported by 
evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of mefloquine in adults with 
additional data from published open-label and comparative trials using 
mefloquine to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438067" conceptname="Malaria">malaria</span> caused by <span class="Italics">P. falciparum</span> 
in patients younger than 16 years of age. The safety and effectiveness of 
mefloquine for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438067" conceptname="Malaria">malaria</span> in pediatric patients below the age of 6 
months have not been established.</p>
<p>In several studies, the administration of mefloquine for the treatment of 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438067" conceptname="Malaria">malaria</span> was associated with early <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> in pediatric patients. Early <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> 
was cited in some reports as a possible cause of treatment failure. If a second 
dose is not tolerated, the patient should be monitored closely and alternative 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438067" conceptname="Malaria">malaria</span> treatment considered if improvement is not observed within a reasonable 
period of time (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_dos-admin">DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Geriatric Use<p>Clinical studies of mefloquine did not include sufficient numbers 
of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from 
younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified 
differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. Since 
electrocardiographic abnormalities have been observed in individuals treated 
with mefloquine (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_precautions_id_prec">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>) and underlying cardiac 
disease is more prevalent in elderly than in younger patients, the benefits of 
mefloquine therapy should be weighed against the possibility of adverse cardiac 
effects in elderly patients.</p>

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Postmarketing<p>Postmarketing surveillance indicates that the same kind of 
adverse experiences are reported during prophylaxis, as well as acute treatment. 
Because these experiences are reported voluntarily from a population of

single oral dose. The drug should not be taken on an empty stomach and should be 
administered with at least 8 oz (240 mL) of water.</p>
<p>If a full-treatment course with mefloquine does not lead to improvement 
within 48 to 72 hours, mefloquine should not be used for retreatment. An 
alternative therapy should be used. Similarly, if previous prophylaxis with 
mefloquine has failed, mefloquine should not be used for curative treatment.</p>  
<span class="Italics">Note:</span> Patients with acute <span class="Italics">P. 
vivax</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438067" conceptname="Malaria">malaria</span>, treated with mefloquine, are at high risk of relapse 
because mefloquine does not eliminate exoerythrocytic (hepatic phase) parasites. 
To avoid relapse after initial treatment of the acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> with mefloquine, 
patients should subsequently be treated with an 8-aminoquinoline derivative (eg,

<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118659" conceptname="Prophylactic">Prophylactic</span> drug administration should begin 1 week before arrival in an 
endemic area. Subsequent weekly doses should be taken regularly, always on the 
same day of each week, preferably after the main meal. To reduce the risk of 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438067" conceptname="Malaria">malaria</span> after leaving an endemic area, prophylaxis must be continued for 4 
additional weeks to ensure suppressive blood levels of the drug when merozoites 
emerge from the liver. Tablets should not be taken on an empty stomach and 
should be administered with at least 8 oz (240 mL) of water.</p>
<p>In certain cases, eg, when a traveler is taking other medication, it may be 
desirable to start prophylaxis 2 to 3 weeks prior to departure, in order to 
ensure that the combination of drugs is well tolerated (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_drug_interaction_id_69edbdd8-25df-4f78-9457-dfcd77bfde6f">PRECAUTIONS: 
Drug Interactions</a></span>).</p>
<p>When prophylaxis with mefloquine fails, physicians should carefully evaluate 
which antimalarial to use for therapy.</p>

therapeutic dose into 2 doses taken 6 to 8 hours apart may reduce the occurrence 
or severity of adverse effects. Experience with mefloquine in pediatric patients 
weighing less than 20 kg is limited. The drug should not be taken on an empty 
stomach and should be administered with ample water. The tablets may be crushed 
and suspended in a small amount of water, milk or other beverage for 
administration to small children and other persons unable to swallow them 
whole.</p>
<p>If a full-treatment course with mefloquine does not lead to improvement 
within 48 to 72 hours, mefloquine should not be used for retreatment. An 
alternative therapy should be used. Similarly, if previous prophylaxis with 
mefloquine has failed, mefloquine should not be used for curative treatment.</p>
<p>In pediatric patients, the administration of mefloquine for the treatment of 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438067" conceptname="Malaria">malaria</span> has been associated with early <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>. In some cases, early <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> 
has been cited as a possible cause of treatment failure (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_precautions_id_prec">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>). If a significant loss 
of drug product is observed or suspected because of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, a second full dose 
of mefloquine should be administered to patients who vomit less than 30 minutes 
after receiving the drug. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> occurs 30 to 60 minutes after a dose, an 
additional half-dose should be given. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> recurs, the patient should be 
monitored closely and alternative <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438067" conceptname="Malaria">malaria</span> treatment considered if improvement is
