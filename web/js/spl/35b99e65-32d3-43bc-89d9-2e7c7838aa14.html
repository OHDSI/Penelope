<p class="First"><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY<br>Central Nervous System</span><br>Oxycodone is a semisynthetic pure opioid agonist whose principal therapeutic action is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>. Other pharmacological effects of oxycodone include anxiolysis, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142453" conceptname="Feeling high">euphoria</span> and feelings of relaxation. These effects are mediated by receptors (notably μ and κ) in the central nervous system for endogenous opioid-like compounds such as endorphins and enkephalins. Oxycodone produces <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> through direct activity at respiratory centers in the brain stem and depresses the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> reflex by direct effect on the center of the medulla.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen is a non-opiate, non-salicylate analgesic and antipyretic. The site and mechanism for the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span> of acetaminophen has not been determined. The antipyretic effect of acetaminophen is accomplished through the inhibition of endogenous pyrogen action on the hypothalamic heat-regulating centers.<br> </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle</span><br>Oxycodone reduces motility by increasing smooth muscle tone in the stomach and duodenum. In the small intestine, digestion of food is delayed by decreases in propulsive contractions. Other opioid effects include contraction of biliary tract smooth muscle, spasm of the Sphincter of Oddi, increased ureteral and bladder sphincter tone, and a reduction in uterine tone.<br> </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Cardiovascular System</span><br>Oxycodone may produce a release of histamine and may be associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span>, and other symptoms, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318566" conceptname="Flushing">flushing</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442546" conceptname="Red eye">red eyes</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span>.<br> </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span><br>Absorption and Distribution<br>The mean absolute oral bioavailability of oxycodone in cancer patients was reported to be about 87%. Oxycodone has been shown to be 45% bound to human plasma proteins in vitro. The volume of distribution after intravenous administration is 211.9 ±186.6 L.<br></p>
<p>Absorption of acetaminophen is rapid and almost complete from the GI tract after oral administration. With overdosage, absorption is complete in 4 hours. Acetaminophen is relatively uniformly distributed throughout most body fluids. Binding of the drug to plasma proteins is variable; only 20% to 50% may be bound at the concentrations encountered during acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>.<br> </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Metabolism and Elimination</span><br>A high portion of oxycodone is N-dealkylated to noroxycodone during first-pass metabolism. Oxymorphone, is formed by the O-demethylation of oxycodone. The metabolism of oxycodone to oxymorphone is catalyzed by CYP2D6. Free and conjugated noroxycodone, free and conjugated oxycodone, and oxymorphone are excreted in human urine following a single oral dose of oxycodone. Approximately 8% to 14% of the dose is excreted as free oxycodone over 24 hours after administration. Following a single, oral dose of oxycodone, the mean ± SD elimination half-life is 3.51 ± 1.43 hours.<br></p>
<p>Acetaminophen is metabolized in the liver via cytochrome P450 microsomal enzyme. About 80-85% of the acetaminophen in the body is conjugated principally with glucuronic acid and to a lesser extent with sulfuric acid and cysteine. After hepatic conjugation, 90 to 100% of the drug is recovered in the urine within the first day.<br></p>
<p>About 4% of acetaminophen is metabolized via cytochrome P450 oxidase to a toxic metabolite which is further detoxified by conjugation with glutathione, present in a fixed amount. It is believed that the toxic metabolite NAPQI (N acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine, N-acetylimidoquinone) is responsible for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4337543" conceptname="Hepatic necrosis">liver necrosis</span>. High doses of acetaminophen may deplete the glutathione stores so that inactivation of the toxic metabolite is decreased. At high doses, the capacity of metabolic pathways for conjugation with glucuronic acid and sulfuric acid may be exceeded, resulting in increased metabolism of acetaminophen by alternate pathways.<br></p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNINGS<br>Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Opioids</span><br>Oxycodone is an opioid agonist of the morphine-type. Such drugs are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion.<br></p>
<p>Oxycodone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing XOLOX in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. Concerns about misuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>.<br></p>
<p>Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.<br></p>
<p>Administration of XOLOX should be closely monitored for the following potentially serious adverse reactions and complications:<br> </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">Respiratory Depression</span></span><br><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">Respiratory depression</span> is a hazard with the use of oxycodone, one of the active ingredients in XOLOX, as with all opioid agonists. Elderly and debilitated patients are at particular risk for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> as are non-tolerant patients given large initial doses of oxycodone or when oxycodone is given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Oxycodone should be used with extreme caution in patients with acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>, chronic obstructive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="257907" conceptname="Disorder of lung">pulmonary disorder</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255573" conceptname="Chronic obstructive lung disease">COPD</span>), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4307356" conceptname="Cor pulmonale">cor pulmonale</span>, or preexisting respiratory impairment.

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drug/Drug Interactions with Acetaminophen</span><br>Alcohol, ethyl: Hepatotoxicity has occurred in chronic alcoholics following various dose levels (moderate to excessive) of acetaminophen.<br></p>
<p>Anticholinergics: The onset of acetaminophen effect may be delayed or decreased slightly, but the ultimate pharmacological effect is not significantly affected by anticholinergics.<br></p>
<p>Oral Contraceptives: Increase in glucuronidation resulting in increased plasma clearance and a decreased half-life of acetaminophen.<br></p>

<p>Beta Blockers (Propanolol): Propranolol appears to inhibit the enzyme systems responsible for the glucuronidation and oxidation of acetaminophen. Therefore, the pharmacologic effects of acetaminophen may be increased.<br></p>
<p>Loop diuretics: The effects of the loop diuretic may be decreased because acetaminophen may decrease renal prostaglandin excretion and decrease plasma renin activity.<br></p>
<p>Lamotrigine: Serum lamotrigine concentrations may be reduced, producing a decrease in therapeutic effects.<br></p>
<p>Probenecid: Probenecid may increase the therapeutic effectiveness of acetaminophen slightly.<br></p>
<p>Zidovudine: The pharmacologic effects of zidovudine may be decreased because of enhanced non-hepatic or renal clearance of zidovudine.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></span><br>XOLOX is a Schedule II controlled substance. Oxycodone is a mu-agonist opioid with an abuse liability similar to morphine. Oxycodone, like morphine and other opioids used in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, can be abused and is subject to criminal diversion.<br></p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug addiction</span> is defined as an abnormal, compulsive use, use for non-medical purposes of a substance despite physical, psychological, occupational or interpersonal difficulties resulting from such use, and continued use despite harm or risk of harm. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug addiction</span> is a treatable disease, utilizing a multi-disciplinary approach, but relapse is common. Opioid addiction is relatively rare in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436096" conceptname="Chronic pain">chronic pain</span> but may be more common in individuals who have a past history of alcohol or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4279309" conceptname="Substance abuse">substance abuse</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>. Pseudoaddiction refers to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relief seeking behavior of patients whose <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> is poorly managed. It is considered an iatrogenic effect of ineffective <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> management. The health care provider must assess continuously the psychological and clinical condition of a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> patient in order to distinguish addiction from pseudoaddiction and thus, be able to treat the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> adequately.<br></p>
<p>Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> on a prescribed medication does not signify addiction. Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> involves the occurrence of a withdrawal syndrome when there is sudden reduction or cessation in drug use or if an opiate antagonist is administered. Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> can be detected after a few days of opioid therapy. However, clinically significant physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> is only seen after several weeks of relatively high dosage therapy. In this case, abrupt discontinuation of the opioid may result in a withdrawal syndrome. If the discontinuation of opioids is therapeutically indicated, gradual tapering of the drug over a 2-week period will prevent withdrawal symptoms. The severity of the withdrawal syndrome depends primarily on the daily dosage of the opioid, the duration of therapy and medical status of the individual.<br></p>

<p>“Drug-seeking? behavior is very common in addicts and drug abusers. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated “loss? of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). “Doctor Shopping? to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>.<br></p>
<p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction and is characterized by misuse for non-medical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. Oxycodone, like other opioids, has been diverted for non-medical use. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised.<br></p>
<p>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.<br></p>
<p>Like other opioid medications, XOLOX is subject to the Federal Controlled Substances Act. After chronic use, XOLOX should not be discontinued abruptly when it is thought that the patient has become physically dependent on oxycodone.<br><br><span class="Bold">Interactions with Alcohol and Drugs of Abuse</span><br>Oxycodone may be expected to have additive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.</p>

Therefore, an appropriate dose of naloxone hydrochloride should be administered (usual initial adult dose 0.4 mg-2 mg) preferably by the intravenous route, simultaneously with efforts at respiratory resuscitation. Since the duration of action of oxycodone may exceed that of the antagonist, the patient should be kept under continued surveillance and repeated doses of the antagonist should be administered as needed to maintain adequate respiration. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> secondary to oxycodone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. In patients who are physically dependent on any opioid agonist including oxycodone, an abrupt or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute abstinence syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal syndrome produced will depend on the degree of physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> and the dose of the antagonist administered. Please see the prescribing information for the specific opioid antagonist for details of their proper use.<br><br>Gastric emptying and/or lavage may be useful in removing unabsorbed drug. This procedure is recommended as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomited</span> spontaneously. After lavage and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span>, administration of activated charcoal, as a slurry, is beneficial, if less than three hours have passed since ingestion.

A serum acetaminophen assay should be obtained as soon as possible, but no sooner than 4 hours following ingestion. Liver function studies should be obtained initially and repeated at 24-hour intervals. The antidote N-acetylcysteine (NAC) should be administered as early as possible, preferably within 16 hours of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> ingestion, but in any case within 24 hours. As a guide to treatment of acute ingestion, the acetaminophen level can be plotted against time since ingestion on a nomogram (Rumack- Matthew). The upper toxic line on the nomogram is equivalent to 200 mcg/ml at 4 hours while the lower line is equivalent to 50 mcg/ml at 12 hours. If serum level is above the lower line, an entire course of N-acetylcysteine treatment should be instituted.
