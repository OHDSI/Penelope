<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Pyrazinamide is well absorbed from the GI tract and attains peak plasma concentrations within 2 hours. Plasma concentrations generally range from 30 to 50 mcg/mL with doses of 20 to 25 mg/kg. It is widely distributed in body tissues and fluids including the liver, lungs and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The CSF concentration is approximately equal to concurrent steady-state plasma concentrations in patients with inflamed meninges.<span class="Sup">1</span> Pyrazinamide is approximately 10% bound to plasma proteins.<span class="Sup">2</span></p>
<p>The half-life (t1/2) of pyrazinamide is 9 to 10 hours in patients with normal renal and hepatic function. The plasma half-life may be prolonged in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. Pyrazinamide is hydrolyzed in the liver to its major active metabolite, pyrazinoic acid. Pyrazinoic acid is hydroxylated to the main excretory product, 5-hydroxypyrazinoic acid.<span class="Sup"> 3</span></p>
<p>Approximately 70% of an oral dose is excreted in urine, mainly by glomerular filtration within 24 hours.<span class="Sup"> 3</span></p>
<p>Pyrazinamide may be bacteriostatic or bactericidal against <span class="Italics">Mycobacterium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span></span> depending on the concentration of the drug attained at the site of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>. The mechanism of action is unknown. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in vivo </span>the drug is active only at a slightly acidic pH.</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS &amp; USAGE</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Pyrazinamide is indicated for the initial treatment of active <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span> in adults and children when combined with other antituberculous agents. (The current recommendation of the CDC for drug-susceptible disease is to use a six-month regimen for initial treatment of active <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span>, consisting of isoniazid, rifampin and pyrazinamide given for 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampin for 4 months.*<span class="Sup"> 4</span>) </p>
<p>(Patients with drug-resistant disease should be treated with regimens individualized to their situation. Pyrazinamide frequently will be an important component of such therapy.)</p>
<p>(In patients with concomitant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439727" conceptname="Human immunodeficiency virus infection">HIV infection</span>, the physician should be aware of current recommendations of CDC. It is possible these patients may require a longer course of treatment.)</p>
<p>It is also indicated after treatment failure with other primary drugs in any form of active <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span>.</p>
<p>Pyrazinamide should only be used in conjunction with other effective antituberculous agents.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Patients started on pyrazinamide should have baseline serum uric acid and liver function determinations. Those patients with preexisting liver disease or those at increased risk for drug related <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> (e.g., alcohol abusers) should be followed closely.</p>
<p>Pyrazinamide should be discontinued and not be resumed if signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">hepatocellular damage</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4147761" conceptname="Hyperuricemia">hyperuricemia</span> accompanied by an acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="74892" conceptname="Articular gout">gouty arthritis</span> appear.</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Pyrazinamide inhibits renal excretion of urates, frequently resulting in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4147761" conceptname="Hyperuricemia">hyperuricemia</span> which is usually asymptomatic. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4147761" conceptname="Hyperuricemia">hyperuricemia</span> is accompanied by acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="74892" conceptname="Articular gout">gouty arthritis</span>, pyrazinamide should be discontinued.</p>
<p>Pyrazinamide should be used with caution in patients with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus, as management may be more difficult.</p>
<p>Primary resistance of <span class="Italics">M. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span></span> to pyrazinamide is uncommon. In cases with known or suspected <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4150981" conceptname="Drug resistance">drug resistance</span>, <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> susceptibility tests with recent cultures of <span class="Italics">M. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span> </span>against pyrazinamide and the usual primary drugs should be performed. There are few reliable <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> tests for pyrazinamide resistance. A reference laboratory capable of performing these studies must be employed.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Patients should be instructed to notify their physicians promptly if they experience any of the following: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, loss of appetite, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4272240" conceptname="Malaise">malaise</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, darkened urine, yellowish discoloration of the skin and eyes, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span> of the joints.</p>
<p>Compliance with the full course of therapy must be emphasized, and the importance of not missing any doses must be stressed.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Baseline liver function studies [especially ALT (SGPT), AST (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4094657" conceptname="Aspartate aminotransferase">SGOT</span>) determinations] and uric acid levels should be determined prior to therapy. Appropriate laboratory testing should be performed at periodic intervals and if any clinical signs or symptoms occur during therapy.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pyrazinamide has been reported to interfere with ACETEST<span class="Sup">Â®</span> and KETOSTIX<span class="Sup">Â®</span> urine tests to produce a pink-brown color.<span class="Sup"> 5</span></p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>In lifetime bioassays in rats and mice, pyrazinamide was administered in the diet at concentrations of up to 10,000 ppm. This resulted in estimated daily doses for the mouse of 2 g/kg, or 40 times the maximum human dose, and for the rat of 0.5 g/kg, or 10 times the maximum human dose. Pyrazinamide was not carcinogenic in rats or male mice and no conclusion was possible for female mice due to insufficient numbers of surviving control mice.</p>
<p>Pyrazinamide was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial test, but induced chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocyte cell cultures.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with pyrazinamide. It is also not known whether pyrazinamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Pyrazinamide should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pyrazinamide has been found in small amounts in breast milk. Therefore, it is advised the pyrazinamide be used with caution in nursing mothers taking into account the risk-benefit of this therapy.<span class="Sup">9</span></p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pyrazinamide regimens employed in adults are probably equally effective in children.<span class="Sup">4, 10, 11</span> Pyrazinamide appears to be well tolerated in children.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Clinical studies of pyrazinamide did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic or renal function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>
<p>It does not appear that patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> require a reduction in dose. It may be prudent to select doses at the low end of the dosing range, however.<span class="Sup">13</span></p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34068-7">
<a name="section-9"></a><p></p>
<h1>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Pyrazinamide should always be administered with other effective antituberculous drugs. It is administered for the initial 2 months of a 6-month or longer treatment regimen for drug-susceptible patients. Patients who are known or suspected to have drug-resistant disease should be treated with regimens individualized to their situation. Pyrazinamide frequently will be an important component of such therapy.</p>
<p>Patients with concomitant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439727" conceptname="Human immunodeficiency virus infection">HIV infection</span> may require longer courses of therapy. Physicians treating such patients should be alert to any revised recommendations from CDC for this group of patients.</p>
<p>Usual dose: Pyrazinamide is administered orally, 15 to 30 mg/kg once daily. Older regimens employed 3 to 4 divided doses daily, but most current recommendations are for once a day. Three grams per day should not be exceeded. The CDC recommendations do not exceed 2 g per day when given as a daily regimen (see table).</p>
<p>Alternatively, a twice weekly dosing regimen (50 to 70 mg/kg twice weekly based on lean body weight) has been developed to promote patient compliance with a regimen on an outpatient basis. In studies evaluating the twice weekly regimen, doses of pyrazinamide in excess of 3 g twice weekly have been administered. This exceeds the recommended maximum 3 g/daily dose. However, an increased incidence of adverse reactions has not been reported.</p>
<p>The table is taken from the CDC-American Thoracic Society joint recommendations:<span class="Sup">4</span></p>
