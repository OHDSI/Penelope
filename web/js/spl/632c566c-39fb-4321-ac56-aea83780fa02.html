<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">This product combines the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effects</span> of a centrally acting analgesic, codeine, with the peripherally acting analgesics, acetaminophen.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">The behavior of the individual components is described below.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s5"></a><a name="section-4.1.1"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Codeine:</span> Codeine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is rapidly distributed from the intravascular spaces to the various body tissues, with preferential uptake by parenchymatous organs such as the liver, spleen and kidney. Codeine crosses the blood-brain barrier, and is found in fetal tissue and breast milk. The plasma concentration does not correlate with brain concentration or relief of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>; however, codeine is not bound to plasma proteins and does not accumulate in body tissues.</p>
<p>The plasma half-life is about 2.9 hours. The elimination of codeine is primarily via the kidneys, and about 90% of an oral dose is excreted by the kidneys within 24 hours of dosing. The urinary secretion products consist of free and glucuronide conjugated codeine (about 70%), free and conjugated norcodeine (about 10%), free and conjugated morphine (about 10%), normorphine (4%), and hydrocodone (1%). The remainder of the dose is excreted in the feces.</p>
<p>At therapeutic doses, the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span> reaches a peak within 2 hours and persists between 4 and 6 hours.</p>
<p>See <span class="Bold"><a href="#s26">OVERDOSAGE</a></span> for toxicity information.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s6"></a><a name="section-4.1.2"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Acetaminophen:</span> Acetaminophen is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is distributed throughout most body tissues. The plasma half-life is 1.25 to 3 hours, but may be increased by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver damage</span> and following overdosage. Elimination of acetaminophen is principally by liver metabolism (conjugation) and subsequent renal excretion of metabolites. Approximately 85% of an oral dose appears in the urine within 24 hours of administration, most as the glucuronide conjugate, with small amounts of other conjugates and unchanged drug.</p>

<h3>Ultra-rapid Metabolizers of Codeine</h3>
<p class="First">Some individuals may be ultra-rapid metabolizers due to a specific CYP2D6*2x2 genotype.  These individuals convert codeine into its active metabolite, morphine, more rapidly and completely than other people. This rapid conversion results in higher than expected serum morphine levels.  Even at labeled dosage regiments, individuals who are ultra-rapid metabolizers may experience <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> symptoms such as extreme <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302536" conceptname="Shallow breathing">shallow breathing</span>.</p>
<p>The prevalence of this CYP2D6 phenotype varies widely and has been estimated at 0.5 to 1% in Chinese and Japanese, 0.5 to 1% in Hispanics, 1-10% in Caucasians, 3% in African Americans, and 16-28% in North Africans, Ethiopians and Arabs. Data is not available for other ethnic groups.</p>
<p>When physicians prescribe codeine-containing drugs, they should choose the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time and should inform their patients about these risks and the signs of morphine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. <span class="Bold">(See <a href="#s22">PRECATIONS-Nursing Mothers</a>)</span></p>

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Codeine may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery. Such tasks should be avoided while taking this product.</p>
<p>Alcohol and other CNS depressants may produce an additive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span>, when taken with this combination product, and should be avoided.</p>
<p>Codeine may be habit-forming. Patients should take the drug only for as long as it is prescribed, in the amounts prescribed, and no more frequently than prescribed.</p>
<p>Caution patients that some people have a variation in a liver enzyme and change codeine into morphine more rapidly and completely than other people.  These people are ultra-rapid metabolizers and are more likely to have higher-than-normal levels of morphine in their blood after taking codeine which can result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> symptoms such as extreme <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302536" conceptname="Shallow breathing">shallow breathing</span>. In most cases, it is unknown if someone is an ultra-rapid codeine metabolizer.</p>
<p>Nursing mothers taking codeine can also have higher morphine levels in their breast milk if they are ultra-rapid metabolizers. These higher levels of morphine in breast milk may lead to life threatening of fatal side effects in nursing babies. Instruct nursing mothers to watch for signs of morphine toxicity in their infants including increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, or limpness.  Instruct nursing mothers to talk to the baby's doctor immediately if they notice these signs and, if they cannot reach the doctor right away, to take the baby to an emergency room or call 911 (or local emergency services).</p>

<a name="s19"></a><a name="section-8.7.1.1"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Codeine:</span> A study in rats and rabbits reported no teratogenic effect of codeine administered during the period of organogenesis in doses ranging from 5 to 120 mg/kg. In the rat, doses at the 120 mg/kg level, in the toxic range for the adult animal, were associated with an increase in embryo resorption at the time of implantation. In another study a single 100 mg/kg dose of codeine administered to pregnant mice reportedly resulted in delayed ossification in the offspring.</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. CODRIXâ„¢ should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<h2>Labor and Delivery</h2>
<p class="First">Narcotic analgesics cross the placental barrier. The closer to delivery and the larger the dose used, the greater the possibility of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> in the newborn. Narcotic analgesics should be avoided during labor if delivery of a premature infant is anticipated. If the mother has received narcotic analgesics during labor, newborn infants should be observed closely for signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>. Resuscitation may be required (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s26">OVERDOSAGE</a></span>). The effect of codeine, if any, on the later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child is unknown.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34080-2">
<a name="s22"></a><a name="section-8.9"></a><p></p>
<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Codeine is secreted into human milk.  In women with normal codeine metabolism (normal CYP2D6 activity), the amount of codeine secreted into human milk is low and dose-dependent.  Despite the common use of codeine products to manage postpartum <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, reports of adverse events in infants are rare.  However, some women are ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine. These women achieve higher-than-expected serum levels of codeine's active metabolite, morphine, leading to higher-than-expected levels of morphine in breast milk and potentially dangerously high serum morphine levels in their breastfed infants.  Therefore, maternal use of codeine can potentially lead to serious adverse reactions, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>, in nursing infants.</p>
<p>The prevalence of this CYP2D6 phenotype varies widely and has been estimated at 0.5 to 1% in Chinese and Japanese, 0.5 to 1% in Hispanics, 1-10% in Caucasians, 3% in African Americans, and 16-28% in North Africans, Ethiopians and Arabs. Data is not available for other ethnic groups.</p>
<p>The risk of infant exposure to codeine and morphine through breast milk should be weighed against the benefits of breastfeeding for both the mother and baby.  Caution should be exercised when codeine is administered to a nursing woman.  If a codeine containing product is selected, the lowest dose should be prescribed for the shortest period of time to achieve the desired clinical effect.  Mothers using codeine should be informed about when to seek immediate medical care and how to identify the signs and symptoms of neonatal toxicity, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> or sedation, difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, and decreased tone, in their baby.  Nursing mothers who are ultra-rapid metabolizers may also experience <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> symptoms such as extreme <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302536" conceptname="Shallow breathing">shallow breathing</span>.  Prescribers should closely monitor mother-infant pairs and notify treating pediatricians about the use of codeine during breastfeeding.

<p class="First">A single or multiple <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> with acetaminophen and codeine is a potentially lethal polydrug <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, and consultation with a regional poison control center is recommended.</p>
<p>Immediate treatment includes support of cardiorespiratory function and measures to reduce drug absorption. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">Vomiting</span> should be induced mechanically, or with syrup of ipecac, if the patient is alert (adequate pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes). Oral activated charcoal (1 g/kg) should follow gastric emptying. The first dose should be accompanied by an appropriate cathartic. If repeated doses are used, the cathartic might be included with alternate doses as required. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> is usually hypovolemic and should respond to fluids. Vasopressors and other supportive measures should be employed as indicated. A cuffed endo-tracheal tube should be inserted before gastric lavage of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372448" conceptname="Loss of consciousness">unconscious</span> patient and, when necessary, to provide assisted respiration.</p>
<p>Meticulous attention should be given to maintaining adequate pulmonary ventilation. In severe cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>, peritoneal dialysis, or preferably hemodialysis may be considered. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4253058" conceptname="Factor II deficiency">hypoprothrombinemia</span> occurs due to acetaminophen <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, vitamin K should be administered intravenously.</p>
<p>Naloxone, a narcotic antagonist, can reverse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span> associated with opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. Naloxone hydrochloride 0.4 mg to 2 mg is given parenterally. Since the duration of action of codeine may exceed that of the naloxone, the patient should be kept under continuous surveillance and repeated doses of the antagonist should be administered as needed to maintain adequate respiration. A narcotic antagonist should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or cardiovascular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.</p>
<p>If the dose of acetaminophen may have exceeded 140 mg/kg, acetylcysteine should be administered as early as possible. Serum acetaminophen levels should be obtained, since levels fours or more hours following ingestion help predict acetaminophen toxicity. Do not await acetaminophen assay results before initiating treatment. Hepatic enzymes should be obtained initially, and repeated at 24-hour intervals.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">Methemoglobinemia</span> over 30% should be treated with methylene blue by slow intravenous administration.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Dosage should be adjusted according to severity of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> and response of the patient.</p>
<p>The usual adult dosage is:</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>The usual dose of codeine phosphate in <span class="Bold">children</span> is 0.5 mg/kg.</p>
<p>Doses may be repeated up to every 4 hours.</p>
<p>The prescriber must determine the number of tablets per dose, and the maximum number of tablets per 24 hours based upon the above dosage guidance. This information should be conveyed in the prescription.</p>
<p>It should be kept in mind, however, that tolerance to codeine can develop with continued use and that the incidence of untoward effects is dose related. Adult doses of codeine higher than 60 mg fail to give commensurate relief of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> but merely prolong <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> and are associated with an appreciably increased incidence of undesirable side effects.  Equivalently high doses in children would have similar effects.</p>
