<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">The barbiturates are nonselective central nervous system (CNS) depressants that are primarily used as sedative hypnotics. In subhypnotic doses, they are also used as anticonvulsants. The barbiturates and their sodium salts are subject to control under the Federal Controlled Substances Act.</p>
<p>Amobarbital sodium is a white, friable, granular powder that is odorless, has a bitter taste, and is hygroscopic. It is very soluble in water, soluble in alcohol, and practically insoluble in ether and chloroform. Amobarbital sodium is sodium 5-ethyl-5-isopentylbarbiturate and has the empirical formula C<span class="Sub">11</span>H<span class="Sub">17</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>NaO<span class="Sub">3</span>Its molecular weight is 248.26.</p>
<p>It has the following structural formula:</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Barbiturates are capable of producing all levels of CNS mood alteration, from excitation to mild sedation, hypnosis, and deep <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>. Overdosage can produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. In high enough therapeutic doses, barbiturates induce anesthesia.</p>
<p>Barbiturates depress the sensory cortex, decrease motor activity, alter cerebellar function, and produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, sedation, and hypnosis.</p>
<p>Barbiturate-induced sleep differs from physiologic sleep. Sleep laboratory studies have demonstrated that barbiturates reduce the amount of time spent in the rapid eye movement (REM) phase of sleep or the dreaming stage. Also, Stages III and IV sleep are decreased. Following abrupt cessation of barbiturates used regularly, patients may experience markedly increased dreaming, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4009184" conceptname="Dream anxiety disorder">nightmares</span>, and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>. Therefore, withdrawal of a single therapeutic dose over 5 or 6 days has been recommended to lessen the REM rebound and disturbed sleep that contribute to the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441260" conceptname="Drug withdrawal">drug withdrawal syndrome</span> (for example, the dose should be decreased from 3 to 2 doses/day for 1 week).</p>
<p>In studies, secobarbital sodium and pentobarbital sodium have been found to lose most of their effectiveness for both inducing and maintaining sleep by the end of 2 weeks of continued drug administration, even with the use of multiple doses. As with secobarbital sodium and pentobarbital sodium, other barbiturates (including amobarbital) might be expected to lose their effectiveness for inducing and maintaining sleep after about 2 weeks. The short-, intermediate-, and to a lesser degree, long-acting barbiturates have been widely prescribed for treating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>. Although the clinical literature abounds with claims that the short-acting barbiturates are superior for producing sleep whereas the intermediate-acting compounds are more effective in maintaining sleep, controlled studies have failed to demonstrate these differential effects. Therefore, as sleep medications, the barbiturates are of limited value beyond short-term use.</p>
<p>Barbiturates have little analgesic action at subanesthetic doses. Rather, in subanesthetic doses, these drugs may increase the reaction to painful stimuli. All barbiturates exhibit anticonvulsant activity in anesthetic doses. However, of the drugs in this class, only phenobarbital, mephobarbital, and metharbital are effective as oral anticonvulsants in subhypnotic doses.</p>
<p>Barbiturates are respiratory depressants, and the degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> is dependent upon the dose. With hypnotic doses, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> produced by barbiturates is similar to that which occurs during physiologic sleep and is accompanied by a slight decrease in blood pressure and heart rate.</p>
<p>Studies in laboratory animals have shown that barbiturates cause reduction in the tone and contractility of the uterus, ureters, and urinary bladder. However, concentrations of the drugs required to produce this effect in humans are not reached with sedative-hypnotic doses.</p>
<p>Barbiturates do not impair normal hepatic function but have been shown to induce liver microsomal enzymes, thus increasing and/or altering the metabolism of barbiturates and other drugs (<span class="Italics">see </span>Drug Interactions under Precautions).</p>

<h2>
<span class="Italics">Pharmacokinetics</span> â€”</h2>
<p class="First">Barbiturates are absorbed in varying degrees following oral or parenteral administration. The salts are more rapidly absorbed than are the acids. The rate of absorption is increased if the sodium salt is ingested as a dilute solution or taken on an empty stomach.</p>
<p>The onset of action for oral administration of barbiturates varies from 20 to 60 minutes. For intramuscular (IM) administration, the onset of action is slightly faster. Following intravenous (IV) administration, the onset of action ranges from almost immediately for pentobarbital sodium to 5 minutes for phenobarbital sodium. Maximal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span> may not occur until 15 minutes or more after IV administration for phenobarbital sodium. Duration of action, which is related to the rate at which the barbiturates are redistributed throughout the body, varies among persons and in the same person from time to time. Amobarbital sodium, an intermediate-acting barbiturate, is a CNS depressant. For the oral form, the onset of sedative and hypnotic action is 3/4 to 1 hour, with a duration of action ranging from 6 to 8 hours. These values should serve as a guide but not be used to predict exact duration of effect. No studies have demonstrated that the different routes of administration are equivalent with respect to bioavailability.</p>
<p>Barbiturates are weak acids that are absorbed and rapidly distributed to all tissues and fluids, with high concentrations in the brain, liver, and kidneys. Lipid solubility of the barbiturates is the dominant factor in their distribution within the body. The more lipid soluble the barbiturate, the more rapidly it penetrates all tissues of the body. Barbiturates are bound to plasma and tissue proteins to a varying degree, with the degree of binding increasing directly as a function of lipid solubility.</p>
<p>Phenobarbital has the lowest lipid solubility, lowest plasma binding, lowest brain protein binding, the longest delay in onset of activity, and the longest duration of action. At the opposite extreme is secobarbital, which has the highest lipid solubility, highest plasma protein binding, highest brain protein binding, the shortest delay in onset of activity, and the shortest duration of action. Amobarbital sodium is classified as an intermediate barbiturate. The plasma half-life for amobarbital sodium in adults ranges between 16 and 40 hours, with a mean of 25 hours.</p>
<p>Barbiturates are metabolized primarily by the hepatic microsomal enzyme system, and the metabolic products are excreted in the urine and, less commonly, in the feces. Only a negligible amount of amobarbital sodium is eliminated unchanged in the urine.</p>

<span class="Italics">Usage in Pregnancy </span>â€” Barbiturates can cause fetal damage when administered to a pregnant woman. Retrospective, case-controlled studies have suggested a connection between the maternal consumption of barbiturates and a higher than expected incidence of fetal abnormalities. Barbiturates readily cross the placental barrier and are distributed throughout fetal tissues; the highest concentrations are found in the placenta, fetal liver, and brain. Fetal blood levels approach maternal blood levels following parenteral administration. Withdrawal symptoms occur in infants born to women who receive barbiturates throughout the last trimester of pregnancy (<span class="Italics">see </span><a href="#LINK_6d31803d-58fa-4ab7-98ff-bc6d7c6ee6a5">Drug Abuse and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">Dependence</span></a>).

<span class="Italics">General</span> â€”</h2>
<p class="First">Barbiturates may be habit forming.

<p>Barbiturates should be administered with caution, if at all, to patients who are mentally depressed, have suicidal tendencies, or have a history of drug abuse. Particular caution is also indicated before administering barbiturates to patients who have abused other classes of drugs (<span class="Italics">see </span><a href="#LINK_e3c2eef8-7132-44cc-82f4-c281ab39b92a">Warnings</a>).</p>
<p>Elderly or debilitated patients may react to barbiturates with marked <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">excitement</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>.

<h2>
<span class="Italics">Drug Interactions</span> â€”</h2>
<p class="First">Most reports of clinically significant drug interactions occurring with the barbiturates have involved phenobarbital. However, the application of these data to other barbiturates appears valid and warrants serial blood level determinations of the relevant drugs when there are multiple therapies.</p>
<dl>
<dt>1.</dt>
<dd>
<span class="Italics">Anticoagulants </span>â€” Phenobarbital lowers the plasma levels of dicumarol and causes a decrease in anticoagulant activity as measured by the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time. Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon). Patients stabilized on anticoagulant therapy may require dosage adjustments if barbiturates are added to or withdrawn from their dosage regimen.</dd>
<dt>2.</dt>
<dd>
<span class="Italics">Corticosteroids </span>â€” Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids, probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes. Patients stabilized on corticosteroid therapy may require dosage adjustments if barbiturates are added to or withdrawn from their dosage regimen.</dd>
<dt>3.</dt>
<dd>
<span class="Italics">Griseofulvin </span>â€” Phenobarbital appears to interfere with the absorption of orally administered griseofulvin, thus decreasing its blood level. The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established. However, it would be preferable to avoid concomitant administration of these drugs.</dd>
<dt>4.</dt>
<dd>
<span class="Italics">Doxycycline </span>â€” Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued. This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic. If amobarbital sodium and doxycycline are administered concurrently, the clinical response to doxycycline should be monitored closely.</dd>
<dt>5.</dt>
<dd>
<span class="Italics">Phenytoin, Sodium Valproate, Valproic Acid </span>â€” The effect of barbiturates on the metabolism of phenytoin appears to be variable. Some investigators report an accelerating effect, whereas others report no effect. Because the effect of barbiturates on the metabolism of phenytoin is not predictable, phenytoin and barbiturate blood levels should be monitored more frequently if these drugs are given concurrently. Sodium valproate and valproic acid appear to increase the amobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, amobarbital sodium blood levels should be closely monitored and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.</dd>
<dt>6.</dt>
<dd>
<span class="Italics">CNS Depressants </span>â€” The concomitant use of other CNS depressants, including other sedatives or hypnotics, antihistamines, tranquilizers, or alcohol, may produce additive depressant effects.</dd>
<dt>7.</dt>
<dd>
<span class="Italics">Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) </span>â€” MAOIs prolong the effects of barbiturates, probably because metabolism of the barbiturate is inhibited.</dd>
<dt>8.</dt>
<dd>
<span class="Italics">Estradiol, Estrone, Progesterone, and Other Steroidal Hormones </span>â€” Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism. There have been reports of patients treated with antiepileptic drugs (eg, phenobarbital) who become pregnant while taking oral contraceptives. An alternate contraceptive method might be suggested to women taking barbiturates.</dd>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">The following adverse reactions and their incidence were compiled from surveillance of thousands of hospitalized patients who received barbiturates. Because such patients may be less aware of certain of the milder adverse effects of barbiturates, the incidence of these reactions may be somewhat higher in fully ambulatory patients.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">More than 1 in 100 Patients</span></p>
<p>The most common adverse reaction, estimated to occur at a rate of 1 to 3 patients per 100, is the following:<br><span class="Italics">Nervous System: </span>SomnolenceÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â </p>

<p class="First">Barbiturates may be habit-forming. Tolerance, psychological <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>, and physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> may occur, especially following prolonged use of high doses of barbiturates. Daily administration in excess of 400 mg of pentobarbital or secobarbital for approximately 90 days is likely to produce some degree of physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>. A dosage of 600 to 800 mg for at least 35 days is sufficient to produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218977" conceptname="Drug withdrawal seizure">withdrawal seizures</span>. The average daily dose for the barbiturate addict is usually about 1.5 g. As tolerance to barbiturates develops, the amount needed to maintain the same level of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> increases; tolerance to a fatal dosage, however, does not increase more than twofold. As this occurs, the margin between intoxicating dosage and fatal dosage becomes smaller.</p>
<p>Symptoms of acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> with barbiturates include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437643" conceptname="Abnormal gait">unsteady gait</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196636" conceptname="Dysarthria">slurred speech</span>, and sustained <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378165" conceptname="Nystagmus">nystagmus</span>.

<p>Symptoms of barbiturate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> are similar to those of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435243" conceptname="Alcohol dependence">chronic alcoholism</span>. If an individual appears to be intoxicated with alcohol to a degree that is radically disproportionate to the amount of alcohol in his or her blood, the use of barbiturates should be suspected. The lethal dose of a barbiturate is far less if alcohol is also ingested.</p>
<p>The symptoms of barbiturate withdrawal can be severe and may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. Minor withdrawal symptoms may appear 8 to 12 hours after the last dose of a barbiturate. These symptoms usually appear in the following order: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4247265" conceptname="Muscle twitch">muscle twitching</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span> of hands and fingers, progressive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">weakness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, distortion in visual perception, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span>. Major withdrawal symptoms (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373995" conceptname="Delirium">delirium</span>) may occur within 16 hours and last up to 5 days after abrupt cessation of barbiturates. The intensity of withdrawal symptoms gradually declines over a period of approximately 15 days. Individuals susceptible to barbiturate abuse and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> include alcoholics and opiate abusers, as well as other sedative-hypnotic and amphetamine abusers.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug dependence</span> on barbiturates arises from repeated administration on a continuous basis, generally in amounts exceeding therapeutic dose levels. The characteristics of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">drug dependence</span> on barbiturates include: (a) a strong desire or need to continue taking the drug; (b) a tendency to increase the dose; (c) a psychic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> on the effects of the drug related to subjective and individual appreciation of those effects; and (d) a physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> on the effects of the drug, requiring its presence for maintenance of homeostasis and resulting in a definite, characteristic, and self-limited abstinence syndrome when the drug is withdrawn.</p>
<p>Treatment of barbiturate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> consists of cautious and gradual withdrawal of the drug. Barbiturate- dependent patients can be withdrawn by using a number of different withdrawal regimens. In all cases, withdrawal requires an extended period of time. One method involves substituting a 30 mg dose of phenobarbital for each 100 to 200 mg dose of barbiturate that the patient has been taking. The total daily amount of phenobarbital is then administered in 3 or 4 divided doses, not to exceed 600 mg daily. If signs of withdrawal occur on the first day of treatment, a loading dose of 100 to 200 mg of phenobarbital may be administered IM in addition to the oral dose. After stabilization on phenobarbital, the total daily dose is decreased by 30 mg/day as long as withdrawal is proceeding smoothly. A modification of this regimen involves initiating treatment at the patientâ€™s regular dosage level and decreasing the daily dosage by 10% if tolerated by the patient.</p>
<p>Infants that are physically dependent on barbiturates may be given phenobarbital, 3 to 10 mg/kg/day. After withdrawal symptoms (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">hyperactivity</span>, disturbed sleep, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremors</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4313132" conceptname="Hyperreflexia">hyperreflexia</span>) are relieved, the dosage of phenobarbital should be gradually decreased and completely withdrawn over a 2-week period.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">The toxic dose of barbiturates varies considerably. In general, an oral dose of 1 g of most barbiturates produces serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">poisoning</span> in an adult. Toxic effects and fatalities have occurred following <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> of amobarbital sodium alone and in combination with other CNS depressants. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Death</span> commonly occurs after 2 to 10 g of ingested barbiturate. The sedated, therapeutic blood levels of amobarbital range between 2 to 10 mcg/mL; the usual lethal blood level ranges from 40 to 80 mcg/mL. Barbiturate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> may be <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confused</span> with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218106" conceptname="Alcoholism">alcoholism</span>, bromide <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>, and various neurologic disorders.

<p class="First">To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, a good resource is your certified Regional Poison Control Center. Telephone numbers of certified poison control centers are listed in the <span class="Italics">Physiciansâ€™ Desk Reference </span>(<span class="Italics">PDR</span>). In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">multiple drug overdoses</span>, interaction among drugs, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient.</p>
<p>Protect the patientâ€™s airway and support ventilation and perfusion. Meticulously monitor and maintain, within acceptable limits, the patientâ€™s vital signs, blood gases, serum electrolytes, etc. Absorption of drugs from the gastrointestinal tract may be decreased by giving activated charcoal, which, in many cases, is more effective than <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> or lavage; consider charcoal instead of or in addition to gastric emptying. Repeated doses of charcoal over time may hasten elimination of some drugs that have been absorbed. Safeguard the patientâ€™s airway when employing gastric emptying or charcoal.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">Diuresis</span> and peritoneal dialysis are of little value; hemodialysis and hemoperfusion enhance drug clearance and should be considered in serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">poisoning</span>.

<h1>PREPARATION OF SOLUTION</h1>
<p class="First">Solutions of amobarbital sodium should be made up aseptically with Sterile Water for Injection. The accompanying table will aid in preparing solutions of various concentrations. Ordinarily, a 10% solution is used. After Sterile Water for Injection is added, the vial should be rotated to facilitate solution of the powder. <span class="Bold">Do not shake the vial.</span></p>
<p>Several minutes may be required for the drug to dissolve completely, but under no circumstances should a solution be injected if it has not become absolutely clear within 5 minutes. Also, a solution that forms a precipitate after clearing should not be used. Amobarbital sodium hydrolyzes in solution or on exposure to air. Not more than 30 minutes should elapse from the time the vial is opened until its contents are injected. Prior to administration, parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration whenever solution containers permit.</p>

<p class="First">The dose of amobarbital sodium must be individualized with full knowledge of its particular characteristics and recommended rate of administration. Factors of consideration are the patientâ€™s age, weight, and condition. The maximum single dose for an adult is 1 g.</p>

<h2>
<span class="Italics">Intramuscular Use</span> â€”</h2>
<p class="First">Intramuscular injection of the sodium salts of barbiturates should be made deeply into a large muscle. The average intramuscular dose ranges from 65 mg to 0.5 g. A volume of 5 mL (irrespective of concentration) should not be exceeded at any one site because of possible tissue irritation. Twenty percent solutions may be used so that a small volume can contain a large dose. After IM injection of a hypnotic dose, the patientâ€™s vital signs should be monitored. Superficial intramuscular or subcutaneous injections may be painful and may produce sterile <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="444202" conceptname="Abscess">abscesses</span> or sloughs.</p>

<h2>
<span class="Italics">Intravenous Use</span> â€”</h2>
<p class="First">Intravenous injection is restricted to conditions in which other routes are not feasible, either because the patient is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372448" conceptname="Loss of consciousness">unconscious</span> (as in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="376713" conceptname="Cerebral hemorrhage">cerebral hemorrhage</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443700" conceptname="Eclampsia">eclampsia</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span>), because the patient resists (as in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373995" conceptname="Delirium">delirium</span>), or because prompt action is imperative. Slow IV injection is essential, and patients should be carefully observed during administration. This requires that blood pressure, respiration, and cardiac function be maintained, vital signs be recorded and equipment for resuscitation and artificial ventilation be available. The rate of IV injection for adults should not exceed 50 mg/min to prevent sleep or sudden <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>. The final dosage is determined to a great extent by the patientâ€™s reaction to the slow administration of the drug.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Adults:</span><br>a. Sedative: 30 to 50 mg given 2 or 3 times daily.<br>b. Hypnotic: 65 to 200 mg at bedtime.</p>

<h2>
<span class="Italics">Special Patient Population</span> â€”</h2>
<p class="First">Dosage should be reduced in the elderly or debilitated because these patients may be more sensitive to barbiturates. Dosage should be reduced for patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span>. Ordinarily, an intravenous dose of 65 mg to 0.5 g may be given to a child 6 to 12 years of age.</p>
