<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">The mechanism by which gabapentin exerts its analgesic action is unknown, but in animal models of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, gabapentin prevents allodynia (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>-related behavior in response to a normally innocuous stimulus) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4031840" conceptname="Hyperesthesia">hyperalgesia</span> (exaggerated response to painful stimuli). In particular, gabapentin prevents <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>-related responses in several models of neuropathic painÂ Â  in rats or mice (e.g. spinal nerve ligation models, streptozocin-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> model, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235863" conceptname="Spinal cord injury">spinal cord injury</span> model, acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443943" conceptname="Herpes zoster">herpes zoster</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> model). Gabapentin also decreases <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>-related responses after peripheral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> (carrageenan footpad test, late phase of formalin test). Gabapentin did not alter immediate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>-related behaviors (rat tail flick test, formalin footpad acute phase, acetic acid abdominal constriction test, footpad heat irradiation test). The relevance of these models to human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> is not known.</p>
<p>The mechanism by which gabapentin exerts its anticonvulsant action is unknown, but in animal test systems designed to detect anticonvulsant activity, gabapentin prevents <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> as do other marketed anticonvulsants. Gabapentin exhibits antiseizure activity in mice and rats in both the maximal electroshock and pentylenetetrazole <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> models and other preclinical models (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> with genetic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>, etc.). The relevance of these models to human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> is not known.</p>
<p>Gabapentin is structurally related to the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) but it does not modify GABA<span class="Sub">A</span> or GABA<span class="Sub">B</span> radioligand binding, it is not converted metabolically into GABA or a GABA agonist, and it is not an inhibitor of GABA uptake or degradation. Gabapentin was tested in radioligand binding assays at concentrations up to 100 ÂµM and did not exhibit affinity for a number of other common receptor sites, including benzodiazepine, glutamate, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), quisqualate, kainate, strychnine-insensitive or strychnine-sensitive glycine, alpha 1, alpha 2, or beta adrenergic, adenosine A1 or A2, cholinergic muscarinic or nicotinic, dopamine D1 or D2, histamine H1, serotonin S1 or S2, opiate mu, delta or kappa, cannabinoid 1, voltage-sensitive calcium channel sites labeled with nitrendipine or diltiazem, or at voltage-sensitive sodiumÂ  channel sites labeled with batrachotoxinin A 20-alpha-benzoate. Furthermore, gabapentin did not alter the cellular uptake of dopamine, noradrenaline, or serotonin.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies with radiolabeled gabapentin have revealed a gabapentin binding site in areas of rat brain including neocortex and hippocampus. A high-affinity binding protein in animal brain tissue has been identified as an auxiliary subunit of voltage-activated calcium channels. However, functional correlates of gabapentin binding, if any, remain to be elucidated.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism</h2>
<p class="First">All pharmacological actions followingÂ  gabapentin administration are due to the activity of the parent compound; gabapentin is not appreciably metabolized in humans.</p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section_2.2.1"></a><a name="section-3.3"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Oral Bioavailability:</span> Gabapentin bioavailability is not dose proportional; i.e., as dose is increased, bioavailability decreases. Bioavailability of gabapentin is approximately 60%, 47%, 34%, 33%, and 27% following 900, 1200, 2400, 3600, and 4800 mg/day given in 3 divided doses, respectively. Food has only a slight effect on the rate and extent of absorption of gabapentin (14% increase in AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span></p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Distribution:</span> Less than 3% of gabapentin circulates bound to plasma protein. The apparent volume of distribution of gabapentin after 150 mg intravenous administration is 58Â±6 L (Mean Â±SD). In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>, steady-state predose (C<span class="Sub">min</span>) concentrations of gabapentin in cerebrospinal fluid were approximately 20% of the corresponding plasma concentrations.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Elimination:</span> Gabapentin is eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion as unchanged drug. Gabapentin is not appreciably metabolized in humans.</p>
<p>Gabapentin elimination half-life is 5 to 7 hours and is unaltered by dose or following multiple dosing. Gabapentin elimination rate constant, plasma clearance, and renal clearance are directly proportional to creatinine clearance (see<a href="#section_2.2.4"> Special Populations: Patients With <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span></a>, below). In elderly patients, and in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>, gabapentin plasma clearance is reduced. Gabapentin can be removed from plasma by hemodialysis.</p>
<p>Dosage adjustment in patients with compromised renal function or undergoing hemodialysis is recommended (see <a href="#table6">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Table 6</a>).<br></p>

The mean gabapentin half-life ranged from about 6.5 hours (patients with creatinine clearance &gt;60 mL/min) to 52 hours (creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min) and gabapentin renal clearance from about 90 mL/min (&gt;60 mL/min group) to about 10 mL/min (&lt;30 mL/min). Mean plasma clearance (CL/F) decreased from approximately 190 mL/min to 20 mL/min.</p>
<p>Dosage adjustment in adult patients with compromised renal function is necessary (see <a href="#section_10">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>). Pediatric patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> have not been studied.<br></p>

<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Hemodialysis:</span> In a study in anuric adult subjects (N=11), the apparent elimination half-life of gabapentin on nondialysis days was about 132 hours; during dialysis the apparent half-life of gabapentin was reduced to 3.8 hours. Hemodialysis thus has a significant effect on gabapentin elimination in anuric subjects.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Age:</span> The effect of age was studied in subjects 20 to 80 years of age. Apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of gabapentin decreased as age increased, from about 225 mL/min in those under 30 years of age to about 125 mL/min in those over 70 years of age. Renal clearance (CLr) and CLr adjusted for body surface area also declined with age; however, the decline in the renal clearance of gabapentin with age can largely be explained by the decline in renal function. Reduction of gabapentin dose may be required in patients who have age related compromised renal function. (See <a href="#section_6.9">PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use</a>, and <a href="#section_10">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>.)<br></p>

<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pediatric:</span> Gabapentin pharmacokinetics were determined in 48 pediatric subjects between the ages of 1 month and 12 years following a dose of approximately 10 mg/kg. Peak plasma concentrations were similar across the entire age group and occurred 2 to 3 hours postdose. In general, pediatric subjects between 1 month and &lt;5 years of age achieved approximately 30% lower exposure (AUC) than that observed in those 5 years of age and older. Accordingly, oral clearance normalized per body weight was higher in the younger children. Apparent oral clearanceÂ  of gabapentin was directly proportional to creatinine clearance. Gabapentin elimination half-life averaged 4.7 hours and was similar across the age groups studied.</p>
<p>A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed in 253 pediatric subjects between 1 month and 13 years of age. Patients received 10 to 65 mg/kg/day given TID. Apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was directly proportional to creatinine clearance and this relationship was similar following a single dose and at steady state. Higher oral clearance values were observed in children &lt;5 years of age compared to those observed in children 5 years of age and older, when normalized per body weight. The clearance was highly variable in infants &lt;1 year of age. The normalized CL/F values observed in pediatric patients 5 years of age and older were consistent with values observed in adults after a single dose. The oral volume of distribution normalized per body weight was constant across the age range.</p>
<p>These pharmacokinetic data indicate that the effective daily dose in pediatric patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> ages 3 and 4 years should be 40 mg/kg/day to achieve average plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in patients 5 years of age and older receiving gabapentin at 30 mg/kg/day.

<p>Each study included a 1-week baseline during which patients were screened for eligibility and a 7- or 8-week double-blind phase (3 or 4 weeks of titration and 4 weeks of fixed dose). Patients initiated treatment with titration to a maximum of 900 mg/day gabapentin over 3 days. Dosages were then to be titrated in 600 to 1200 mg/day increments at 3- to 7-day intervals to target dose over 3 to 4 weeks. In Study 1, patients were continued on lower doses if not able to achieve the target dose. During baseline and treatment, patients recorded their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> in a daily diary using an 11-point numeric <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> rating scale ranging from 0 (no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>) to 10 (worst possible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>). A mean <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> score during baseline of at least 4 was required for randomization (baseline mean <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> score for Studies 1 and 2 combined was 6.4).

<p class="First">The effectiveness of gabapentin as adjunctive therapy (added to other antiepileptic drugs) was established in multicenter placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trials in adult and pediatric patients (3 years and older) with refractory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106574" conceptname="Partial seizure">partial seizures</span>.</p>
<p>Evidence of effectiveness was obtained in three trials conducted in 705 patients (age 12 years and above) and one trial conducted in 247 pediatric patients (3 to 12 years of age). The patients enrolled had a history of at least 4 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106574" conceptname="Partial seizure">partial seizures</span> per month in spite of receiving one or more antiepileptic drugs at therapeutic levels and were observed on their established antiepileptic drug regimen during a 12-week baseline period (6 weeks in the study of pediatric patients). In patients continuing to have at least 2 (or 4 in some studies) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> per month, gabapentin or placebo was then added on to the existing therapy during a 12-week treatment period. Effectiveness was assessed primarily on the basis of the percent of patients with a 50% or greater reduction in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> frequency from baseline to treatment (the â€œresponder rateâ€?) and a derived measure called response ratio, a measure of change defined asÂ Â  (T - B)/(T + B), where B is the patientâ€™s baseline <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> frequency and T is the patientâ€™s <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> frequency during treatment. Response ratio is distributed within the range -1 to +1. A zero value indicates no change while complete elimination of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> would give a value of -1; increased seizureÂ Â  rates would give positive values. A response ratio of -0.33Â Â  corresponds to a 50% reduction in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> frequency.Â Â  The results given below are for all <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106574" conceptname="Partial seizure">partial seizures</span> in the intent-to-treat (all patientsÂ Â  who received any doses of treatment) population in each study, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p>One study compared gabapentin 1200 mg/day divided TID with placebo. Responder rate was 23% (14/61) in the gabapentin group and 9% (6/66) in the placebo group; the difference between groups was statistically significant. Response ratio was also better in the gabapentin group (-0.199) than in the placebo group (-0.044), a difference that also achieved statistical significance.</p>
<p>A second study compared primarily 1200 mg/day divided TID gabapentin (N=101) with placebo (N =98). Additional smaller gabapentin dosage groups (600 mg/day, N=53; 1800 mg/day, N=54) were also studied for information regarding dose response. Responder rate was higher in the gabapentin 1200 mg/day group (16%) than in the placebo group (8%), but the difference was not statistically significant. The responder rate at 600 mg (17%) was also not significantly higher than in the placebo, but the responder rate in the 1800 mg group (26%) was statistically significantly superior to the placebo rate. Response ratio was better in the gabapentin 1200 mg/day group (-0.103) than in the placebo group (-0.022); but this difference was also not statistically significant (p = 0.224). A better response was seen in the gabapentin 600 mg/day group (-0.105) and 1800 mg/day group (-0.222) than in the 1200 mg/day group, with the 1800 mg/day group achieving statistical significance compared to the placebo group.</p>
<p>A third study compared gabapentin 900 mg/day divided TID (N=111) and placebo (N=109). An additional gabapentin 1200 mg/day dosage group (N=52) provided dose-response data. A statistically significant difference in responder rate was seen in the gabapentin 900 mg/day group (22%) compared to that in the placebo group (10%). Response ratio was also statistically significantly superior in the gabapentin 900 mg/day group (-0.119) compared to that in the placebo group (-0.027), as was response ratio in 1200 mg/day gabapentin (-0.184) compared to placebo.</p>
<p>Analyses were also performed in each study to examine the effect of gabapentin on preventing secondarily generalized tonic-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4265182" conceptname="Clonic seizure">clonic seizures</span>. Patients who experienced a secondarily generalized tonic-clonic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> in either the baseline or in the treatment period in all three placebo-controlled studies were included in these analyses. There were several response ratio comparisons that showed a statistically significant advantage for gabapentin compared to placebo and favorable trends for almost all comparisons.</p>
<p>Analysis of responder rate using combined data from all three studies and all doses (N=162, gabapentin; N=89, placebo) also showed a significant advantage for gabapentin over placebo in reducing the frequency of secondarily generalized tonic-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4265182" conceptname="Clonic seizure">clonic seizures</span>.</p>
<p>In two of the three controlled studies, more than one dose of gabapentin was used. Within each study the results did not show a consistently increased response to dose. However, looking across studies, a trend toward increasing efficacy with increasing dose is evident (see <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>).</p>
<p><img alt="gabapentin-fig04" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=f40ce3e3-6277-4b90-8414-934c889720cd&amp;name=gabapentin-fig04.jpg"></p>
<p>In the figure, treatment effect magnitude, measured on the Y-axis in terms ofÂ  the difference in the proportion of gabapentin and placebo assigned patients attaining a 50% or greater reduction in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> frequency from baseline, is plotted against the daily dose of gabapentin administered (X axis).</p>
<p>Although no formal analysis by gender has been performed, estimates of response (Response Ratio) derived from clinical trials (398 men, 307 women) indicate no important gender differences exist. There was no consistent pattern indicating that age had any effect on the response to gabapentin. There were insufficient numbers of patients of races other than Caucasian to permit a comparison of efficacy among racial groups.</p>
<p>A fourth study in pediatric patients age 3 to 12 years compared 25 to 35 mg/kg/day gabapentin (N=118) with placebo (N = 127). For all <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106574" conceptname="Partial seizure">partial seizures</span> in the intent-to-treat population, the response ratio was statistically significantly better for the gabapentin group (-0.146) than for the placebo group (-0.079). For the same population, the responder rate for gabapentin (21 %) was not significantly different from placebo (18%).</p>
<p>A study in pediatric patients age 1 month to 3 years compared 40 mg/kg/day gabapentin (N=38) with placebo (N=38) in patients who were receiving at least one marketed antiepileptic drug and had at least one partial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> during the screening period (within 2 weeks prior to baseline).

There were no statistically significant differences between treatments in either the response ratio or responder rate.<br></p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322252" conceptname="Suicidal behavior">Suicidal Behavior</span> and Ideation</h2>
<p class="First">Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including gabapentin, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</p>
<p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322252" conceptname="Suicidal behavior">suicidal behavior</span> or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>.</p>
<p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</p>
<p>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. <a href="#table2">Table 2</a> shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</p>

<p>Anyone considering prescribing gabapentin or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">Epilepsy</span> and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior.

<p>Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm.

<h2>Neuropsychiatric Adverse Eventsâ€”Pediatric Patients 3 to 12 years of age</h2>
<p class="First">Gabapentin use in pediatric patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> 3 to 12 years of age is associated with the occurrence of central nervous system related adverse events. The most significant of these can be classified into the following categories: 1) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4078201" conceptname="Mood swings">emotional lability</span> (primarily behavioral problems), 2) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4195585" conceptname="Hostile behavior">hostility</span>, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021344" conceptname="Abusive behavior">aggressive behaviors</span>, 3) thought disorder, including concentration problems and change in school performance, and 4) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4195305" conceptname="Hyperactive behavior">hyperkinesia</span> (primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">restlessness</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">hyperactivity</span>). Among the gabapentin-treated patients, most of the events were mild to moderate in intensity.</p>
<p>In controlled trials in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, the incidence of these adverse events was: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4078201" conceptname="Mood swings">emotional lability</span> 6% (gabapentin-treated patients) vs 1.3% (placebo-treated patients); <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4195585" conceptname="Hostile behavior">hostility</span> 5.2% vs 1.3%; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4195305" conceptname="Hyperactive behavior">hyperkinesia</span> 4.7% vs 2.9%; and thought disorder 1.7% vs 0%. One of these events, a report of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4195585" conceptname="Hostile behavior">hostility</span>, was considered serious. Discontinuation of gabapentin treatment occurred in 1.3% of patients reporting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4078201" conceptname="Mood swings">emotional lability</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4195305" conceptname="Hyperactive behavior">hyperkinesia</span> and 0.9% of gabapentin-treated patients reporting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4195585" conceptname="Hostile behavior">hostility</span> and thought disorder.

Of these, 14 patients had no prior history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span> either before treatment or while on other medications.

<h2>Tumorigenic Potential</h2>
<p class="First">In standard preclinical <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> lifetime carcinogenicity studies, an unexpectedly high incidence of pancreatic acinar adenocarcinomas was identified in male, but not female, rats. (See <a href="#section_6.5">PRECAUTIONS: Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</a>). The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Clinical experience during gabapentin's premarketing development provides no direct means to assess its potential for inducing tumors in humans.</p>
<p>In clinical studies in adjunctive therapy in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> comprising 2085 patient-years of exposure in patients &gt; 12 years of age, new tumors were reported in 10 patients (2 breast, 3 brain, 2 lung, 1 adrenal, 1 non-Hodgkin's <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span>, 1 endometrial carcinoma <span class="Italics">in situ</span>), and preexisting tumors worsened in 11 patients (9 brain, 1 breast, 1 prostate) during or up to 2 years following discontinuation of gabapentin. Without knowledge of the background incidence and recurrence in a similar population not treated with gabapentin, it is impossible to know whether the incidence seen in this cohort is or is not affected by treatment.<br></p>

<p class="First">During the course of premarketing development of gabapentin 8 sudden and unexplained <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> were recorded among a cohort of 2203 patients treated (2103 patient-years of exposure).</p>

This represents an incidence of 0.0038 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> per patient-year. Although this rate exceeds that expected in a healthy population matched for age and sex, it is within the range of estimates for the incidence of sudden unexplained <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> not receiving gabapentin (ranging from 0.0005 for the general population of epileptics to 0.003 for a clinical trial population similar to that in the gabapentin program, to 0.005 for patients with refractory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>).

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Patients should be instructed to take gabapentin only as prescribed.</p>
<p>Patients, their caregivers, and families should be counseled that AEDs, including gabapentin, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised that gabapentin may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> and other symptoms and signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span>. Accordingly, they should be advised neither to drive a car nor to operate other complex machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on gabapentin to gauge whether or not it affects their mental and/or motor performance adversely.</p>
<p>Patients who require concomitant treatment with morphine may experience increases in gabapentin concentrations. Patients should be carefully observed for signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span>, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, and the dose of gabapentin or morphine should be reduced appropriately (see <a href="#section_6.3">Drug Interactions</a>).</p>
<p>Patients should be encouraged to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. To enroll, patients can call the toll free number 1-888-233-2334 (see <a href="#section_6.6">PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy section</a>).<br></p>

<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical trials data do not indicate that routine monitoring of clinical laboratory parameters is necessary for the safe use of gabapentin. The value of monitoring gabapentin blood concentrations has not been established. Gabapentin may be used in combination with other antiepileptic drugs without concern for alteration of the blood concentrations of gabapentin or of other antiepileptic drugs.<br></p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies were conducted to investigate the potential of gabapentin to inhibit the major cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4) that mediate drug and xenobiotic metabolism using isoform selective marker substrates and human liver microsomal preparations. Only at the highest concentration tested (171 mcg/mL; 1 mM) was a slight degree of inhibition (14% to 30%) of isoform CYP2A6 observed. No inhibition of any of the other isoforms tested was observed at gabapentin concentrations up to 171 mcg/mL (approximately 15 times the C<span class="Sub">max</span> at 3600 mg/day).</p>
<p>Gabapentin is not appreciably metabolized nor does it interfere with the metabolism of commonly coadministered antiepileptic drugs.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Gabapentin was given in the diet to mice at 200, 600, and 2000 mg/kg/day and to rats at 250, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg/day for 2 years. A statistically significant increase in the incidence of pancreatic acinar cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> and carcinomas was found in male rats receiving the high dose; the no-effect dose for the occurrence of carcinomas was 1000 mg/kg/day. Peak plasma concentrations of gabapentin in rats receiving the high dose of 2000 mg/kg were 10 times higher than plasma concentrations in humans receiving 3600 mg per day, and in rats receiving 1000 mg/kg/day peak plasma concentrations were 6.5 times higher than in humans receiving 3600 mg/day. The pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas did not affect survival, did not metastasize and were not locally invasive. The relevance of this finding to carcinogenic risk in humans is unclear.</p>
<p>Studies designed to investigate the mechanism of gabapentin-induced pancreatic carcinogenesis in rats indicate that gabapentin stimulates DNA synthesis in rat pancreatic acinar cells <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and, thus, may be acting as a tumor promoter by enhancing mitogenic activity. It is not known whether gabapentin has the ability to increase cell proliferation in other cell types or in other species, including humans.</p>
<p>Gabapentin did not demonstrate mutagenic or genotoxic potential in three <span class="Italics">i<span class="Italics">n vitro</span></span><span class="Italics"></span> and four <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> assays. It was negative in the Ames test and the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells; it did not produce significant increases in chromosomal aberrations in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> Chinese hamster lung cell assay; it was negative in the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> chromosomal aberration assay and in the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> micronucleus test in Chinese hamster bone marrow; it was negative in the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus assay; and it did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis in hepatocytes from rats given gabapentin.</p>
<p>No adverse effects on fertility or reproduction were observed in rats at doses up to 2000 mg/kg (approximately 5 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).<br></p>

<h2>Pregnancy</h2>
<p class="First">Pregnancy Category C: Gabapentin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rodents, causing delayed ossification of several bones in the skull, vertebrae, forelimbs, and hindlimbs. These effects occurred when pregnant mice received oral doses of 1000 or 3000 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis, or approximately 1 to 4 times the maximum dose of 3600 mg/day given to epileptic patients on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. The no-effect level was 500 mg/kg/day or approximately Â½ of the human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p>
<p>When rats were dosed prior to and during mating, and throughout gestation, pups from all dose groups (500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg/day) were affected. These doses are equivalent to less than approximately 1 to 5 times the maximum human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. There was an increased incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194408" conceptname="Hydroureter">hydroureter</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433811" conceptname="Hydronephrosis">hydronephrosis</span> in rats in a study of fertility and general reproductive performance at 2000 mg/kg/day with no effect at 1000 mg/kg/day, in a teratology study at 1500 mg/kg/day with no effect at 300 mg/kg/day, and in a perinatal and postnatal study at all doses studied (500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg/day). The doses at which the effects occurred are approximately 1 to 5 times the maximum human dose of 3600 mg/day on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis; the no-effect doses were approximately 3 times (Fertility and General Reproductive Performance study) and approximately equal to (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">Teratogenicity</span> study) the maximum human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. Other than <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194408" conceptname="Hydroureter">hydroureter</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433811" conceptname="Hydronephrosis">hydronephrosis</span>, the etiologies of which are unclear, the incidence of malformations was not increased compared to controls in offspring of mice, rats, or rabbits given doses up to 50 times (mice), 30 times (rats), and 25 times (rabbits) the human daily dose on a mg/kg basis, or 4 times (mice), 5 times (rats), or 8 times (rabbits) the human daily dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p>
<p>In a teratology study in rabbits, an increased incidence of postimplantation fetal loss occurred in dams exposed to 60, 300, and 1500 mg/kg/day, or less than approximately 1/4 to 8 times the maximum human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<p>To provide information regarding the effects of in utero exposure to gabapentin capsules, physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking gabapentin capsules enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/.<br></p>

<h2>Use in Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Gabapentin is secreted into human milk following oral administration. A nursed infant could be exposed to a maximum dose of approximately 1 mg/kg/day of gabapentin. Because the effect on the nursing infant is unknown, gabapentin should be used in women who are nursing only if the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.<br></p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">The total number of patients treated with gabapentin in controlled clinical trials in patients with postherpetic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373852" conceptname="Neuralgia">neuralgia</span> was 336, of which 102 (30%) were 65 to 74 years of age, and 168 (50%) were 75 years of age and older. There was a larger treatment effect in patients 75 years of age and older compared with younger patients who received the same dosage. Since gabapentin is almost exclusively eliminated by renal excretion, the larger treatment effect observed in patients â‰¥75 years may be a consequence of increased gabapentin exposure for a given dose that results from an age-related decrease in renal function. However, other factors cannot be excluded. The types and incidence of adverse events were similar across age groups except for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4094513" conceptname="Ankle edema">peripheral edema</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437584" conceptname="Ataxia">ataxia</span>, which tended to increase in incidence with age.</p>
<p>Clinical studies of gabapentin in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>
<p>This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and dose should be adjusted based on creatinine clearance values in these patients (see <a href="#section_2">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>, <a href="#section_7">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a>, and <a href="#section_10">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a> sections).<br></p>

The most commonly observed adverse events reported with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, not seen at an equal frequency among placebo-treated patients, were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440029" conceptname="Viral disease">viral infection</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4195585" conceptname="Hostile behavior">hostility</span> (see <a href="#section_5.2">WARNINGS, Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events</a>).</p>
<p>Approximately 7% of the 2074 patients &gt; 12 years of age and approximately 7% of the 449 pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age who received gabapentin in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event.

<h2>Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials</h2>
<p class="First"><a href="#table4">Table 4</a> lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin -treated patients &gt; 12 years of age with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. In these studies, either gabapentin or placebo was added to the patient's current antiepileptic drug therapy. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity.</p>
<p>The prescriber should be aware that these figures, obtained when gabapentin was added to concurrent antiepileptic drug therapy, cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied.</p>

<h2>Clinical Trials in Adults and Adolescents (Except Clinical Trials in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373852" conceptname="Neuralgia">Neuropathic Pain</span>)</h2>
<p class="First">Gabapentin has been administered to 4717 patients &gt; 12 years of age during all adjunctive therapy clinical trials (except clinical trials in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373852" conceptname="Neuralgia">neuropathic pain</span>), only some of which were placebo-controlled. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals having adverse events, similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies presented represent the proportion of the 4717 patients &gt; 12 years of age exposed to gabapentin who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving gabapentin. All reported events are included except those already listed in <a href="#table4">Table 4</a>, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug.</p>
<p>Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.</p>

The dose can subsequently be titrated up as needed for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relief to a daily dose of 1800 mg (divided TID). In clinical studies, efficacy was demonstrated over a range of doses from 1800 mg/day to 3600 mg/day with comparable effects across the dose range. Additional benefit of using doses greater than 1800 mg/day was not demonstrated.<br></p>

Further, because there are no significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interactions</span> among gabapentin and other commonly used antiepileptic drugs, the addition of gabapentin does not alter the plasma levels of these drugs appreciably.</p>
