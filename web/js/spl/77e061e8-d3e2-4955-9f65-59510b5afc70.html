<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Cefdinir capsules USP contain the active ingredient cefdinir monohydrate, an extended-spectrum, semisynthetic cephalosporin, for oral administration. Chemically, cefdinir USP is [6R-[6Î±, 7Î² (Z)]]-7-[[(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-(hydroxyimino)acetyl]amino]-3-ethenyl-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylic acid. Cefdinir monohydrate is a white to slightly brownish-yellow solid. It is slightly soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid and sparingly soluble in 0.1M pH 7 phosphate buffer. The empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">14</span>H<span class="Sub">13</span>N<span class="Sub">5</span>O<span class="Sub">5</span>S<span class="Sub">2</span>.H<span class="Sub">2</span>O and the molecular weight is 413.47. Cefdinir monohydrate has the structural formula shown below:</p>

<h4><span class="Italics">Oral Bioavailability:</span></h4>
<p class="First">Maximal plasma cefdinir concentrations occur 2 to 4 hours postdose following capsule or suspension administration. Plasma cefdinir concentrations increase with dose, but the increases are less than dose-proportional from 300 mgÂ (7 mg/kg) to 600 mg (14 mg/kg). Following administration of suspension to healthy adults, cefdinir bioavailability is 120% relative to capsules. Estimated bioavailability of cefdinir capsules is 21% following administration of a 300 mg capsule dose, and 16% following administration of a 600 mg capsule dose. Estimated absolute bioavailability of cefdinir suspension is 25%. Cefdinir oral suspension of 250 mg/5 mL strength was shown to be bioequivalent to the 125 mg/5 mL strength in healthy adults under fasting conditions.</p>

<h4><span class="Italics">Effect of Food:</span></h4>
<p class="First">The C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of cefdinir from the capsules are reduced by 16% and 10%, respectively, when given with a high-fat meal. In adults given the 250 mg/5 mL oral suspension with a high-fat meal, the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of cefdinir are reduced by 44% and 33%, respectively. The magnitude of these reductions is not likely to be clinically significant because the safety and efficacy studies of oral suspension in pediatric patients were conducted without regard to food intake. Therefore, cefdinir may be taken without regard to food.</p>

<h3>Metabolism and Excretion:</h3>
<p class="First">Cefdinir is not appreciably metabolized. Activity is primarily due to parent drug. Cefdinir is eliminated principally via renal excretion with a mean plasma elimination half-life (t<span class="Sub">Â½</span>) of 1.7 (Â±0.6) hours. In healthy subjects with normal renal function, renal clearance is 2 (Â±1) mL/min/kg, and apparent oral clearance is 11.6 (Â±6) and 15.5 (Â±5.4) mL/min/kg following doses of 300 and 600 mg, respectively. Mean percent of dose recovered unchanged in the urine following 300- and 600 mg doses is 18.4% (Â±6.4) and 11.6% (Â±4.6), respectively. Cefdinir clearance is reduced in patients with renal dysfunction (see <span class="Bold">Special Populations</span>: <span class="Italics"><a href="#CLINICAL_PHARMACOLOGY_PHARMACOKINETICS_Special_Populations_Patients_with_Renal_Insufficiency">Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span></a></span>).</p>
<p>Because renal excretion is the predominant pathway of elimination, dosage should be adjusted in patients with markedly compromised renal function or who are undergoing hemodialysis (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#DOSAGE_AND_ADMINISTRATION">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>

<p class="First">Cefdinir pharmacokinetics were investigated in 21 adult subjects with varying degrees of renal function. Decreases in cefdinir elimination rate, apparent oral clearance (CL/F), and renal clearance were approximately proportional to the reduction in creatinine clearance (CL<span class="Sub">cr</span>). As a result, plasma cefdinir concentrations were higher and persisted longer in subjects with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> than in those without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>. In subjects with CL<span class="Sub">cr</span> between 30 and 60 mL/min, C<span class="Sub">max</span> and t<span class="Sub">Â½</span> increased by approximately 2 fold and AUC by approximately 3 fold. In subjects with CL<span class="Sub">cr</span> &lt;30 mL/min, C<span class="Sub">max</span> increased by approximately 2 fold, t<span class="Sub">Â½</span> by approximately 5 fold, and AUC by approximately 6 fold.

<h4><span class="Italics">Hemodialysis:</span></h4>
<p class="First">Cefdinir pharmacokinetics were studied in 8 adult subjects undergoing hemodialysis. Dialysis (4 hours duration) removed 63% of cefdinir from the body and reduced apparent elimination t<span class="Sub">Â½</span> from 16 (Â±3.5) to 3.2 (Â±1.2) hours.

<h4><span class="Italics">Geriatric Patients:</span></h4>
<p class="First">The effect of age on cefdinir pharmacokinetics after a single 300 mg dose was evaluated in 32 subjects 19 to 91 years of age. Systemic exposure to cefdinir was substantially increased in older subjects (N=16), C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 44% and AUC by 86%. This increase was due to a reduction in cefdinir clearance. The apparent volume of distribution was also reduced, thus no appreciable alterations in apparent elimination t<span class="Sub">Â½</span> were observed (elderly: 2.2 Â± 0.6 hours vs young: 1.8 Â± 0.4 hours). Since cefdinir clearance has been shown to be primarily related to changes in renal function rather than age, elderly patients do not require dosage adjustment unless they have markedly compromised renal function (creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min, see <span class="Italics"><a href="#CLINICAL_PHARMACOLOGY_PHARMACOKINETICS_Special_Populations_Patients_with_Renal_Insufficiency">Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span></a></span>, above).</p>

<p>*The current absence of data on resistant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> precludes defining any results other than Susceptible. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">Strains</span> yielding MIC results suggestive of a nonsusceptible category should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.</p>

<p>For <span class="Italics">Streptococcus</span> spp:</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span> that are susceptible to penicillin (MIC 0.06 mcg/mL), or streptococci other than <span class="Italics">S. pneumoniae</span> that are susceptible to penicillinÂ  (MIC 0.12 mcg/mL), can be considered susceptible to cefdinir. Testing of cefdinir against penicillin-intermediate or penicillin-resistant isolates is not recommended. Reliable interpretive criteria for cefdinir are not available.</p>
<p>A report of Susceptible indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentration usually achievable. A report of Intermediate indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of Resistant indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable; other therapy should be selected.</p>
<p>Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of laboratory procedures. Standard cefdinir powder should provide the following MIC values:</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34072-9">
<a name="section-7.1"></a><p></p>
<h2><span class="Bold">General </span></h2>
<p class="First">Prescribing cefdinir in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432545" conceptname="Bacterial infectious disease">bacterial infection</span> or a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118659" conceptname="Prophylactic">prophylactic</span> indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p>
<p>As with other broad-spectrum antibiotics, prolonged treatment may result in the possible emergence and overgrowth of resistant organisms. Careful observation of the patient is essential. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4105019" conceptname="Superimposed infection">superinfection</span> occurs during therapy, appropriate alternative therapy should be administered.</p>
<p>Cefdinir, as with other broad-spectrum antimicrobials (antibiotics), should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4272488" conceptname="Colitis">colitis</span>.</p>
<p>In patients with transient or persistent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> (creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min), the total daily dose of cefdinir should be reduced because high and prolonged plasma concentrations of cefdinir can result following recommended doses (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#DOSAGE_AND_ADMINISTRATION">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34076-0">
<a name="section-7.2"></a><p></p>
<h2><span class="Bold">Information for Patients </span></h2>
<p class="First">Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including cefdinir should only be used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432545" conceptname="Bacterial infectious disease">bacterial infections</span>. They do not treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440029" conceptname="Viral disease">viral infections</span> (e.g., the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">common cold</span>). When cefdinir is prescribed to treat a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432545" conceptname="Bacterial infectious disease">bacterial infection</span>, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by cefdinir or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p>
<p>Antacids containing magnesium or aluminum interfere with the absorption of cefdinir. If this type of antacid is required during cefdinir therapy, cefdinir should be taken at leastÂ 2 hours before or after the antacid.</p>
<p>Iron supplements, including multivitamins that contain iron, interfere with the absorption of cefdinir. If iron supplements are required during cefdinir therapy, cefdinir should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the supplement.</p>
<p>Iron-fortified infant formula does not significantly interfere with the absorption of cefdinir.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">Diarrhea</span> is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443530" conceptname="Hematochezia">bloody stools</span> (with or without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194175" conceptname="Left upper quadrant pain">stomach cramps</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic.

<p class="First">(aluminum- or magnesium-containing): Concomitant administration of 300 mg cefdinir capsules with 30 mL Maalox<span class="Sup">Â®</span> TC suspension reduces the rate (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) and extent (AUC) of absorption by approximately 40%. Time to reach C<span class="Sub">max</span> is also prolonged by 1 hour. There are no significant effects on cefdinir pharmacokinetics if the antacid is administered 2 hours before or 2 hours after cefdinir.

<h3><span class="Bold">Iron Supplements and Foods Fortified With Iron:</span></h3>
<p class="First">Concomitant administration of cefdinir with a therapeutic iron supplement containing 60 mg of elemental iron (as FeSO<span class="Sub">4</span>) or vitamins supplemented with 10 mg of elemental iron reduced extent of absorption by 80% and 31%, respectively. If iron supplements are required during cefdinir therapy, cefdinir should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the supplement.</p>
<p>The effect of foods highly fortified with elemental iron (primarily iron-fortified breakfast cereals) on cefdinir absorption has not been studied.</p>
<p>Concomitantly administered iron-fortified infant formula (2.2 mg elemental iron/6 oz) has no significant effect on cefdinir pharmacokinetics.</p>
<p>There have been reports of reddish stools in patients receiving cefdinir. In many cases, patients were also receiving iron-containing products. The reddish color is due to the formation of a nonabsorbable complex between cefdinir or its breakdown products and iron in the gastrointestinal tract.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">The carcinogenic potential of cefdinir has not been evaluated. No mutagenic effects were seen in the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames) or point mutation assay at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase locus (HGPRT) in V79 Chinese hamster lung cells. No clastogenic effects were observed <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> in the structural chromosome aberration assay in V79 Chinese hamster lung cells or <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> in the micronucleus assay in mouse bone marrow. In rats, fertility and reproductive performance were not affected by cefdinir at oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (70 times the human dose based on mg/kg/day, 11 times based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day).</p>

No effects were observed on maternal reproductive parameters or offspring survival, development, behavior, or reproductive function.</p>
<p>There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p>

<p class="First">In clinical trials, 5093 adult and adolescent patients (3841 U.S. and 1252 non-U.S.) were treated with the recommended dose of cefdinir capsules (600 mg/day). Most adverse events were mild and self-limiting. No <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> or permanent disabilities were attributed to cefdinir.

<h2>Patients With <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span></h2>
<p class="First">For adult patients with creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min, the dose of cefdinir should be 300 mg given once daily.</p>
<p>Creatinine clearance is difficult to measure in outpatients. However, the following formula may be used to estimate creatinine clearance (CL<span class="Sub">cr</span>) in adult patients. For estimates to be valid, serum creatinine levels should reflect steady-state levels of renal function.</p>

<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (72) (serum creatinine)</p>
<p>Females:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â CL<span class="Sub">cr</span>Â = 0.85 x above value</p>
<p>where creatinine clearance is in mL/min, age is in years, weight is in kilograms, and serum creatinine is in  mg/dL<a name="footnote-reference-8" href="#footnote-8" class="Sup">6</a>.</p>
<p>The following formula may be used to estimate creatinine clearance in pediatric patients: </p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â CL<span class="Sub">cr</span>Â = K x <span class="Underline">body length or height</span></p>

<p>where K = 0.55 for pediatric patients older than 1 year<a name="footnote-reference-9" href="#footnote-9" class="Sup">7</a> and 0.45 for infants  (up toÂ 1 year)<a name="footnote-reference-10" href="#footnote-10" class="Sup">8</a>.</p>
<p>In the above equation, creatinine clearance is in mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>, body length or height is in centimeters, and serum creatinine is in mg/dL.</p>
<p>For pediatric patients with a creatinine clearance of &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>, the dose of cefdinir should be 7 mg/kg (up to 300 mg) given once daily.</p>
