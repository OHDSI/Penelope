<span class="Bold">Description</span><p>Epinephrine Injection, USP 1:1000 is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution. 
Each mL contains epinephrine 1 mg; sodium chloride 9 mg; sodium 
metabisulfite 0.9 mg added. May contain<br>hydrochloric acid for pH 
adjustment. The solution contains no bacteriostat or antimicrobial 
agent. It is administered by the following routes: intravenous, 
intracardiac (left ventricular chamber), via endotracheal tube into the 
bronchial tree, subcutaneous or intramuscular. Epinephrine, USP is a 
sympathomimetic (adrenergic) agent designated chemically as 
4-[1-hydroxy-2 (methylamino) ethyl]-1,2 benzenediol, a white, 
microcrystalline powder. It has the following structural formula:</p>

<span class="Bold">Clinical Pharmacology</span><p class="First">The actions of epinephrine resemble the effects of 
stimulation of adrenergic nerves. To a variable degree it acts on both 
alpha and beta receptor sites of sympathetic effector cells. Its most 
prominent actions are on the beta receptors of the heart, vascular and 
other smooth muscle. When given by rapid intravenous injection, it 
produces a rapid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="141693" conceptname="Elevated blood-pressure reading without diagnosis of hypertension">rise in blood pressure</span>, mainly systolic, by (1) direct 
stimulation of cardiac muscle which increases the strength of 
ventricular contraction, (2) increasing the heart rate and (3) 
constriction of the arterioles in the skin, mucosa and splanchnic areas 
of the circulation. When given by slow intravenous injection epinephrine
 usually produces only a moderate rise in systolic and a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> in 
diastolic pressure. Although some increase in pulse pressure occurs, 
there is usually no great elevation in mean blood pressure. Accordingly,
 the compensatory reflex mechanisms that come into play with a 
pronounced increase in blood pressure do not antagonize the direct 
cardiac actions of epinephrine as much as with catecholamines that have a
 predominant action on alpha receptors.<br>Total peripheral resistance 
decreases by action of epinephrine on beta receptors of the skeletal 
muscle vasculature and blood flow is thereby enhanced. Usually this 
vasodilator effect of the drug on the circulation predominates so that 
the modest rise in systolic pressure which follows slow injection or 
absorption is mainly the result of direct cardiac stimulation and 
increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span>. In some instances peripheral resistance is 
not altered or may even rise owing to a greater ratio of alpha to beta 
activity in different vascular areas. Epinephrine relaxes the smooth 
muscles of the bronchi and iris and is a physiologic antagonist of 
histamine. The drug also produces an increase in blood sugar and 
glycogenolysis in the liver. Intravenous injection produces an immediate
 and intensified response. Following intravenous injection epinephrine 
disappears rapidly from the blood stream. Epinephrine is rapidly 
inactivated in the body and is degraded by enzymes in the liver and 
other tissues. The large portion of injection doses is excreted in the 
urine as inactivated compounds. The remainder is excreted in the urine 
as unchanged or conjugated compounds.</p>

<span class="Bold">Contraindications</span><p class="First">Epinephrine is contraindicated in patients with known 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> to sympathomimetic amines, in patients with angle

 be used in patients anesthetized with agents such as cyclopropane or 
halothane as these may sensitize the heart to the arrhythmic action of 
sympathomimetic drugs. Addition of epinephrine to local anesthetics for 
injection of certain areas (e.g., fingers, toes, ears, etc.) is 
contraindicated because of danger that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137788" conceptname="Vascular constriction">vasoconstriction</span> may result in 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4032013" conceptname="Desquamation">sloughing</span> of tissue.<br>Except as diluted for admixture with local 
anesthetics to reduce absorption and prolong action, epinephrine should 
not ordinarily be used in those cases where vasopressor drugs may be<br>contraindicated,

Epinephrine may induce potentially serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmias</span> in 
patients not suffering from heart disease and in patients with organic 
heart disease or who are receiving drugs that sensitize the myocardium. 
Parenterally administered epinephrine initially may produce constriction
 of renal blood vessels and decrease urine formation. Epinephrine 
Injection, USP is subject to oxidation and should be protected against 
exposure to light and stored in light-resistant containers. Epinephrine 
is the preferred treatment for serious allergic or other emergency 
situations even though this product contains sodium metabisulfite, a 
sulfite that may in other products cause allergic-type reactions 
including anaphylactic symptoms or life-threatening or less severe 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatic</span> episodes in certain susceptible persons. The alternatives to 
using epinephrine in a life-threatening situation may not be 
satisfactory. The presence of a sulfite in this product should not deter
 administration of the drug for treatment of serious allergic or other 
emergency situations.</p>

<span class="Bold">Precautions</span><p class="First">Do not use the Injection if its color is pinkish or 
darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate. Do not 
administer unless solution is clear and container is intact. Discard 
unused portion. Although epinephrine can produce ventricular 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226399" conceptname="Fibrillation">fibrillation</span>, its actions in restoring electrical activity in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">asystole</span> 
and in enhancing defibrillation of the fibrillating ventricle are well 
documented. The drug, however, should be used with caution in patients 
with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437894" conceptname="Ventricular fibrillation">ventricular fibrillation</span>. Epinephrine should be used cautiously in 
patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142479" conceptname="Hyperthyroidism">hyperthyroidism</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> and<br><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmias</span>. 
All vasopressors should be used cautiously in patients taking monoamine 
oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. Epinephrine should not be administered 
concomitantly with other sympathomimetic drugs (such as isoproterenol) 
because of possible additive effects and increased toxicity. Combined 
effects may induce serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmias</span>. They may be administered
 alternately when the preceding effect of other such drugs has subsided.
 Administration of epinephrine to patients receiving cyclopropane or 
halogenated hydrocarbon general anesthetics such as halothane which 
sensitize the myocardium, may induce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmia</span>. (See 
CONTRAINDICATIONS.) When encountered, such <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span> may respond to 
administration of a beta-adrenergic blocking drug. Epinephrine also 
should be used cautiously with other drugs (e.g., digitalis glycosides) 
that sensitize the myocardium to the actions of<br>sympathomimetic 
agents. Diuretic agents may decrease vascular response to pressor drugs 
such as epinephrine. Epinephrine may antagonize the neuron blockade 
produced by guanethidine resulting in decreased antihypertensive effect 
and requiring increased dosage of the latter.<br><span class="Italics"></span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Pregnancy Category C</span>. Animal reproduction 
studies have not been conducted with epinephrine. It is also not known 
whether epinephrine can cause fetal harm when administered to a<br>pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Epinephrine should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.<br><span class="Italics"></span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Labor and Delivery.</span> Parenteral 
administration of epinephrine if used to support blood pressure during 
low or other spinal anesthesia for delivery can cause acceleration of 
fetal heart rate and<br>should not be used in obstetrics when maternal blood pressure exceeds 130/80. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS.)</p>

 Information        derived from diverse formulations, concentrations 
and usages reveals that lidocaine is        completely absorbed 
following parenteral administration, its rate of absorption depending,  
      for example, upon various factors such as the site of 
administration and the presence or        absence of a vasoconstrictor 
agent. Except for intravascular administration, the highest        blood
 levels are obtained following intercostal nerve block and the lowest 
after subcutaneous        administration.</p>
<p>The plasma binding of lidocaine is dependent on drug concentration, 
and the        fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. 
At concentrations of 1 to 4 mcg of        free base per mL, 60 to 80 
percent of lidocaine is protein bound. Binding is also dependent        
on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein.</p>
<p>Lidocaine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive        diffusion.</p>
<p>Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and 
unchanged drug        are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation 
includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring        hydroxylation, cleavage 
of the amide linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major        
pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites 
monoethylglycinexylidide and        glycinexylidide. The 
pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar  
      to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine. Approximately 90% of
 lidocaine administered is        excreted in the form of various 
metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The        primary
 metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2, 6-dimethylaniline.</p>
<p>The elimination half-life of lidocaine following an intravenous bolus
 injection is        typically 1.5 to 2.0 hours. Because of the rapid 
rate at which lidocaine is metabolized, any        condition that 
affects liver function may alter lidocaine kinetics. The half-life may 
be        prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction.
 Renal dysfunction does not        affect lidocaine kinetics but may 
increase the accumulation of metabolites.</p>
<p>Factors such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidosis</span> and the use of CNS stimulants and 
depressants affect the        CNS levels of lidocaine required to 
produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse        manifestations 
become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 
6.0        mcg free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood 
levels of 18-21 mcg/mL have been        shown to be threshold for 
convulsive activity.</p>

<span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Bold">General:</span><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of lidocaine depend on 
proper dosage, correct          technique, adequate precautions, and 
readiness for emergencies. Standard textbooks should          be 
consulted for specific techniques and precautions for various regional 
anesthetic          procedures.</p>
<p>Resuscitative equipment, oxygen, and other resuscitative drugs should be          available for immediate use. (See <span><span class="Emphasis">WARNINGS</span></span> and <span><span class="Emphasis">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span></span>).
 The lowest dosage that results in effective anesthesia should be used 
to avoid          high plasma levels and serious adverse effects. 
Syringe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspirations</span> should also be          performed before and during 
each supplemental injection when using indwelling catheter          
techniques. During the administration of epidural anesthesia, it is 
recommended that a test          dose be administered initially and that
 the patient be monitored for central nervous system          toxicity 
and cardiovascular toxicity, as well as for signs of unintended 
intrathecal          administration before proceeding. When clinical 
conditions permit, consideration should be          given to employing 
local anesthetic solutions that contain epinephrine for the test dose   
       because circulatory changes compatible with epinephrine may also 
serve as a warning sign of          unintended intravascular injection. 
An intravascular injection is still possible even if          
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspirations</span> for blood are negative. Repeated doses of lidocaine may 
cause significant          increases in blood levels with each repeated 
dose because of slow accumulation of the drug          or its 
metabolites. Tolerance to elevated blood levels varies with the status 
of the          patient. Debilitated, elderly patients, acutely ill 
patients and children should be given          reduced doses 
commensurate with their age and physical condition. Lidocaine should 
also be          used with caution in patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span> or 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316135" conceptname="Atrioventricular block">heart block</span>. Lumbar and caudal epidural          anesthesia should be 
used with extreme caution in persons with the following conditions:     
     existing neurological disease, spinal deformities, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="132797" conceptname="Sepsis">septicemia</span> and 
severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>.</p>
<p>Local anesthetic solutions containing a vasoconstrictor should be 
used cautiously          and in carefully circumscribed quantities in 
areas of the body supplied by end arteries or          having otherwise 
compromised blood supply. Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321052" conceptname="Peripheral vascular disease">peripheral vascular disease</span> and 
         those with hypertensive vascular disease may exhibit 
exaggerated vasoconstrictor response.          Ischemic injury or 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280654" conceptname="Necrosis">necrosis</span> may result. Preparations containing a vasoconstrictor should be
          used with caution in patients during or following the

<p>Careful and constant monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory 
(adequacy of          ventilation) vital signs and the patient’s state

 central nervous system toxicity.</p>
<p>Since amide-type local anesthetics are metabolized by the liver, 
lidocaine should          be used with caution in patients with hepatic 
disease. Patients with severe hepatic          disease, because of their
 inability to metabolize local anesthetics normally, are at          
greater risk of developing toxic plasma concentrations. Lidocaine should
 also be used with          caution in patients with impaired 
cardiovascular function since they may be less able to          
compensate for functional changes associated with the prolongation of 
A-V conduction          produced by these drugs. Many drugs used during 
the conduct of anesthesia are considered          potential triggering 
agents for familial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440285" conceptname="Malignant hyperthermia">malignant hyperthermia</span>. Since it is not known       
   whether amide-type local anesthetics may trigger this reaction and 
since the need for          supplemental general anesthesia cannot be 
predicted in advance, it is suggested that a          standard protocol 
for the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440285" conceptname="Malignant hyperthermia">malignant hyperthermia</span> should be available. Early 
         unexplained signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317376" conceptname="Tachypnea">tachypnea</span>, labile blood 
pressure and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span>          may precede temperature 
elevation. Successful outcome is dependent on early diagnosis,          
prompt discontinuance of the suspect triggering agent(s) and institution
 of treatment,          including oxygen therapy, indicated supportive 
measures and dantrolene (consult dantrolene          sodium intravenous 
package insert before using).</p>
<p>Proper tourniquet technique, as described in publications and 
standard textbooks,          is essential in the performance of 
intravenous regional anesthesia. Solutions containing          
epinephrine or other vasoconstrictors should not be used for this 
technique.</p>
<p>Lidocaine should be used with caution in persons with known drug 
sensitivities.          Patients allergic to para-aminobenzoic acid 
derivatives (procaine, tetracaine, benzocaine,          etc.) have not 
shown cross sensitivity to lidocaine.</p>

          Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at doses up 
to 6.6 times the human dose          and have revealed no evidence of 
harm to the fetus caused by lidocaine. There are, however,          no 
adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal 
reproduction studies are          not always predictive of human 
response. General consideration should be given to this fact          
before administering lidocaine to women of childbearing potential, 
especially during early          pregnancy when maximum organogenesis 
takes place.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Labor and Delivery:<p>Local anesthetics rapidly cross the placenta and when 
used for epidural,          paracervical, pudendal or caudal block 
anesthesia, can cause varying degrees of maternal,          fetal and 
neonatal toxicity (See <span><span class="Emphasis">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span></span>—<span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Pharmacokinetics</span></span>).
 The potential          for toxicity depends upon the procedure 
performed, the type and amount of drug used, and          the technique 
of drug administration. Adverse reactions in the parturient, fetus and  
        neonate involve alterations of the central nervous system 
peripheral vascular tone and          cardiac function.</p>
<p>Maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> has resulted from regional anesthesia. Local 
anesthetics          produce vasodilation by blocking sympathetic 
nerves. Elevating the patient’s          legs and positioning her on her
 left side will help prevent decreases in blood pressure.          The 
fetal heart rate also should be monitored continuously, and electronic 
fetal monitoring          is highly advisable.</p>
<p>Epidural, spinal, paracervical, or pudendal anesthesia may alter the 
forces of          parturition through changes in uterine contractility 
or maternal expulsive efforts. In one          study, paracervical block
 anesthesia was associated with a decrease in the mean duration of      
    first stage labor and facilitation of cervical dilation. However, 
spinal and epidural          anesthesia have also been reported to 
prolong the second stage of labor by removing the          parturient’s 
reflex urge to bear down or by interfering with motor function. The     
     use of obstetrical anesthesia may increase the need for forceps 
assistance.</p>
<p>The use of some local anesthetic drug products during labor and 
delivery may be          followed by diminished muscle strength and tone
 for the first day or two of life. The          long-term significance 
of these observations is unknown. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314749" conceptname="Fetal bradycardia">Fetal bradycardia</span> may occur in 20     
     to 30 percent of patients receiving paracervical nerve block

associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4344632" conceptname="Fetal acidosis">fetal acidosis</span>. Fetal heart rate should always

          importance in obstetrical paracervical block. Failure to

 suspicion of intravascular or fetal intracranial injection.          
Cases compatible with unintended fetal intracranial injection of local

paracervical or pudendal block or both. Babies so          affected 
present with unexplained neonatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> at birth, which correlates

following use of          some local anesthetics for paracervical block

<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Neurologic:</span></span> The

administered and are also dependent upon the particular drug used, the 
route of        administration and the physical status of the patient. 
In a prospective review of 10,440        patients who received lidocaine
 for spinal anesthesia, the incidences of adverse reactions        were 
reported to be about 3 percent each for positional <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headaches</span>,

to local        anesthetic techniques, with or without a contribution 
from the local anesthetic.</p>
<p>In the practice of caudal or lumbar epidural block, occasional 
unintentional        penetration of the subarachnoid space by the 
catheter may occur. Subsequent adverse effects        may depend 
partially on the amount of drug administered subdurally.</p>
<p>These may include spinal block of varying magnitude (including total 
spinal block),        <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> secondary to spinal block, loss of 
bladder and bowel control, and loss of        perineal sensation and 
sexual function. Persistent motor, sensory and/or autonomic (sphincter  
      control) deficit of some lower spinal segments with slow recovery 
(several months) or        incomplete recovery have been reported in 
rare instances when caudal or lumbar epidural block        has been

<span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span><p class="First">Acute emergencies from local anesthetics are generally 
related to high plasma levels encountered during therapeutic use of 
local anesthetics or to unintended subarachnoid injection of local 
anesthetic solution (see<span><span class="Emphasis"> ADVERSE REACTIONS, </span></span><span><span class="Emphasis">WARNINGS</span></span> and <span><span class="Emphasis">PRECAUTIONS</span></span>).</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Management of Local Anesthetic Emergencies:</span></span>
 The first consideration is prevention, best accomplished by careful 
monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory vital signs and the 
patient’s state of consciousness after each local anesthetic injection. 
At the first sign of change, oxygen should be administered.</p>
<p>The first step in the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>, as well as 
underventilation or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span> due to unintended subarachnoid injection of 
drug solution, consists of immediate attention to the maintenance of a 
patent airway and assisted or controlled ventilation with oxygen and a 
delivery system capable of permitting immediate positive airway pressure
 by mask. Immediately after the institution of these ventilatory 
measures, the adequacy of the circulation should be evaluated, keeping 
in mind that drugs used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> sometimes depress the 
circulation when administered intravenously. Should <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> persist 
despite adequate respiratory support, and if the status of the 
circulation permits, small increments of an ultra-short acting 
barbiturate (such as thiopental or thiamylal) or a benzodiazepine (such 
as diazepam) may be administered intravenously. The clinician should be 
familiar, prior to use of local anesthetics, with these anticonvulsant 
drugs. Supportive treatment of circulatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> may require 
administration of intravenous fluids and, when appropriate, a 
vasopressor as directed by the clinical situation (e.g., ephedrine).</p>
<p>If not treated immediately, both <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> and cardiovascular 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> can result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span> and
 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span>. Underventilation or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span> due to unintentional 
subarachnoid injection of local anesthetic solution may produce these 
same signs and also lead to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span> if ventilatory support is not
 instituted. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span> should occur standard cardiopulmonary 
resuscitative measures should be instituted.</p>
<p>Endotracheal intubation, employing drugs and techniques familiar to 
the clinician, may be indicated, after initial administration of oxygen 
by mask, if difficulty is encountered in the maintenance of a patent 
airway or if prolonged ventilatory support (assisted or controlled) is 
indicated.</p>
<p>Dialysis is of negligible value in the treatment of acute overdosage with lidocaine.</p>
<p>The oral LD<span class="Sub">50</span> of lidocaine HCl in non-fasted
 female rats is 459 (346−773) mg/kg (as the salt) and 214 (159−324) 
mg/kg (as the salt) in fasted female rats.</p>

<span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span><p class="First">Table 1 (Recommended Dosages) summarizes the 
recommended volumes and concentrations of Lidocaine Hydrochloride 
Injection, USP for various types of anesthetic procedures. The dosages 
suggested in this table are for normal healthy adults and refer to the 
use of epinephrine-free solutions. When larger volumes are required only
 solutions containing epinephrine should be used, except in those cases 
where vasopressor drugs may be contraindicated.</p>
<p>There have been adverse event reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span> in patients 
receiving intra-articular infusions of local anesthetics following 
arthroscopic and other surgical procedures.  Lidocaine is not approved 
for this use (see <span><span class="Emphasis">WARNINGS</span></span> and <span><span class="Emphasis">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span></span>).</p>
<p>These recommended doses serve only as a guide to the amount of 
anesthetic required for most routine procedures. The actual volumes and 
concentrations to be used depend on a number of factors such as type and
 extent of surgical procedure, depth of anesthesia and degree of 
muscular relaxation required, duration of anesthesia required, and the 
physical condition of the patient. In all cases the lowest concentration
 and smallest dose that will produce the desired result should be given.
 Dosages should be reduced for children and for elderly and debilitated 
patients and patients with cardiac and/or liver disease.</p>
<p>The onset of anesthesia, the duration of anesthesia and the degree of
 muscular relaxation are proportional to the volume and concentration 
(i.e., total dose) of local anesthetic used. Thus, an increase in volume
 and concentration of Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection will decrease 
the onset of anesthesia, prolong the duration of anesthesia, provide a 
greater degree of muscular relaxation and increase the segmental spread 
of anesthesia. However, increasing the volume and concentration of 
Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection may result in a more profound <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> in 
blood pressure when used in epidural anesthesia. Although the incidence 
of side effects with lidocaine is quite low, caution should be exercised
 when employing large volumes and concentrations, since the incidence of
 side effects is directly proportional to the total dose of local 
anesthetic agent injected.</p>
<p>For intravenous regional anesthesia, only the 50 mL single-dose vial 
containing 0.5% Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection, USP should be used.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Epidural Anesthesia</span></span></p>
<p>For epidural anesthesia, only the following <span class="Underline"><span class="Emphasis">available</span></span> specific products of Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection by Hospira are recommended:</p>
<p>1%. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30 mL single-dose teartop vials</p>
<p>1.5%. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20 mL single-dose ampuls</p>
<p>2%. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 mL single-dose ampuls</p>
<p>Although these solutions are intended specifically for epidural 
anesthesia, they may also be used for infiltration and peripheral nerve 
block provided they are employed as single dose units. These solutions 
contain no bacteriostatic agent. In epidural anesthesia, the dosage 
varies with the number of dermatomes to be anesthetized (generally 2−3 
mL of the indicated concentration per dermatome).</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Caudal and Lumbar Epidural Block:</span></span>
 As a precaution against the adverse experiences sometimes observed 
following unintentional penetration of the subarachnoid space, a test 
dose such as 2−3 mL of 1.5% lidocaine hydrochloride should be 
administered at least 5 minutes prior to injecting the total volume 
required for a lumbar or caudal epidural block. The test dose should be 
repeated if the patient is moved in a manner that may have displaced the
 catheter. Epinephrine, if contained in the test dose (10−15 mcg have 
been suggested), may serve as a warning of unintentional intravascular 
injection. If injected into a blood vessel, this amount of epinephrine 
is likely to produce a transient "epinephrine response" within 45 
seconds, consisting of an increase in heart rate and systolic blood 
pressure, circumoral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260836" conceptname="Blanching of skin">pallor</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315078" conceptname="Palpitations">palpitations</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436817" conceptname="Feeling nervous">nervousness</span> in the 
unsedated patient. The sedated patient may exhibit only a pulse rate 
increase of 20 or more beats per minute for 15 or more seconds. Patients
 on beta-blockers may not manifest changes in heart rate, but blood 
pressure monitoring can detect an evanescent rise in systolic blood 
pressure. Adequate time should be allowed for onset of anesthesia after 
administration of each test dose. The rapid injection of a large volume 
of Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection through the catheter should be 
avoided, and, when feasible, fractional doses should be administered.</p>
<p>In the event of the known injection of a large volume of local 
anesthetic solutions into the subarachnoid space, after suitable 
resuscitation and if the catheter is in place, consider attempting the 
recovery of drug by draining a moderate amount of cerebrospinal fluid 
(such as 10 mL) through the epidural catheter.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Maximum Recommended Dosages</span></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">NOTE: The products accompanying this insert do not contain epinephrine.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Adults:</span></span> For 
normal healthy adults, the individual maximum recommended dose of 
lidocaine HCl with epinephrine should not exceed 7 mg/kg (3.5 mg/lb) of 
body weight and in general it is recommended that the maximum total dose
 not exceed 500 mg. When used without epinephrine, the maximum 
individual dose should not exceed 4.5 mg/kg (2 mg/lb) of body weight and
 in general it is recommended that the maximum total dose does not 
exceed 300 mg. For continuous epidural or caudal anesthesia, the maximum
 recommended dosage should not be administered at intervals of less than
 90 minutes. When continuous lumbar or caudal epidural anesthesia is 
used for non-obstetrical procedures, more drug may be administered if 
required to produce adequate anesthesia.</p>
<p>The maximum recommended dose per 90 minute period of lidocaine 
hydrochloride for paracervical block in obstetrical patients and 
non-obstetrical patients is 200 mg total. One-half of the total dose is 
usually administered to each side. Inject slowly five minutes between 
sides. (See also discussion of paracervical block in <span><span class="Emphasis">PRECAUTIONS</span></span>).</p>
<p>For intravenous regional anesthesia, the dose administered should not exceed 4 mg/kg in adults.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Children:</span></span> It is 
difficult to recommend a maximum dose of any drug for children, since 
this varies as a function of age and weight. For children over 3 years 
of age who have a normal lean body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> and normal body development, the
 maximum dose is determined by the child’s age and weight. For example, 
in a child of 5 years weighing 50 lbs., the dose of lidocaine HCl should
 not exceed 75 — 100 mg (1.5 — 2 mg/lb). The use of even more dilute 
solutions (i.e., 0.25 — 0.5%) and total dosages not to exceed 3 mg/kg 
(1.4 mg/lb) are recommended for induction of intravenous regional 
anesthesia in children.</p>
<p>In order to guard against systemic toxicity, the lowest effective 
concentration and lowest effective dose should be used at all times. In 
some cases it will be necessary to dilute available concentrations with 
0.9% sodium chloride injection in order to obtain the required final 
concentration.</p>
<p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate
 matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever the solution 
and container permit. Solutions that are discolored and/or contain 
particulate matter should not be used. </p>

<div class="Figure"><img alt="bupivacaine in dextrose figure 3" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=331f6960-a09d-4513-9e6b-a03527d9131e&amp;name=bupivacaine%20in%20dextrose%20figure%203.jpg"></div>
<p>Bupivacaine Spinal (Bupivacaine in Dextrose Injection, USP) is 
available in sterile, hyperbaric solution for subarachnoid injection 
(spinal block).</p>
<p>Bupivacaine hydrochloride is related chemically and pharmacologically
 to the aminoacyl local anesthetics. It is a homologue of mepivacaine 
and is chemically related to lidocaine. All three of these anesthetics 
contain an amide linkage between the aromatic nucleus and the amino or 
piperidine group. They differ in this respect from the procaine-type 
local anesthetics, which have an ester linkage.</p>
<p>Each 1 mL of Bupivacaine Spinal contains 7.5 mg bupivacaine 
hydrochloride, anhydrous and 82.5 mg dextrose, anhydrous. The pH of this
 solution is adjusted to 5.5 (4.0 to 6.5) with sodium hydroxide and/or 
hydrochloric acid.</p>
<p>The specific gravity of Bupivacaine Spinal is between 1.030 and 1.035 at 25°C and 1.03 at 37°C.</p>
<p>Bupivacaine Spinal does not contain any preservatives.</p>
<p>Solutions of bupivacaine hydrochloride may be autoclaved if they do not contain epinephrine.</p>

<a name="section-24"></a><p></p>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY<p class="First">Local anesthetics block the generation and the 
conduction of nerve impulses, presumably by increasing the threshold for
 electrical excitation in the nerve, by slowing the propagation of the 
nerve impulse and by reducing the rate of rise of the action potential. 
In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, 
myelination and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers. 
Clinically, the order of loss of nerve function is as follows: (1) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>,
 (2) temperature, (3) touch, (4) proprioception and (5) skeletal muscle 
tone.</p>
<p>Systemic absorption of local anesthetics produces effects on the 
cardiovascular and central nervous system (CNS). At blood concentrations
 achieved with normal therapeutic doses, changes in cardiac conduction, 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">excitability</span>, refractoriness, contractility, and peripheral vascular 
resistance are minimal. However, toxic blood concentrations depress 
cardiac conduction and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">excitability</span>, which may lead to atrioventricular 
block, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span>, sometimes resulting 
in fatalities. In addition, myocardial contractility is depressed and 
peripheral vasodilation occurs, leading to decreased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span> and 
arterial blood pressure. Recent clinical reports and animal research 
suggest that these cardiovascular changes are more likely to occur after
 unintended direct intravascular injection of bupivacaine. Therefore, 
when epidural anesthesia with bupivacaine is considered, incremental 
dosing is necessary.</p>
<p>Following systemic absorption, local anesthetics can produce central 
nervous system stimulation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> or both. Apparent central 
stimulation is manifested as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">restlessness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremors</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4190045" conceptname="Rigor">shivering</span>, 
progressing to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>, followed by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span> progressing 
ultimately to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317109" conceptname="Respiratory arrest">respiratory arrest</span>. However, the local anesthetics have a 
primary depressant effect on the medulla and on higher centers. The 
depressed stage may occur without a prior excited stage.</p>
<p><span><span class="Emphasis">Pharmacokinetics:</span></span>
 The rate of systemic absorption of local anesthetics is dependent upon 
the total dose and concentration of drug administered, the route of 
administration, the vascularity of the administration site, and the 
presence or absence of epinephrine in the anesthetic solution. A dilute 
concentration of epinephrine (1:200,000 or 5 μg/mL) usually reduces the 
rate of absorption and peak plasma concentration of bupivacaine, 
permitting the use of moderately larger total doses and sometimes 
prolonging the duration of action.</p>
<p>The onset of action with bupivacaine is rapid and anesthesia is 
long-lasting. The duration of anesthesia is significantly longer with 
bupivacaine than with any other commonly used local anesthetic. It has 
also been noted that there is a period of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> that persists after 
the return of sensation, during which time the need for strong 
analgesics is reduced.</p>
<p>The onset of sensory blockade following spinal block with Bupivacaine
 Spinal (bupivacaine in dextrose injection, USP) is very rapid (within 
one minute), maximum motor blockade and maximum dermatome level are 
achieved within 15 minutes in most cases. Duration of sensory blockade 
(time to return of complete sensation in the operative site or 
regression of two dermatomes) following a 12 mg dose averages 2 hours 
with or without 0.2 mg epinephrine. The time to return of complete motor
 ability with 12 mg Bupivacaine Spinal (bupivacaine in dextrose 
injection, USP) averages 3½ hours without the addition of epinephrine 
and 4½ hours if 0.2 mg epinephrine is added. When compared to equal 
milligram doses of hyperbaric tetracaine, the duration of sensory 
blockade was the same but the time to complete motor recovery was 
significantly longer for tetracaine. Addition of 0.2 mg epinephrine 
significantly prolongs the motor blockade and time to first 
postoperative narcotic with Bupivacaine Spinal (bupivacaine in dextrose 
injection, USP).</p>
<p>Local anesthetics appear to cross the placenta by passive diffusion. 
The rate and degree of diffusion is governed by (1) the degree of plasma
 protein binding, (2) the degree of ionization, and (3) the degree of 
lipid solubility. Fetal/maternal ratios of local anesthetics appear to 
be inversely related to the degree of plasma protein binding, because 
only the free, unbound drug is available for placental transfer. 
Bupivacaine with a high protein binding capacity (95%) has a low 
fetal/maternal ratio (0.2 to 0.4). The extent of placental transfer is 
also determined by the degree of ionization and lipid solubility of the 
drug. Lipid soluble, nonionized drugs readily enter the fetal blood from
 the maternal circulation.</p>
<p>Depending upon the route of administration, local anesthetics are 
distributed to some extent to all body tissues, with high concentrations
 found in highly perfused organs such as the liver, lungs, heart and 
brain.</p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic studies on the plasma profiles of bupivacaine after 
direct intravenous injection suggest a three-compartment open model. The
 first compartment is represented by the rapid intravascular 
distribution of the drug. The second compartment represents the 
equilibration of the drug throughout the highly perfused organs such as 
the brain, myocardium, lungs, kidneys and liver. The third compartment 
represents an equilibration of the drug with poorly perfused tissues, 
such as muscle and fat. The elimination of drug from tissue distribution
 depends largely upon the ability of binding sites in the circulation to
 carry it to the liver where it is metabolized.</p>
<p>Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local anesthetics can be 
significantly altered by the presence of hepatic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>, 
addition of epinephrine, factors affecting urinary pH, renal blood flow,
 the route of drug administration, and the age of the patient. The 
half-life of bupivacaine in adults is 3.5 ± 2 hours and in neonates 8.1 
hours.</p>
<p>Amide-type local anesthetics such as bupivacaine are metabolized 
primarily in the liver via conjugation with glucuronic acid. Patients 
with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span>, especially those with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span>, may 
be more susceptible to the potential toxicities of the amide-type local 
anesthetics. Pipecoloxylidine is the major metabolite of bupivacaine.</p>
<p>The kidney is the main excretory organ for most local anesthetics and
 their metabolites. Urinary excretion is affected by renal perfusion and
 factors affecting urinary pH. Only 5% of bupivacaine is excreted 
unchanged in the urine.</p>
<p>When administered in recommended doses and concentrations, 
bupivacaine does not ordinarily produce irritation or tissue damage and 
does not cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">methemoglobinemia</span>.</p>

 DELAY IN PROPER MANAGEMENT OF DOSE-RELATED TOXICITY, UNDERVENTILATION 
FROM ANY CAUSE AND/OR ALTERED SENSITIVITY MAY LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF
 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">ACIDOSIS</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">CARDIAC ARREST</span>, AND, POSSIBLY, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">DEATH</span>.</p>
<p>Intra-articular infusions of local anesthetics following arthroscopic
 and other surgical procedures is an unapproved use, and there have been
 post-marketing reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span> in patients receiving such 
infusions. The majority of reported cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span> have involved 
the shoulder joint; cases of gleno-humeral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span> have been 
described in pediatric and adult patients following intra-articular 
infusions of local anesthetics with and without epinephrine for periods 
of 48 to 72 hours. There is insufficient information to determine 
whether shorter infusion periods are not associated with these findings.
 The time of onset of symptoms, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77074" conceptname="Joint pain">joint pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4060220" conceptname="Stiff neck">stiffness</span> and loss 
of motion can be variable, but may begin as early as the 2nd month after
 surgery. Currently, there is no effective treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span>; 
patients who experienced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span> have required additional 
diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and some required arthroplasty or 
shoulder replacement.</p>
<p>Spinal anesthetics should not be injected during uterine 
contractions, because spinal fluid current may carry the drug further 
cephalad than desired.</p>
<p>A free flow of cerebrospinal fluid during the performance of spinal 
anesthesia is indicative of entry into the subarachnoid space. However, 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span> should be performed before the anesthetic solution is 
injected to confirm entry into the subarachnoid space and to avoid 
intravascular injection.</p>
<p>Bupivacaine solutions containing epinephrine or other vasopressors 
should not be used concomitantly with ergot-type oxytocic drugs, because
 a severe persistent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> may occur. Likewise, solutions of 
bupivacaine containing a vasoconstrictor, such as epinephrine, should be
 used with extreme caution in patients receiving monoamine oxidase 
inhibitors (MAOI) or antidepressants of the triptyline or imipramine 
types, because severe prolonged <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> may result.</p>
<p>Until further experience is gained in patients younger than 18 years,
 administration of bupivacaine in this age group is not recommended.</p>
<p>Mixing or the prior or intercurrent use of any other local anesthetic
 with bupivacaine cannot be recommended because of insufficient data on 
the clinical use of such mixtures.</p>

<a name="section-28"></a><p></p>PRECAUTIONS<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>General:<p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of spinal anesthetics 
depend on proper dosage, correct technique, adequate precautions and 
readiness for emergencies. Resuscitative equipment, oxygen and other 
resuscitative drugs should be available for immediate use. (See <span><span class="Emphasis">WARNINGS</span></span>, <span><span class="Emphasis">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span></span> and <span><span class="Emphasis">OVERDOSAGE</span></span>.)
 The patient should have I.V. fluids running via an indwelling catheter 
to assure a functioning intravenous pathway. The lowest dosage of local 
anesthetic that results in effective anesthesia should be used. 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">Aspiration</span> for blood should be performed before injection and injection 
should be made slowly. Tolerance varies with the status of the patient. 
Debilitated, elderly patients and acutely ill patients may require 
reduced doses. Reduced doses may also be indicated in patients with 
increased intra-abdominal pressure (including obstetrical patients), if 
otherwise suitable for spinal anesthesia.</p>
<p>There should be careful and constant monitoring of cardiovascular and
 respiratory (adequacy of ventilation) vital signs and the patient’s 
state of consciousness after local anesthetic injection. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">Restlessness</span>,

the mouth and lips, metallic taste, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377575" conceptname="Tinnitus">tinnitus</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079185" conceptname="Hazy vision">blurred vision</span>,
 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremors</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> may be early warning signs of central
 nervous system toxicity.</p>
<p>Spinal anesthetics should be used with caution in patients with severe disturbances of cardiac rhythm, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316135" conceptname="Atrioventricular block">heart block</span>.</p>
<p>Sympathetic blockade occurring during spinal anesthesia may result in
 peripheral vasodilation and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, the extent depending on the 
number of dermatomes blocked. Blood pressure should, therefore, be 
carefully monitored especially in the early phases of anesthesia. 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> may be controlled by vasoconstrictors in dosages depending 
on the severity of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> and response of treatment. The level of 
anesthesia should be carefully monitored because it is not always 
controllable in spinal techniques.</p>
<p>Because amide-type local anesthetics such as bupivacaine are 
metabolized by the liver, these drugs, especially repeat doses, should 
be used cautiously in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span>. Patients with 
severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span>, because of their inability to metabolize local 
anesthetics normally, are at a greater risk of developing toxic plasma 
concentrations. Local anesthetics should also be used with caution in 
patients with impaired cardiovascular function because they may be less 
able to compensate for functional changes associated with the 
prolongation of AV conduction produced by these drugs. However, dosage 
recommendations for spinal anesthesia are much lower than dosage 
recommendations for other major blocks and most experience regarding 
hepatic and cardiovascular disease dose-related toxicity is derived from
 these other major blocks.</p>
<p>Serious dose-related <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmias</span> may occur if preparations 
containing a vasoconstrictor such as epinephrine are employed in 
patients during or following the administration of potent inhalation 
agents. In deciding whether to use these products concurrently in the 
same patient, the combined action of both agents upon the myocardium, 
the concentration and volume of vasoconstrictor used, and the time since
 injection, when applicable, should be taken into account.</p>
<p>Many drugs used during the conduct of anesthesia are considered 
potential triggering agents for familial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440285" conceptname="Malignant hyperthermia">malignant hyperthermia</span>. Because
 it is not known whether amide-type local anesthetics may trigger this 
reaction and because the need for supplemental general anesthesia cannot
 be predicted in advance, it is suggested that a standard protocol for 
management should be available. Early unexplained signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317376" conceptname="Tachypnea">tachypnea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4354255" conceptname="Labile blood pressure">labile blood pressure</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span> may precede 
temperature elevation. Successful outcome is dependent on early 
diagnosis, prompt discontinuance of the suspect triggering agent(s) and 
prompt institution of treatment, including oxygen therapy, indicated 
supportive measures, and dantrolene. (Consult dantrolene sodium 
intravenous package insert before using.)</p>
<p>The following conditions may preclude the use of spinal anesthesia,

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Information for Patients:<p>When appropriate, patients should be informed in 
advance that they may experience temporary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4141128" conceptname="Absence of sensation">loss of sensation</span> and motor 
activity, usually in the lower half of the body, following proper 
administration of spinal anesthesia. Also, when appropriate, the 
physician should discuss other information including adverse reactions 
in the Bupivacaine Spinal (Bupivacaine in Dextrose Injection, USP) 
package insert.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Clinically Significant Drug Interactions:<p>The administration of local anesthetic solutions 
containing epinephrine or norepinephrine to patients receiving monoamine
 oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants may produce severe, 
prolonged <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>. Concurrent use of these agents should generally 
be avoided. In situations when concurrent therapy is necessary, careful 
patient monitoring is essential.</p>
<p>Concurrent administration of vasopressor drugs and of ergot-type 
oxytocic drugs may cause severe persistent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> or 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">cerebrovascular accidents</span>.</p>
<p>Phenothiazines and butyrophenones may reduce or reverse the pressor effect of epinephrine.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility:<p>Long-term studies in animals of most local anesthetics 
including bupivacaine to evaluate the carcinogenic potential have not 
been conducted. Mutagenic potential or the effect on fertility have not 
been determined. There is no evidence from human data that Bupivacaine 
Spinal (Bupivacaine in Dextrose Injection, USP) may be carcinogenic or 
mutagenic or that it impairs fertility.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pregnancy Category C:<p>Decreased pup survival in rats and an embryocidal 
effect in rabbits have been observed when bupivacaine hydrochloride was 
administered to these species in doses comparable to 230 and 130 times 
respectively the maximum recommended human spinal dose. There are no 
adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women of the effect of 
bupivacaine on the developing fetus. Bupivacaine hydrochloride should be
 used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the 
potential risk to the fetus. This does not exclude the use of 
Bupivacaine Spinal at term for obstetrical anesthesia. (See <span><span class="Emphasis">Labor and Delivery</span></span>.)</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Labor and Delivery:<p>Spinal anesthesia has a recognized use during labor and
 delivery. Bupivacaine hydrochloride, when administered properly, via 
the epidural route in doses 10 to 12 times the amount used in spinal 
anesthesia has been used for obstetrical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> and anesthesia 
without evidence of adverse effects on the fetus.</p>
<p>Maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> has resulted from regional anesthesia. Local 
anesthetics produce vasodilation by blocking sympathetic nerves. 
Elevating the patient’s legs and positioning her on her left side will 
help prevent decreases in blood pressure. The fetal heart rate also 
should be monitored continuously and electronic fetal monitoring is 
highly advisable.</p>
<p>It is extremely important to avoid aortocaval compression by the 
gravid uterus during administration of regional block to parturients. To
 do this, the patient must be maintained in the left lateral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4127794" conceptname="Decubitus">decubitus</span> 
position or a blanket roll or sandbag may be placed beneath the right 
hip and the gravid uterus displaced to the left.</p>
<p>Spinal anesthesia may alter the forces of parturition through changes
 in uterine contractility or maternal expulsive efforts. Spinal 
anesthesia has also been reported to prolong the second stage of labor 
by removing the parturient’s reflex urge to bear down or by interfering 
with motor function. The use of obstetrical anesthesia may increase the 
need for forceps assistance.</p>
<p>The use of some local anesthetic drug products during labor and 
delivery may be followed by diminished muscle strength and tone for the 
first day or two of life. This has not been reported with bupivacaine.</p>
<p>There have been reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span> during use of bupivacaine 
hydrochloride 0.75% solution for epidural anesthesia in obstetrical 
patients. The package insert for bupivacaine hydrochloride for epidural,
 nerve block, etc. has a more complete discussion of preparation for, 
and management of, this problem. These cases are compatible with 
systemic toxicity following unintended intravascular injection of the 
much larger dose recommended for epidural anesthesia and have not 
occurred within the dose range of bupivacaine hydrochloride 0.75% 
recommended for spinal anesthesia in obstetrics. The 0.75% concentration
 of bupivacaine hydrochloride is therefore not recommended for 
obstetrical epidural anesthesia. Bupivacaine Spinal (bupivacaine in 
dextrose injection, USP) is recommended for spinal anesthesia in 
obstetrics.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Nursing Mothers:<p>It is not known whether local anesthetic drugs are 
excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, 
caution should be exercised when local anesthetic drugs are administered
 to a nursing woman.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pediatric Use:<p>Until further experience is gained in patients younger 
than 18 years, administration of Bupivacaine Spinal in this age group is
 not recommended.</p>

<a name="section-29"></a><p></p>ADVERSE REACTIONS<p class="First">Reactions to bupivacaine are characteristic of those associated with other amide-type local anesthetics.</p>
<p>The most commonly encountered acute adverse experiences which demand 
immediate countermeasures following the administration of spinal 
anesthesia are <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> due to loss of sympathetic tone and 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275136" conceptname="Paralysis of diaphragm">respiratory paralysis</span> or underventilation due to cephalad extension of 
the motor level of anesthesia. These may lead to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span> if 
untreated. In addition, dose-related <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> and cardiovascular 
collapse may result from diminished tolerance, rapid absorption from the
 injection site or from unintentional intravascular injection of a local
 anesthetic solution. Factors influencing plasma protein binding, such 
as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidosis</span>, systemic diseases which alter protein production, or 
competition of other drugs for protein binding sites, may diminish 
individual tolerance.</p>
<p><span><span class="Emphasis">Respiratory System:</span></span>
 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275136" conceptname="Paralysis of diaphragm">Respiratory paralysis</span> or underventilation may be noted as a result of 
upward extension of the level of spinal anesthesia and may lead to 
secondary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxic</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span> if untreated. Preanesthetic medication,
 intraoperative analgesics and sedatives, as well as surgical 
manipulation, may contribute to underventilation. This will usually be 
noted within minutes of the injection of spinal anesthetic solution, but
 because of differing surgical maximal onset times, differing 
intercurrent drug usage and differing manipulation, it may occur at any 
time during surgery or the immediate recovery period.</p>
<p><span><span class="Emphasis">Cardiovascular System:</span></span>
 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> due to loss of sympathetic tone is a commonly encountered 
extension of the clinical pharmacology of spinal anesthesia. This is 
more commonly observed in patients with shrunken blood volume, shrunken 
interstitial fluid volume, cephalad spread of the local anesthetic, 
and/or mechanical obstruction of venous return. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">Nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> are 
frequently associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotensive episodes</span> following the 
administration of spinal anesthesia. High doses, or inadvertent 
intravascular injection, may lead to high plasma levels and related 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> of the myocardium, decreased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>,

 The incidences of adverse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4204047" conceptname="Neurological symptom">neurologic reactions</span> associated with the use

<a name="section-30"></a><p></p>OVERDOSAGE<p class="First">Acute emergencies from local anesthetics are generally 
related to high plasma levels encountered during therapeutic use or to 
underventilation (and perhaps <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span>) secondary to upward extension of 
spinal anesthesia. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> is commonly encountered during the 
conduct of spinal anesthesia due to relaxation of sympathetic tone, and 
sometimes, contributory mechanical obstruction of venous return.</p>
<p><span><span class="Emphasis">Management of Local Anesthetic Emergencies:</span></span>
 The first consideration is prevention, best accomplished by careful and
 constant monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory vital signs and 
the patient’s state of consciousness after each local anesthetic 
injection. At the first sign of change, oxygen should be administered.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">The first step in the 
management of systemic toxic reactions, as well as underventilation or 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span> due to a high or total spinal, consists of </span></span><span><span class="Emphasis">immediate</span></span><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">
 attention to the establishment and maintenance of a patent airway and 
effective assisted or controlled ventilation with 100% oxygen with a 
delivery system capable of permitting immediate positive airway pressure
 by mask.</span></span> This may prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> if they have not already occurred.</p>
<p>If necessary, use drugs to control the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>. A 50 mg to 100 mg
 bolus I.V. injection of succinylcholine will paralyze the patient 
without depressing the central nervous or cardiovascular systems and 
facilitate ventilation. A bolus I.V. dose of 5 mg to 10 mg of diazepam 
or 50 mg to 100 mg of thiopental will permit ventilation and counteract 
central nervous system stimulation, but these drugs also depress central
 nervous system, respiratory and cardiac function, add to postictal 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and may result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span>. Intravenous barbiturates, 
anticonvulsant agents, or muscle relaxants should only be administered 
by those familiar with their use. Immediately after the institution of 
these ventilatory measures, the adequacy of the circulation should be 
evaluated. Supportive treatment of circulatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> may require 
administration of intravenous fluids, and, when appropriate, a 
vasopressor dictated by the clinical situation (such as ephedrine or 
epinephrine to enhance myocardial contractile force).</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> due to sympathetic relaxation may be managed by giving 
intravenous fluids (such as Sodium Chloride Injection 0.9% or Lactated 
Ringer’s Injection), in an attempt to relieve mechanical obstruction of 
venous return, or by using vasopressors (such as ephedrine which 
increases the force of myocardial contractions) and, if indicated, by 
giving plasma expanders or whole blood.</p>
<p>Endotracheal intubation, employing drugs and techniques familiar to 
the clinician, may be indicated, after initial administration of oxygen 
by mask if difficulty is encountered in the maintenance of a patent 
airway, or if prolonged ventilatory support (assisted or controlled) is 
indicated.</p>
<p>Recent clinical data from patients experiencing local

required, the duration of anesthesia desired, individual tolerance, and 
the physical condition of the patient. The smallest dose and 
concentration required to produce the desired result should be 
administered. Dosages of Bupivacaine Spinal (Bupivacaine in Dextrose 
Injection, USP) should be reduced for elderly and debilitated patients 
and patients with cardiac and/or liver disease.</p>
<p>For specific techniques and procedures, refer to standard textbooks.</p>
<p>There have been adverse event reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span> in patients 
receiving intra-articular infusions of local anesthetics following

approved for this use (see <span><span class="Emphasis">WARNINGS </span></span>and <span><span class="Emphasis">DOSAGE </span></span><span><span class="Emphasis">AND ADMINISTRATION</span></span>).</p>
<p>The extent and degree of spinal anesthesia depends upon several 
factors including dosage, specific gravity of the anesthetic solution, 
volume of solution used, force of injection, level of puncture, and 
position of the patient during and immediately after injection.</p>
<p>Seven and one-half mg (7.5 mg or 1.0 mL) Bupivacaine Spinal has 
generally proven satisfactory for spinal anesthesia for lower extremity 
and perineal procedures including TURP and vaginal hysterectomy. Twelve 
mg (12 mg or 1.6 mL) has been used for lower abdominal procedures such 
as abdominal hysterectomy, tubal ligation, and appendectomy. These doses
 are recommended as a guide for use in the average adult and may be 
reduced for elderly or debilitated patients. Because experience with 
Bupivacaine Spinal is limited in patients below the age of 18 years, 
dosage recommendations in this age group cannot be made.</p>
<p><span><span class="Emphasis">Obstetrical Use:</span></span>
 Doses as low as 6 mg bupivacaine hydrochloride have been used for 
vaginal delivery under spinal anesthesia. The dose range of 7.5 mg to 
10.5 mg (1 mL to 1.4 mL) bupivacaine hydrochloride has been used for 
Cesarean section under spinal anesthesia.</p>
<p>In recommended doses, Bupivacaine Spinal produces complete motor and sensory block.</p>
<p>Unused portions of solutions should be discarded following initial use.</p>
<p>Bupivacaine Spinal should be inspected visually for discoloration and

<a name="section-35"></a><p></p>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Mechanism of action:</span></span>
 Lidocaine stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic 
fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby 
effecting local anesthetic action.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Onset and duration of anesthesia:</span></span>
 The onset of action is rapid. The duration of perineal anesthesia 
provided by 1 mL (50 mg) 5% Lidocaine Hydrochloride and 7.5% Dextrose 
Injection, USP averages 100 minutes, with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> continuing for an 
additional 40 minutes. The duration of surgical anesthesia provided by 
1.5 to 2 mL (75 to 100 mg) of this agent is approximately two hours.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Hemodynamics:</span></span> 
Excessive blood levels may cause changes in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span>, total 
peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. With central neural 
blockade these changes may be attributable to block of autonomic fibers,
 or a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various 
components of the cardiovascular system. The net effect is normally a 
modest <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> when the recommended dosages are not exceeded.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Pharmacokinetics and metabolism:</span></span>
 Information derived from diverse formulations, concentrations and 
usages reveals that lidocaine is completely absorbed following 
parenteral administration, its rate of absorption depending, for 
example, upon various factors such as the site of administration and the
 presence or absence of a vasoconstrictor agent. Except for 
intravascular administration, the highest blood levels are obtained 
following intercostal nerve block and the lowest after subcutaneous 
administration.</p>
<p>The plasma binding of lidocaine is dependent on drug concentration, 
and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At 
concentrations of 1 to 4 mcg of free base per mL, 60 to 80 percent of 
lidocaine is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma 
concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein.</p>
<p>Lidocaine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion.</p>
<p>Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and 
unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes 
oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide 
linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of 
biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and 
glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these 
metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine. 
Approximately 90% of lidocaine administered is excreted in the form of 
various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The 
primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 
4-hydroxy-2,6-dimethylaniline.</p>
<p>The elimination half-life of lidocaine following an intravenous bolus
 injection is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at 
which lidocaine is metabolized, any condition that affects liver 
function may alter lidocaine kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged 
two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction 
does not affect lidocaine kinetics but may increase the accumulation of 
metabolites.</p>
<p>Factors such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidosis</span> and the use of CNS stimulants and 
depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine required to produce overt
 systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly 
apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6.0 mcg free base 
per mL. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18 to 21 mcg/mL 
have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity.</p>

<p>To avoid intravascular injection, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span> should be performed

<a name="section-39"></a><p></p>PRECAUTIONS<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>General:<p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of lidocaine depend on 
proper dosage, correct technique, adequate precautions, and readiness 
for emergencies. Standard textbooks should be consulted for specific 
techniques and precautions for spinal anesthetic procedures. 
Resuscitative equipment, oxygen and other resuscitative drugs should be 
available for immediate use. (See <span><span class="Emphasis">WARNINGS</span></span> and <span><span class="Emphasis">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span></span>.)
 The lowest dosage that results in effective anesthesia should be used 
to avoid high plasma levels and serious adverse effects. Repeated doses 
of lidocaine may cause significant increases in blood levels with each 
repeated dose because of slow accumulation of the drug or its 
metabolites. Tolerance to elevated blood levels varies with the physical
 condition of the patient. Debilitated, elderly patients, acutely ill 
patients and children should be given reduced doses commensurate with 
their age and physical status. Lidocaine should also be used with 
caution in patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316135" conceptname="Atrioventricular block">heart block</span>.</p>
<p>Neurologic deficits have been reported with the use of small bore 
needles and microcatheters for spinal anesthesia. It has been 
postulated, based on <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">in vitro</span></span>
 models, that these deficits were due to pooling and non-uniform 
distribution of concentrated local anesthesia within the subarachnoid 
space.<span class="Sup">1</span>Animal studies suggest mixing of 5%

<p>Since amide-type local anesthetics are metabolized by the liver, 
lidocaine should be used with caution in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span>. 
Patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span>, because of their inability to 
metabolize local anesthetic normally, are a greater risk of developing 
toxic plasma concentrations. Lidocaine should also be used with caution 
in patients with impaired cardiovascular function since they may be less
 able to compensate for functional changes associated with the 
prolongation of A-V conduction produced by these drugs.</p>
<p>Many drugs used during the conduct of anesthesia are considered

measures and dantrolene (consult dantrolene sodium intravenous package 
insert before using).</p>
<p>Lidocaine should be used with caution in persons with known drug 
sensitivities. Patients allergic to para-aminobenzoic acid derivatives 
(procaine, tetracaine, benzocaine, etc.) have not shown cross 
sensitivity to lidocaine.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Information for Patients:<p>When appropriate, patients should be informed in

<p>Concurrent administration of vasopressor drugs (for the treatment of 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> related to spinal blocks) and ergot-type oxytocic drugs may

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility:<p>Studies of lidocaine in animals to evaluate the

<p>Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at doses up to 6.6 
times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus 
caused by lidocaine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled
 studies in pregnant women. Animal reproduction studies are not always 
predictive of human response. General consideration should be given to 
this fact before administering lidocaine to women of childbearing 
potential, especially during early pregnancy when maximum organogenesis 
takes place.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Labor and delivery:<p>Maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> has resulted from regional 
anesthesia. Local anesthetics produce vasodilation by blocking 
sympathetic nerves. Elevating the patient’s legs and positioning her on 
her left side will help prevent decreases in blood pressure. The fetal 
heart rate also should be monitored continuously, and electronic fetal 
monitoring is highly advisable.</p>
<p>Spinal anesthesia may alter the forces of parturition through changes
 in uterine contractility or maternal expulsive efforts. However, spinal
 anesthesia has also been reported to prolong the second stage of labor 
by removing the parturient’s reflex urge to bear down or by interfering 
with motor function. The use of obstetrical anesthesia may increase the 
need for forceps assistance.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Nursing mothers:<p>It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human

related to high plasma levels encountered during therapeutic use of 
local anesthetics or to unintended subarachnoid injection of local 
anesthetic solution (see <span><span class="Emphasis">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span></span>, <span><span class="Emphasis">WARNINGS</span></span>, and <span><span class="Emphasis">PRECAUTIONS</span></span>).</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Management of local anesthetic emergencies:</span></span>
 The first consideration is prevention, best accomplished by careful and
 constant monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory vital signs and 
the patient’s state of consciousness after each local anesthetic 
injection. At the first sign of change, oxygen should be administered.</p>
<p>The first step in the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>, as well as 
underventilation or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span> due to excessive cephalad spread of the spinal
 block, consists of immediate attention to the maintenance of a patent 
airway and assisted or controlled ventilation with oxygen and a delivery
 system capable of permitting immediate positive airway pressure by 
mask. Immediately after the institution of these ventilatory measures, 
the adequacy of the circulation should be evaluated, keeping in mind 
that drugs used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> sometimes depress the circulation 
when administered intravenously. Should <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> persist despite 
adequate respiratory support, and if the status of the circulation 
permits, small increments of an ultra-short acting barbiturate (such as 
thiopental or thiamylal) or a benzodiazepine (such as diazepam) may be 
administered intravenously. The clinician should be familiar, prior to 
use of local anesthetics, with these anticonvulsant drugs. Supportive 
treatment of circulatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> may require administration of 
intravenous fluids and, when appropriate, a vasopressor as directed by 
the clinical situation (e.g., ephedrine).</p>
<p>If not treated immediately, both <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> and cardiovascular 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> can result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span> and

<p>Endotracheal intubation, employing drugs and techniques familiar to 
the clinician, may be indicated, after initial administration of oxygen 
by mask, if difficulty is encountered in the maintenance of a patent 
airway or if prolonged ventilatory support (assisted or controlled) is 
indicated.</p>
<p>Dialysis is of negligible value in the treatment of acute overdosage with lidocaine.</p>
<p>The intravenous LD<span class="Sub">50</span> of lidocaine HCl in female mice is 26 (21 to 31) mg/kg and subcutaneous LD<span class="Sub">50</span> is 264 (203 to 304) mg/kg.</p>

<a name="section-42"></a><p></p>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION<p class="First">Spinal anesthesia with 5% Lidocaine Hydrochloride and 
7.5% Dextrose Injection, USP may be induced in the right or left lateral
 recumbent or the sitting position. Since this is a hyperbaric solution,
 the anesthetic will tend to move in the direction in which the table is
 tilted. After the desired level of anesthesia is obtained and the 
anesthetic has become fixed, usually in 5 to 10 minutes with lidocaine, 
the patient may be positioned according to the requirement of the 
surgeon or obstetrician.</p>
<p>In clinical trials, the safety of hyperbaric lidocaine for single 
injection spinal anesthesia was demonstrated using 22 or 25 gauge spinal
 needles. In these studies, free flow of CSF was visible before 
injection of lidocaine.</p>
<p>Neurologic deficits have been reported with the use of small bore 
needles and microcatheters for spinal anesthesia. It has been 
postulated, based on <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">in vitro</span></span>
 models, that these deficits were caused by pooling and non-uniform 
distribution of concentrated local anesthetic within the subarachnoid 
space.<span class="Sup">1</span> Animal studies suggest mixing of 5% 
lidocaine hydrochloride with an equal volume of CSF or preservative-free
 0.9% saline solution may reduce the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381732" conceptname="Nerve injury">nerve injury</span> due to pooling
 of concentrated local anesthetic.<span class="Sup">2</span> (See <span><span class="Emphasis">PRECAUTIONS</span></span>).</p>
<p>Intrathecal distribution of anesthetic may be facilitated by using a 
spinal needle of sufficient gauge to insure adequate withdrawal of CSF 
through the needle prior to and after anesthetic administration. If the 
technique is properly placed in the subarachnoid space, a separate 
injection is seldom necessary.</p>
<p>An incomplete or patchy block not responsive to patient repositioning
 may indicate misplacement or inadequate distribution of drug. To avoid 
excessive drug pooling, additional doses of lidocaine should not be 
administered with the same needle placement.</p>
<p>INJECTIONS SHOULD BE MADE SLOWLY. Consult standard textbooks for specific techniques for spinal anesthetic procedures.</p>
<p>There have been adverse event reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span> in patients

<p>Normal healthy adults: The following recommended dosages are for

<ul><li>at the end of the prep, discard any portion of the solution which is
 not required to cover the prep area. It is not necessary to use the 
entire amount available.
</li></ul>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Getting Patient Ready for Solution:
<ul>
<li>use in well-ventilated area
</li>
<li>do not microwave or heat the solution applicator
</li>
<li>apply to clean, completely dry, residue-free, intact skin
</li>
<li>when hair removal is necessary, use a surgical clipper on the 
morning of the surgery. If a wet shave is used, thoroughly remove all 
soap residues.
</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Activating the Applicator:
<ul>
<li>with sponge face parallel to the floor, press the cap end of the applicator. Solution will begin to flow into the sponge.
</li>
<li>wait for fluid level to reach indicator line of applicator barrel
</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>When Applying Solution:
<ul>
<li>
<span class="Bold">DO NOT SCRUB.</span> Paint a single, uniform application and do not reprep area.
</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">do not allow solution to pool.</span> Use sponge 
applicator to absorb excess solution and continue to apply a uniform 
coating. If solution accidentally gets outside of prep area, remove 
excess with gauze.
</li>
<li>clean umbilicus with enclosed swabs when applicable. (Moisten swabs by pressing against solution-soaked sponge applicator.)
</li>
<li>tuck prep towels as needed under both sides of the neck to absorb excess solution. Remove towels before draping.
</li>
<li>avoid getting solution into hairy areas. <span class="Bold">Wet hair is flammable.</span> Hair may take up to 1 hour to dry.
</li>
<li>when prepping skin folds, toes, or fingers, use a sterile-gloved 
hand to hold skin apart until completely dry. Otherwise, skin may adhere
 to itself.</li>

<br>After Solution is Completely Dry:
<ul>
<li>to reduce the risk of fire, begin draping and/or using cautery only 
after solution is completely dry and all solution-stained materials are 
removed
