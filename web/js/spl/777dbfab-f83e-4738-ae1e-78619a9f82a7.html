<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Neomycin sulfate is poorly absorbed from the normal gastrointestinal tract. The small absorbed fraction is rapidly distributed in the tissues and is excreted by the kidney in keeping with the degree of kidney function. The unabsorbed portion of the drug (approximately 97%) is eliminated unchanged in the feces.</p>
<p>Growth of most intestinal bacteria is rapidly suppressed following oral administration of neomycin sulfate, with the suppression persisting for 48 to 72 hours. Nonpathogenic yeasts and occasionally resistant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of <span class="Italics">Enterobacter aerogenes</span> (formerly <span class="Italics">Aerobacter aerogenes</span>) replace the intestinal bacteria.</p>
<p>As with other aminoglycosides, the amount of systemically absorbed neomycin transferred to the tissues increases cumulatively with each repeated dose administered until a steady state is achieved. The kidney functions as the primary excretory path as well as the tissue binding site, with the highest concentration found in the renal cortex. With repeated dosings, progressive accumulation also occurs in the inner ear. Release of tissue-bound neomycin occurs slowly over a period of several weeks after dosing has been discontinued.</p>
<p>Protein binding studies have shown that the degree of aminoglycoside protein binding is low and, depending upon the methods used for testing, this may be between 0% and 30%.</p>

<h2>Microbiology </h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> tests have demonstrated that neomycin is bactericidal and acts by inhibiting the synthesis of protein in susceptible bacterial cells. It is effective primarily against gram-negative bacilli but does have some activity against gram-positive organisms. Neomycin is active <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>against <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli </span>and the <span class="Italics">Klebsiella-Enterobacter </span>group. Neomycin is not active against anaerobic bowel flora.</p>
<p>If susceptibility testing is needed, using a 30 mcg disc, organisms producing zones of 16 mm or greater are considered susceptible. Resistant organisms produce zones of 13 mm or less. Zones greater than 13 mm and less than 16 mm indicate intermediate susceptibility.</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of neomycin sulfate tablets and other antibacterial drugs, neomycin sulfate tablets should be used only to treat or prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p>

<p>As with other antibiotics, use of oral neomycin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, particularly fungi. If this occurs, appropriate therapy should be instituted.</p>
<p>Neomycin is quickly and almost totally absorbed from body surfaces (except the urinary bladder) after local irrigation and when applied topically in association with surgical procedures. Delayed-onset irreversible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377889" conceptname="Hearing loss">deafness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">neuromuscular blockade</span> (regardless of the status of renal function) have been reported following irrigation of both small and large surgical fields with minute quantities of neomycin.</p>
<p>Cross-allergenicity among amino-glycosides has been demonstrated.</p>
<p>Aminoglycosides should be used with caution in patients with muscular disorders such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="76685" conceptname="Myasthenia gravis">myasthenia gravis</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4140090" conceptname="Parkinsonism">parkinsonism</span> since these drugs may aggravate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79908" conceptname="Muscle weakness">muscle weakness</span> because of their potential curare-like effect on the neuromuscular junction.</p>
<p>Small amounts of orally administered neomycin are absorbed through intact intestinal mucosa.</p>
<p>There have been many reports in the literature of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126119" conceptname="Toxic nephropathy">nephrotoxicity</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4236623" conceptname="Ototoxicity">ototoxicity</span> with oral use of neomycin.

<h2>Information for The Patient</h2>
<p class="First">Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including neomycin sulfate tablets should only be used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432545" conceptname="Bacterial infectious disease">bacterial infections</span>. They do not treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440029" conceptname="Viral disease">viral infections</span> (e.g., the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">common cold</span>). When neomycin sulfate tablets are prescribed to treat a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432545" conceptname="Bacterial infectious disease">bacterial infection</span>, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by neomycin sulfate tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p>
<p>Before administering the drug, patients or members of their families should be informed of possible toxic effects on the eighth nerve. The possibility of acute toxicity increases in premature infants and neonates.</p>

<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> may develop toxic neomycin blood levels unless doses are properly regulated. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> develops during treatment, the dosage should be reduced or the antibiotic discontinued. To avoid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126119" conceptname="Toxic nephropathy">nephrotoxicity</span> and eighth <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381732" conceptname="Nerve injury">nerve damage</span> associated with high doses and prolonged treatment, the following should be performed prior to and periodically during therapy: urinalysis for increased excretion of protein, decreased specific gravity, casts and cells; renal function tests such as serum creatinine, BUN or creatinine clearance; tests of the vestibulocochlearis nerve (eighth cranial nerve) function.</p>
<p>Serial, vestibular and audiometric tests should be performed (especially in high-risk patients). Since elderly patients may have reduced renal function which may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests such as BUN or serum creatinine, a creatinine clearance determination may be more useful.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Caution should be taken in concurrent or serial use of other neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic drugs because of possible enhancement of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126119" conceptname="Toxic nephropathy">nephrotoxicity</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4236623" conceptname="Ototoxicity">ototoxicity</span> of neomycin (see boxed <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p>
<p>Caution should also be taken in concurrent or serial use of other amino-glycosides and polymyxins because they may enhance neomycinâ€™s <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126119" conceptname="Toxic nephropathy">nephrotoxicity</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4236623" conceptname="Ototoxicity">ototoxicity</span> and potentiate neomycin sulfateâ€™s neuromuscular blocking effects.</p>
<p>Oral neomycin inhibits the gastrointestinal absorption of penicillin V, oral vitamin B-12, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil. The gastrointestinal absorption of digoxin also appears to be inhibited. Therefore, digoxin serum levels should be monitored.</p>
<p>Oral neomycin sulfate may enhance the effect of coumarin in anticoagulants by decreasing vitamin K availability.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">It is not known whether neomycin is excreted in human milk, but it has been shown to be excreted in cow milk following a single intramuscular injection. Other aminoglycosides have been shown to be excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from the aminoglycosides in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<p class="First">For use as an adjunct in the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377604" conceptname="Hepatic coma">hepatic coma</span>, the recommended dose is 4 to 12 grams per day given in the following regimen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Withdraw protein from diet. Avoid use of diuretic agents.</li>
<li>Give supportive therapy, including blood products, as indicated.</li>
<li>Give neomycin sulfate tablets in doses of 4 to 12 grams of neomycin sulfate per day (eight to 24 tablets) in divided doses. Treatment should be continued over a period of five to six days, during which time protein should be returned incrementally to the diet.</li>
<li>If less potentially toxic drugs cannot be used for chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic insufficiency</span>, neomycin in doses of up to four grams daily (eight tablets per day) may be necessary.
