<br><br><br><p>Plasma concentrations after the 600 mg dose, which were disproportionately higher (up to 30% greater than expected) than those found after the 300 mg dose, indicated that the elimination of larger doses was not as rapid.<br>After repeated once-a-day infusions (3 hr duration) of 600 mg in patients (n=5) for 7 days, concentrations of IV rifampin decreased from 5.81 Â± 3.38 mcg/mL 8 hours after the infusion on day 1 to 2.6 Â± 1.88 mcg/mL 8 hours after the infusion on day 7.<br>Rifampin is widely distributed throughout the body. It is present in effective concentrations in many organs and body fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid. Rifampin is about 80% protein bound. Most of the unbound fraction is not ionized and therefore diffuses freely into tissues.<br>Rifampin is rapidly eliminated in the bile and undergoes progressive enterohepatic circulation and deacetylation to the primary metabolite, 25-desacetyl-rifampin. This metabolite is microbiologically active. Less than 30% of the dose is excreted in the urine as rifampin or metabolites.

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">In the treatment of both <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span> and the meningococcal carrier state, the small number of resistant cells present within large populations of susceptible cells can rapidly become the predominant type. Bacteriologic cultures should be obtained before the start of therapy to confirm the susceptibility of the organism to rifampin and they should be repeated throughout therapy to monitor the response to treatment.Â  Since resistance can emerge rapidly, susceptibility tests should be performed in the event of persistent positive cultures during the course of treatment. If test results show resistance to rifampin and the patient is not responding to therapy, the drug regimen should be modified.</p>

The Advisory Council for the Elimination of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">Tuberculosis</span>, the American Thoracic Society, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that either streptomycin or ethambutol be added as a fourth drug in a regimen containing isoniazid (INH), rifampin, and pyrazinamide for initial treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span> unless the likelihood of INH resistance is very low. The need for a fourth drug should be reassessed when the results of susceptibility testing are known. If community rates of INH resistance are currently less than 4%, an initial treatment regimen with less than four drugs may be considered.<br>Following the initial phase, treatment should be continued with rifampin and isoniazid (e.g., RIFAMATE<span class="Sup">Â®</span>) for at least 4 months.

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<br><p class="First">Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including rifampin should only be used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432545" conceptname="Bacterial infectious disease">bacterial infections</span>.Â  They do not treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440029" conceptname="Viral disease">viral infections</span> (e.g., the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">common cold</span>).Â  When rifampin is prescribed to treat a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432545" conceptname="Bacterial infectious disease">bacterial infection</span>, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by rifampin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.<br><span class="Bold">The patient should be told that rifampin may produce a reddish coloration of the urine, sweat, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4102774" conceptname="Productive cough">sputum</span>, and tears, and the patient should be forewarned of this. </span>Soft contact lenses may be permanently stained.<br>The patient should be advised that the reliability of oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives may be affected; consideration should be given to using alternative contraceptive measures.<br>Patients should be instructed to take rifampin either 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal with a full glass of water.<br>Patients should be instructed to notify their physicians promptly if they experience any of the following: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, loss of appetite, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4272240" conceptname="Malaise">malaise</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, darkened urine, yellowish discoloration of the skin and eyes, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span> of the joints.<br>Compliance with the full course of therapy must be emphasized, and the importance of not missing any doses must be stressed.</p>

<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<br><p class="First">Adults treated for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span> with rifampin should have baseline measurements of hepatic enzymes, bilirubin, serum creatinine, a complete blood count, and a platelet count (or estimate). Baseline tests are unnecessary in pediatric patients unless a complicating condition is known or clinically suspected.<br>Patients should be seen at least monthly during therapy and should be specifically questioned concerning symptoms associated with adverse reactions. All patients with abnormalities should have follow-up, including laboratory testing, if necessary. Routine laboratory monitoring for toxicity in people with normal baseline measurements is generally not necessary.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<br><p class="First">Healthy subjects who received rifampin 600 mg once daily concomitantly with saquinavir 1000 mg/ritonavir 100 mg twice daily (ritonavir-boosted saquinavir) developed severe hepatocellular toxicity. Therefore, concomitant use of these medications is contraindicated. (See <a href="#Section_4">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>.)<br><br>Enzyme Induction: Rifampin is known to induce certain cytochrome P-450 enzymes. Administration of rifampin with drugs that undergo biotransformation through these metabolic pathways may accelerate elimination of coadministered drugs. To maintain optimum therapeutic blood levels, dosages of drugs metabolized by these enzymes may require adjustment when starting or stopping concomitantly administered rifampin.<br><br>Rifampin has been reported to substantially decrease the plasma concentrations of the following antiviral drugs: atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, saquinavir, and tipranavir. These antiviral drugs must not be co-administered with rifampin. (See <a href="#Section_4">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>.)<br><br>Rifampin has been reported to accelerate the metabolism of the following drugs: anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin), digitoxin, antiarrhythmics (e.g., disopyramide, mexiletine, quinidine, tocainide), oral anticoagulants, antifungals (e.g., fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole), barbiturates, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers (e.g., diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil), chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, corticosteroids, cyclosporine, cardiac glycoside preparations, clofibrate, oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives, dapsone, diazepam, doxycycline, fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin), haloperidol, oral hypoglycemic agents (sulfonylureas), levothyroxine, methadone, narcotic analgesics, progestins, quinine, tacrolimus, theophylline, tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline, nortriptyline) and zidovudine. It may be necessary to adjust the dosages of these drugs if they are given concurrently with rifampin.<br><br>Patients using oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives should be advised to change to nonhormonal methods of birth control during rifampin therapy.<br>Rifampin has been observed to increase the requirements for anticoagulant drugs of the coumarin type. In patients receiving anticoagulants and rifampin concurrently, it is recommended that the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time be performed daily or as frequently as necessary to establish and maintain the required dose of anticoagulant.<br>Other Interactions: When the two drugs were taken concomitantly, decreased concentrations of atovaquone and increased concentrations of rifampin were observed.<br>Concurrent use of ketoconazole and rifampin has resulted in decreased serum concentrations of both drugs. Concurrent use of rifampin and enalapril has resulted in decreased concentrations of enalaprilat, the active metabolite of enalapril. Dosage adjustments should be made if indicated by the patientâ€™s clinical condition.<br>Concomitant antacid administration may reduce the absorption of rifampin. Daily doses of rifampin should be given at least 1 hour before the ingestion of antacids.<br>Probenecid and cotrimoxazole have been reported to increase the blood level of rifampin.<br>When rifampin is given concomitantly with either halothane or isoniazid, the potential for hepatotoxicity is increased. The concomitant use of rifampin and halothane should be avoided. Patients receiving both rifampin and isoniazid should be monitored close for hepatotoxicity.<br>Plasma concentrations of sulfapyridine may be reduced following the concomitant administration of sulfasalazine and rifampin. This finding may be the result of alteration in the colonic bacteria responsible for the reduction of sulfasalazine to sulfapyridine and mesalamine.</p>

<h2>Drug/Laboratory Interactions</h2>
<br><p class="First">Cross-reactivity and false-positive urine screening tests for opiates have been reported in patients receiving rifampin when using the KIMS (Kinetic Interaction of Microparticles in Solution) method (e.g., Abuscreen OnLine opiates assay; Roche Diagnostic Systems). Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> spectrometry, will distinguish rifampin from opiates.<br><br>Therapeutic levels of rifampin have been shown to inhibit standard microbiological assays for serum folate and vitamin B12. Thus, alternate assay methods should be considered. Transient abnormalities in liver function tests (e.g., elevation in serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and serum transaminases) and reduced biliary excretion of contrast media used for visualization of the gallbladder have also been observed. Therefore, these tests should be performed before the morning dose of rifampin.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<br><p class="First">Rifampin for Injection should be administered by IV infusion (see <a href="#Section_3">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</a>). <br>See <a href="#Section_2">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a> for dosing information in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span>.<br><br><span class="Bold"><span class="Underline"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">Tuberculosis</span> </span></span><br>Adults: 10 mg/kg, in a single daily administration, not to exceed 600 mg/day, IV<br>Pediatric Patients: 10 to 20 mg/kg, not to exceed 600 mg/day, IV<br>Rifampin is indicated in the treatment of all forms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span>. A three-drug regimen consisting of rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide (e.g., RIFATER<span class="Sup">Â®</span>) is recommended in the initial phase of short-course therapy which is usually continued for 2 months. The Advisory Council for the Elimination of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">Tuberculosis</span>, the American Thoracic Society, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that either streptomycin or ethambutol be added as a fourth drug in a regimen containing isoniazid (INH), rifampin and pyrazinamide for initial treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span> unless the likelihood of INH resistance is very low. The need for a fourth drug should be reassessed when the results of susceptibility testing are known. If community rates of INH resistance are currently less than 4%, an initial treatment regimen with less than four drugs may be considered.<br>Following the initial phase, treatment should be continued with rifampin and isoniazid (e.g., RIFAMATE<span class="Sup">Â®</span>) for at least 4 months. Treatment should be continued for longer if the patient is still <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4102774" conceptname="Productive cough">sputum</span> or culture positive, if resistant organisms are present, or if the patient is HIV positive.<br><span class="Underline">Preparation of Solution for IV Infusion </span>: Reconstitute the lyophilized powder by transferring 10 mL of sterile water for injection to a vial containing 600 mg of rifampin for injection. Swirl vial gently to completely dissolve the antibiotic. The reconstituted solution contains 60 mg rifampin per mL and is stable at room temperature for 24 hours. Prior to administration, withdraw from the reconstituted solution a volume equivalent to the amount of rifampin calculated to be administered and add to 500 mL of infusion medium. Mix well and infuse at a rate allowing for complete infusion within 3 hours. Alternatively, the amount of rifampin calculated to be administered may be added to 100 mL of infusion medium and infused in 30 minutes.<br>Dilutions in dextrose 5% for injection (D5W) are stable at room temperature for up to 4 hours and should be prepared and used within this time. Precipitation of rifampin from the infusion solution may occur beyond this time. Dilutions in normal saline are stable at room temperature for up to 24 hours and should be prepared and used within this time. Other infusion solutions are not recommended.<br><span class="Underline">Incompatibilities </span>: Physical incompatibility (precipitate) was observed with undiluted (5 mg/mL) and diluted (1 mg/mL in normal saline) diltiazem hydrochloride and rifampin (6 mg/mL in normal saline) during simulated Y-site administration.<span class="Bold"><span class="Underline"><br><br>Meningococcal Carriers<br></span></span>Adults: For adults, it is recommended that 600 mg rifampin be administered twice daily for two days.<br>Pediatric Patients: Pediatric patients 1 month of age or older: 10 mg/kg (not to exceed 600 mg per dose) every 12 hours for two days.<br>Pediatric patients under 1 month of age: 5 mg/kg every 12 hours for two days.</p>
