<h1><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION</span></h1>
<p class="First">Pentoxifylline extended-release tablets, USP for oral administration contain 400 mg of the active drug and the following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol, and titanium dioxide in an extended-release formulation. Pentoxifylline is a tri-substituted xanthine derivative designated chemically as 3,7-Dihydro-3,7-dimethyl-1-(5-oxohexyl)-1H-purine-2,6-dione that, unlike theophylline, is a hemorrheologic agent, i.e., an agent that affects blood viscosity. Pentoxifylline is soluble in water and ethanol, and sparingly soluble in toluene. The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">13</span>H<span class="Sub">18</span>N<span class="Sub">4</span>O<span class="Sub">3</span> and its molecular weight is 278.31.</p>
<p>The chemical structure is:</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Mode of Action</span></h2>
<p class="First">Pentoxifylline and its metabolites improve the flow properties of blood by decreasing its viscosity. In patients with chronic peripheral arterial disease, this increases blood flow to the affected microcirculation and enhances tissue oxygenation. The precise mode of action of pentoxifylline and the sequence of events leading to clinical improvement are still to be defined. Pentoxifylline administration has been shown to produce dose-related  hemorrheologic effects, lowering blood viscosity, and improving erythrocyte flexibility. Leukocyte properties of hemorrheologic importance have been modified in animal and in vitro human studies. Pentoxifylline has been shown to increase leukocyte deformability and to inhibit neutrophil <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4175338" conceptname="Adhesion">adhesion</span> and activation. Tissue oxygen levels have been shown to be significantly increased by therapeutic doses of pentoxifylline in patients with peripheral arterial disease. </p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</span></h2>
<p class="First">After oral administration in aqueous solution pentoxifylline is almost completely absorbed. It undergoes a first-pass effect and the various metabolites appear in plasma very soon after dosing. Peak plasma levels of the parent compound and its metabolites are reached within 1 hour. The major metabolites are Metabolite 1(1-[5-hydroxyhexyl]-3,7-dimethylxanthine) and Metabolite V (1-[3-carboxypropyl]-3,7-dimethylxanthine), and plasma levels of these metabolites are 5 and 8 times greater, respectively, than pentoxifylline.</p>
<p>Following oral administration of aqueous solutions containing 100 to 400 mg of pentoxifylline, the pharmacokinetics of the parent compound and Metabolite 1 are dose-related and not proportional (non-linear), with half-life and area under the blood-level time curve (AUC) increasing with dose. The elimination kinetics of Metabolite V are not dose-dependent. The apparent plasma half-life of pentoxifylline varies from 0.4 to 0.8 hours and the apparent plasma half-lives of its metabolites vary from 1 to 1.6 hours. There is no evidence of accumulation or enzyme induction (Cytochrome P450) following multiple oral doses.</p>
<p>Excretion is almost totally urinary; the main biotransformation product is Metabolite V. Essentially no parent drug is found in the urine. Despite large variations in plasma levels of parent compound and its metabolites, the urinary recovery of Metabolite V is consistent and shows dose proportionality. Less than 4% of the administered dose is recovered in feces. Food intake shortly before dosing delays absorption of an immediate-release dosage form but does not affect total absorption. The pharmacokinetics and metabolism of pentoxifylline have not been studied in patients with renal and/or hepatic dysfunction. The pentoxifylline Â AUC was increased and elimination rate decreased in an older population (60 to 68 years, n=6) compared to younger individuals (22 to 30 years, n=6) (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_3ac89fef-6447-4de9-8240-93aba920fb80">PRECAUTIONS</a>, <a href="#LINK_05d7ab6d-f828-486e-a5ae-62d7a33646be">Geriatric Use</a></span>).</p>
<p>After administration of the 400 mg extended-release pentoxifylline tablet, plasma levels of the parent compound and its metabolites reach their maximum within 2 to 4 hours and remain constant over an extended period of time. Coadministration of pentoxifylline tablets with meals resulted in an increase in mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC by about 28% and 13% for pentoxifylline, respectively. C<span class="Sub">max</span> for Metabolite 1 also increased by about 20%. The extended release of pentoxifylline from the tablet eliminates peaks and troughs in plasma levels for improved gastrointestinal tolerance.</p>

<p>Patients with chronic occlusive arterial disease of the limbs frequently show other manifestations of arteriosclerotic disease. Pentoxifylline has been used safely for treatment of peripheral arterial disease in patients with concurrent coronary artery and cerebrovascular diseases, but there have been occasional reports of angina, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span>. Controlled trials do not show that pentoxifylline causes such adverse effects more often than placebo, but, as it is a methylxanthine derivative, it is possible some individuals will experience such responses.

<p>Concomitant administration of pentoxifylline and theophylline-containing drugs leads to increased theophylline levels and theophylline toxicity in some individuals. Such patients should be closely monitored for signs of toxicity and have their theophylline dosage adjusted as necessary. </p>
<p>Pentoxifylline has been used concurrently with beta blockers, digitalis, diuretics, antidiabetic agents, and antiarrhythmics, without observed problems. Small decreases in blood pressure have been observed in some patients treated with pentoxifylline plus nifedipine or captopril; periodic systemic blood pressure monitoring is recommended for patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive therapy. If indicated, dosage of the antihypertensive agents should be reduced.</p>
<p>Postmarketing cases of increased anticoagulant activity have been reported in patients concomitantly treated with pentoxifylline and vitamin K antagonists. Monitoring of anticoagulant activity in these patients is recommended when pentoxifylline is introduced or the dose is changed.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility</span></span></h2>
<p class="First">Long-term studies of the carcinogenic potential of pentoxifylline were conducted in mice and rats by dietary administration of the drug at doses up to 450 mg/kg (approximately 19 times the maximum recommended human daily dose (MRHD) in both species when based on body weight; 1.5 times the MRHD in the mouse and 3.3 times the MRHD in the rat when based on body surface area). In mice, the drug was administered for 18 months, whereas in rats, the drug was administered for 18 months followed by an additional 6 months without drug exposure. In the rat study, there was a statistically significant increase in benign mammary fibroadenomas in females of the 450 mg/kg group. The relevance of this finding to human use is uncertain. Pentoxifylline was devoid of mutagenic activity in various <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span> (Ames test) and in cultured mammalian cells (unscheduled DNA synthesis test) when tested in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. It was also negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. </p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers</span></h2>
<p class="First">Pentoxifylline and its metabolites are excreted in human milk.

<h2><span class="Bold">Geriatric Use</span></h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of pentoxifylline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>
<p>The active metabolite is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span></h1>
<p class="First">Clinical trials were conducted using either extended-release pentoxifylline tablets for up to 60 weeks or immediate-release pentoxifylline capsules for up to 24 weeks. Dosage ranges in the tablet studies were 400 mg bid to tid and in the capsule studies, 200 to 400 mg tid. The table summarizes the incidence (in percent) of adverse reactions considered drug related, as well as the numbers of patients who received extended-release pentoxifylline tablets, immediate-release pentoxifylline capsules, or the corresponding placebos. The incidence of adverse reactions was higher in the capsule studies (where dose related increases were seen in digestive and nervous system side effects) than in the tablet studies. Studies with the capsule include domestic experience, whereas studies with the extended-release tablets were conducted outside the U.S.</p>
<p>The table indicates that in the tablet studies few patients discontinued because of adverse effects.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span></h1>
<p class="First">Overdosage with pentoxifylline has been reported in pediatric patients and adults. Symptoms appear to be dose related. A report from a poison control center on 44 patients taking <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> of enteric-coated pentoxifylline tablets noted that symptoms usually occurred 4 to 5 hours after ingestion and lasted about 12 hours.

In addition to symptomatic treatment and gastric lavage, special attention must be given to supporting respiration, maintaining systemic blood pressure, and controlling <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>. Activated charcoal has been used to absorb pentoxifylline in patients who have overdosed.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span></h1>
<p class="First">The usual dosage of pentoxifylline in extended-release tablet form is one tablet (400 mg) three times a day with meals.</p>
<p>While the effect of pentoxifylline may be seen within 2 to 4 weeks, it is recommended that treatment be continued for at least 8 weeks. Efficacy has been demonstrated in double-blind clinical studies of 6 months duration.</p>
<p>Digestive and central nervous system side effects are dose related. If patients develop these effects it is recommended that the dosage be lowered to one tablet twice a day (800 mg/day). If side effects persist at this lower dosage, the administration of pentoxifylline should be discontinued.</p>
