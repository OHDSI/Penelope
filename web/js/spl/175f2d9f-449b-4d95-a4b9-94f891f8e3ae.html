<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<a href="#section-"></a><span class="Bold"><br>Mechanism of Action</span><p class="First">The precise mechanism by which tiagabine exerts its antiseizure 
effect is unknown, although it is believed to be related to its ability, 
documented in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> experiments, to enhance the 
activity of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory 
neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. These experiments have shown 
that tiagabine binds to recognition sites associated with the GABA uptake 
carrier. It is thought that, by this action, tiagabine blocks GABA uptake into 
presynaptic neurons, permitting more GABA to be available for receptor binding 
on the surfaces of post-synaptic cells. Inhibition of GABA uptake has been shown 
for synaptosomes, neuronal cell cultures, and glial cell cultures. In 
rat-derived hippocampal slices, tiagabine has been shown to prolong 
GABA-mediated inhibitory post-synaptic potentials. Tiagabine increases the 
amount of GABA available in the extracellular space of the globus pallidus, 
ventral palladum, and substantia nigra in rats at the ED<span class="Sub">50</span> and ED<span class="Sub">85</span> doses for inhibition of 
pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced tonic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>. This suggests that tiagabine 
prevents the propagation of neural impulses that contribute to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> by a 
GABA-ergic action.</p>
<p>Tiagabine has shown efficacy in several animal models of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>. It is 
effective against the tonic phase of subcutaneous PTZ-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> in mice 
and rats, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> induced by the proconvulsant DMCM in mice, audiogenic 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> in genetically <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>-prone rats (GEPR), and amygdala-kindled 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> in rats. Tiagabine has little efficacy against maximal electroshock 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> in rats and is only partially effective against subcutaneous 
PTZ-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4265182" conceptname="Clonic seizure">clonic seizures</span> in mice, picrotoxin-induced tonic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> in the 
mouse, bicuculline-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> in the rat, and photic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> in 
photosensitive baboons. Tiagabine produces a biphasic dose-response curve 
against PTZ- and DMCM-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>, with attenuated effectiveness at 
higher doses.</p>
<p>Based on <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> binding studies, tiagabine does 
not significantly inhibit the uptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, 
glutamate, or choline and shows little or no binding to dopamine D1 and D2, 
muscarinic, serotonin 5HT<span class="Sub">1A</span>, 5HT<span class="Sub">2</span>, 
and 5HT<span class="Sub">3</span>, beta-1 and 2 adrenergic, alpha-1 and alpha-2 
adrenergic, histamine H2 and H3, adenosine A<span class="Sub">1</span> and A<span class="Sub">2</span>, opiate µ and K<span class="Sub">1</span>, NMDA glutamate, and 
GABA<span class="Sub">A</span> receptors at 100 µM. It also lacks significant 
affinity for sodium or calcium channels. Tiagabine binds to histamine H1, 
serotonin 5HT<span class="Sub">1B</span>, benzodiazepine, and chloride channel 
receptors at concentrations 20 to 400 times those inhibiting the uptake of 
GABA.</p>
<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><span class="Bold"><br>Pharmacokinetics</span><p>Tiagabine is well absorbed, with food slowing absorption rate but 
not altering the extent of absorption. The elimination half-life of tiagabine is 
7 to 9 hours in normal volunteers. In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> clinical trials, most patients 
were receiving hepatic enzyme-inducing agents (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, 
primidone, and phenobarbital). The pharmacokinetic profile in induced patients 
is significantly different from the non-induced population (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#section-">    PRECAUTIONS, 
General, Use in Non-Induced Patients</a></span>). The systemic clearance of 
tiagabine in induced patients is approximately 60% greater resulting in 
considerably lower plasma concentrations and an elimination half-life of 2 to 5 
hours. Given this difference in clearance, the systemic exposure after a dose of 
32 mg/day in an induced population is expected to be comparable to the systemic 
exposure after a dose of 12 mg/day in a non-induced population. Similarly, the 
systemic exposure after a dose of 56 mg/day in an induced population is expected 
to be comparable to the systemic exposure after a dose of 22 mg/day in a 
non-induced population.  </p>
<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><span class="Bold"><br>Absorption and Distribution</span><p>Absorption of tiagabine is rapid, with peak plasma concentrations 
occurring at approximately 45 minutes following an oral dose in the fasting 
state. Tiagabine is nearly completely absorbed (&gt;95%), with an absolute oral 
bioavailability of about 90%. A high fat meal decreases the rate (mean T<span class="Sub">max</span> was prolonged to 2.5 hours, and mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> was reduced by about 40%) but not the extent (AUC) of 
tiagabine absorption. In all clinical trials, tiagabine was given with 
meals.</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of tiagabine are linear over the single dose range of 2 
to 24 mg. Following multiple dosing, steady state is achieved within 2 days.</p>
<p>Tiagabine is 96% bound to human plasma proteins, mainly to serum albumin and 
α1-acid glycoprotein over the concentration range of 10 ng/mL to 10,000 ng/mL. 
While the relationship between tiagabine plasma concentrations and clinical 
response is not currently understood, trough plasma concentrations observed in 
controlled clinical trials at doses from 30 to 56 mg/day ranged from less than 1 ng/mL 
to 234 ng/mL.</p>
<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><span class="Bold"><br>Metabolism and Elimination</span><p> Although the metabolism of tiagabine has not been fully 
elucidated, <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> and <span class="Italics">in 
vitro</span> studies suggest that at least two metabolic pathways for tiagabine 
have been identified in humans: 1) thiophene ring oxidation leading to the 
formation of 5-oxo-tiagabine; and 2) glucuronidation. The 5-oxo-tiagabine 
metabolite does not contribute to the pharmacologic activity of tiagabine.</p>
<p>Based on <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> data, tiagabine is likely to be 
metabolized primarily by the 3A isoform subfamily of hepatic cytochrome P450 
(CYP 3A), although contributions to the metabolism of tiagabine from CYP 1A2, 
CYP 2D6 or CYP 2C19 have not been excluded.</p>
<p>Approximately 2% of an oral dose of tiagabine is excreted unchanged, with 25% 
and 63% of the remaining dose excreted into the urine and feces, respectively, 
primarily as metabolites, at least 2 of which have not been identified. The mean 
systemic plasma clearance is 109 mL/min (CV = 23%) and the average elimination 
half-life for tiagabine in healthy subjects ranged from 7 to 9 hours. The 
elimination half-life decreased by 50 to 65% in hepatic enzyme-induced patients 
with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> compared to uninduced patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>.</p>
<p>A diurnal effect on the pharmacokinetics of tiagabine was observed. Mean 
steady-state C<span class="Sub">min</span>values were 40% lower in the evening 
than in the morning. Tiagabine steady-state AUC values were also found to be 15% 
lower following the evening tiagabine dose compared to the AUC following the 
morning dose.</p>

(creatinine clearance 20 to 39 mL/min), or severe (creatinine clearance 5 to 19

tiagabine and/or longer dosing intervals compared to patients with normal

</p>
<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><br>Geriatric<p>The pharmacokinetic profile of tiagabine was similar in healthy

<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><br>Pediatric<p> Tiagabine has not been investigated in adequate and 
well-controlled clinical trials in patients below the age of 12. The apparent 
clearance and volume of distribution of tiagabine per unit body surface area or 
per kg were fairly similar in 25 children (age: 3 to 10 years) and in adults 
taking enzyme-inducing antiepilepsy drugs ([AEDs] e.g., carbamazepine or 
phenytoin). In children who were taking a non-inducing AED (e.g., valproate), 
the clearance of tiagabine based upon body weight and body surface area was 2 
and 1.5-fold higher, respectively, than in non-induced adults with 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>.</p>
<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><br>Gender, Race and Cigarette Smoking<p> No specific pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to 
investigate the effect of gender, race and cigarette smoking on the disposition 
of tiagabine. Retrospective pharmacokinetic analyses, however, suggest that 
there is no clinically important difference between the clearance of tiagabine 
in males and females, when adjusted for body weight. Population pharmacokinetic 
analyses indicated that tiagabine clearance values were not significantly 
different in Caucasian (N=463), Black (N=23), or Hispanic (N=17) patients with 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>, and that tiagabine clearance values were not significantly affected by

<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><br>Interactions with other Antiepilepsy Drugs<p> The clearance of tiagabine is affected by the co-administration

carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone and phenobarbital than in patients not

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First">The effectiveness of GABITRIL as adjunctive therapy (added to 
other antiepilepsy drugs) was examined in three multi-center, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group, clinical trials in 769 patients with 
refractory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106574" conceptname="Partial seizure">partial seizures</span> who were taking at least one hepatic enzyme-inducing 
antiepilepsy drug (AED), and two placebo-controlled cross-over studies in 90 
patients. In the parallel-group trials, patients had a history of at least six 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4236312" conceptname="Complex partial epileptic seizure">complex partial seizures</span> (Study 1 and Study 2, U.S. studies), or six partial 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> of any type (Study 3, European study), occurring alone or in 
combination with any other <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> type within the 8-week period preceding the 
first study visit in spite of receiving one or more AEDs at therapeutic 
concentrations.</p>
<p>In the first two studies, the primary protocol-specified outcome measure was 
the median reduction from baseline in the 4-week complex partial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> (CPS) 
rates during treatment. In the third study, the protocol-specified primary 
outcome measure was the proportion of patients achieving a 50% or greater 
reduction from baseline in the 4-week <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> rate of all <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106574" conceptname="Partial seizure">partial seizures</span> 
during treatment. The results given below include data for complex partial 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> and all <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106574" conceptname="Partial seizure">partial seizures</span> for the intent-to-treat population (all 
patients who received at least one dose of treatment and at least one <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> 
evaluation) in each study.</p>
<p>Study 1 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial 
comparing GABITRIL 16 mg/day, GABITRIL 32 mg/day, GABITRIL 56 mg/day, and 
placebo. Study drug was given as a four times a day regimen. After a prospective 
Baseline Phase of 12 weeks, patients were randomized to one of the four 
treatment groups described above. The 16-week Treatment Phase consisted of a 
4-week Titration Period, followed by a 12-week Fixed-Dose Period, during which 
concomitant AED doses were held constant. The primary outcome was assessed for 
the combined 32 and 56 mg/day groups compared to placebo.</p>
<p>Study 2 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial 
consisting of an 8-week Baseline Phase and a 12-week Treatment Phase, the first 
4 weeks of which constituted a Titration Period and the last 8 weeks a 
Fixed-Dose Period. This study compared GABITRIL 16 mg BID and 8 mg QID to 
placebo. The protocol-specified primary outcome measure was assessed separately 
for each group treated with GABITRIL.</p>

<p class="First">Figures 1 to 4 present the proportion of patients (X-axis) whose percent 
reduction from baseline in the all partial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> rate was at least as great as 
that indicated on the Y axis in the three placebo-controlled adjunctive studies 
(Studies 1, 2, and 3). A positive value on the Y axis indicates an improvement 
from baseline (i.e., a decrease in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> rate), while a negative value 
indicates a worsening from baseline (i.e., an increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> rate). Thus, 
in a display of this type, the curve for an effective treatment is shifted to 
the left of the curve for placebo.</p>
<p>Figure 1 indicates that the proportion of patients achieving any particular 
level of reduction in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> rate was consistently higher for the combined 
GABITRIL 32 mg and 56 mg groups compared to the placebo group in Study 1. For

GABITRIL experienced a 50% or greater reduction, compared to 4% in the placebo 
group.</p>

<p>Figure 2 also displays the results for Study 1, which was a dose-response study, 
by treatment group, without combining GABITRIL dosage groups. Figure 2 indicates 
a dose-response relationship across the three GABITRIL groups. The proportion of 
patients achieving any particular level of reduction in all partial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> 
rates was consistently higher as the dose of GABITRIL was increased. For

group experienced a 50% or greater reduction in all partial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> rate,

<p>Figure 3 indicates that the proportion of patients achieving any particular

placebo to GABITRIL 32 mg/day; one of the GABITRIL groups received 8 mg QID,

<p>The two other placebo-controlled trials that examined the effectiveness of 
GABITRIL were small cross-over trials (N=46 and 44). Both trials included an 
open Screening Phase during which patients were titrated to an optimal dose and 
then treated with this dose for an additional 4 weeks. After this Open Phase, 
patients were randomized to one of two blinded treatment sequences (GABITRIL 
followed by placebo or placebo followed by GABITRIL). The Double-Blind Phase 
consisted of two Treatment Periods, each lasting 7 weeks (with a 3 week washout

risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any 
indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored 
for the emergence or worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, suicidal thoughts or behavior, 
and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</p>
<p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and 
adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one 
of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% 
CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to 
placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the 
estimated incidence rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322252" conceptname="Suicidal behavior">suicidal behavior</span> or ideation among 27,863 
AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated 
patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal 
thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> in 
drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but 
the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>.</p>
<p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as 
early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the 
duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did 
not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 
weeks could not be assessed.</p>
<p>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among 
drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying 
mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk 
applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially 
by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.</p>

AEDs.</p>

<p>Anyone considering prescribing GABITRIL or any other AED must balance the 
risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">Epilepsy</span> and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves 
associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal

symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.</p>
<p>Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs 
increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the 
need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of

rapid withdrawal.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Bold"></span><br><span class="Bold">Cognitive/Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events</span><p> Adverse events most often associated with the use of GABITRIL 
were related to the central nervous system. The most significant of these can be 
classified into 2 general categories: 1) impaired concentration, speech or 
language problems, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> (effects on thought processes); and 2) 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span> (effects on level of consciousness). The majority of 
these events were mild to moderate. In controlled clinical trials, these events 
led to discontinuation of treatment with GABITRIL in 6% (31 of 494) of patients 
compared to 2% (5 of 275) of the placebo-treated patients. A total of 1.6% (8 of 
494) of the GABITRIL treated patients in the controlled trials were hospitalized 
secondary to the occurrence of these events compared to 0% of the placebo 
treated patients. Some of these events were dose related and usually began 
during initial titration.</p>
<p>Patients with a history of spike and wave discharges on EEG have been 
reported to have exacerbations of their EEG abnormalities associated with these 
cognitive/neuropsychiatric events. This raises the possibility that these 
clinical events may, in some cases, be a manifestation of underlying <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> 
activity (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_lab_tests_ID__7045db7a-d91d-ed0a-85da-5dafb93865bc">PRECAUTIONS, 
Laboratory Tests, EEG</a></span>). In the documented cases of spike and wave 
discharges on EEG with cognitive/neuropsychiatric events, patients usually 
continued tiagabine, but required dosage adjustment.</p>
<p>Additionally, there have been postmarketing reports of patients who have 
experienced cognitive/neuropsychiatric symptoms, some accompanied by EEG 
abnormalities such as generalized spike and wave activity, that have been 
reported as nonconvulsant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span>. Some reports describe recovery 
following reduction of dose or discontinuation of GABITRIL.</p>

(simple, complex, or generalized tonic-clonic) in patients receiving GABITRIL 
was 0.8% (4 of 494 patients) versus 0.7% (2 of 275 patients) receiving placebo. 
Among the patients treated with GABITRIL across all <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> studies (controlled 
and uncontrolled), 5% had some form of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span>. Of the 5%, 57% of 
patients experienced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4043559" conceptname="Complex partial status epilepticus">complex partial status epilepticus</span>. A critical risk factor 
for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span> was the presence of a previous history; 33% of patients 
with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span> had recurrence during GABITRIL treatment.

rates in patients receiving GABITRIL are also similar to those observed in

<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><br>Binding in the Eye and Other Melanin-Containing 
Tissues<p>When dogs received a single dose of radiolabeled tiagabine, there 
was evidence of residual binding in the retina and uvea after 3 weeks (the 
latest time point measured). Although not directly measured, melanin binding is 
suggested. The ability of available tests to detect potentially adverse 
consequences, if any, of the binding of tiagabine to melanin-containing tissue 
is unknown and there was no systematic monitoring for relevant ophthalmological 
changes during the clinical development of GABITRIL. However, long term (up to 
one year) toxicological studies of tiagabine in dogs showed no treatment-related 
ophthalmoscopic changes and macro- and microscopic examinations of the eye were 
unremarkable. Accordingly, although there are no specific recommendations for 
periodic ophthalmologic monitoring, prescribers should be aware of the 
possibility of long-term ophthalmologic effects.</p>
<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><br>Use in Hepatically-Impaired Patients<p> Because the clearance of tiagabine is reduced in patients with

<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rashes</span>. In two patients, the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> was described as maculopapular; in one it was 
described as vesiculobullous; and in the 4th case, a diagnosis of Stevens 
Johnson Syndrome was made. In none of the 4 cases is it certain that tiagabine 
was the primary, or even a contributory, cause of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>. Nevertheless, drug 
associated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> can, if extensive and serious, cause irreversible morbidity,

<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><br>Information for Patients<p>Patients should be informed of the availability of a Medication 
Guide, and they should be instructed to read it prior to taking GABITRIL. The 
complete text of the Medication Guide is provided at the end of this 
labeling.</p>
<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><br>Suicidal Thinking and Behavior<p> Patients, their caregivers, and families should be counseled 
that AEDs, including GABITRIL, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and 
behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or 
worsening of symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or 
the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. 
Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised that GABITRIL may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, and 
other symptoms and signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span>. Accordingly, patients should be 
advised neither to drive nor to operate other complex machinery until they have 
gained sufficient experience on GABITRIL to gauge whether or not it affects 
their mental and/or motor performance adversely. Because of the possible 
additive depressive effects, caution should also be used when patients are 
taking other CNS depressants in combination with GABITRIL.</p>
<p>Because teratogenic effects were seen in the offspring of rats exposed to 
maternally toxic doses of tiagabine and because experience in humans is limited, 
patients should be advised to notify their physicians if they become pregnant or 
intend to become pregnant during therapy.</p>
<p>Because of the possibility that tiagabine may be excreted in breast milk, 
patients should be advised to notify those providing care to themselves and 
their children if they intend to breast-feed or are breast-feeding an 
infant.</p>
<p>Patients should be encouraged to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic 
Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is 
collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. 
To enroll, patients can call the toll free number 1-888-233-2334 (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#section-"> PRECAUTIONS</a></span>,<span class="Bold"><a href="#section-"> Pregnancy</a></span>).</p>
<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><span class="Bold"><br>Laboratory Tests</span><br><br>Therapeutic Monitoring of Plasma Concentrations of 
Tiagabine<p> A therapeutic range for tiagabine plasma concentrations has not 
been established. In controlled trials, trough plasma concentrations observed 
among patients randomized to doses of tiagabine that were statistically 
significantly more effective than placebo ranged from less than 1 ng/mL to 234 ng/mL 
(median, 10<span class="Sup">th</span> and 90<span class="Sup">th</span> percentiles 
are 23.7 ng/mL, 5.4 ng/mL, and 69.8 ng/mL, respectively). Because of the

<p>  </p>
<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a>Clinical Chemistry and Hematology<p> During the development of GABITRIL, no systematic abnormalities 
on routine laboratory testing were noted. Therefore, no specific guidance is 
offered regarding routine monitoring; the practitioner retains responsibility 
for determining how best to monitor the patient in his/her care.</p>
<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><br>EEG<p> Patients with a history of spike and wave discharges on EEG have 
been reported to have exacerbations of their EEG abnormalities associated with

activity (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#section-"> WARNINGS, 
Cognitive/Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events</a></span>). In the documented cases 
of spike and wave discharges on EEG with cognitive/neuropsychiatric events, 
patients usually continued tiagabine, but required dosage adjustment.</p>
<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><span class="Bold"><br>Drug Interactions</span><p>In evaluating the potential for interactions among 
co-administered antiepilepsy drugs (AEDs), whether or not an AED induces or does 
not induce metabolic enzymes is an important consideration. Carbamazepine, 
phenytoin, primidone, and phenobarbital are generally classified as enzyme 
inducers; valproate and gabapentin are not. GABITRIL is considered to be a 
non-enzyme inducing AED (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#section-"> PRECAUTIONS, 
General, Use in Non-Induced Patients</a></span>).</p>

no clinically important potentiation of the pharmacodynamic effects of triazolam

the nervous system, ethanol or triazolam should be used cautiously in 
combination with tiagabine.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Oral Contraceptives:</span> Multiple dose

<p>The effects of GABITRIL in relation to those of placebo on the incidence of

a statement regarding the distribution of adverse experience reports by 
race.</p>

Trials</span></span><p>GABITRIL has been administered to 2531 patients during all phase 
2/3 clinical trials, only some of which were placebo-controlled. During these 
trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using 
terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the 
proportion of individuals having adverse events, similar types of events were 
grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified COSTART 
dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. The 
frequencies presented represent the proportion of the 2531 patients exposed to 
GABITRIL who experienced events of the type cited on at least one occasion while 
receiving GABITRIL. All reported events are included except those already listed 
above, events seen only three times or fewer (unless potentially important), 
events very unlikely to be drug-related, and those too general to be 
informative. Events are included without regard to determination of a causal 
relationship to tiagabine.</p>
<p>Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in 
order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse 
events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent 
adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare events are 
those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<a href="#section-"></a>General:<p class="First">The blood level of tiagabine obtained after a given dose depends 
on whether the patient also is receiving a drug that induces the metabolism of 
tiagabine. The presence of an inducer means that the attained blood level will 
be substantially reduced. Dosing should take the presence of concomitant 
medications into account.</p>
<p>GABITRIL (tiagabine HCl) is recommended as adjunctive therapy for the 
treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106574" conceptname="Partial seizure">partial seizures</span> in patients 12 years and older.</p>
<p>The following dosing recommendations apply to all patients taking 
GABITRIL:</p>
<ul>
<li>GABITRIL is given orally and should be taken with food. 
</li>
<li>Do not use a loading dose of GABITRIL. 
</li>
<li>Dose titration: Rapid escalation and/or large dose increments of GABITRIL 
should not be used. 
</li>
<li>Missed dose(s): If the patient forgets to take the prescribed dose of 
GABITRIL at the scheduled time, the patient should not attempt to make up for 
the missed dose by increasing the next dose. If a patient has missed multiple 
doses, patient should refer back to his or her physician for possible 
re-titration as clinically indicated. 
</li>
<li>Dosage adjustment of GABITRIL should be considered whenever a change in 
patient’s enzyme-inducing status occurs as a result of the addition, 
discontinuation, or dose change of the enzyme-inducing agent. </li>
</ul>
<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a>Induced Adults and Adolescents 12 Years or 
Older:<p> The following dosing recommendations apply to patients who are 
already taking enzyme-inducing antiepilepsy drugs (AEDs) (e.g., carbamazepine, 
phenytoin, primidone, and phenobarbital). Such patients are considered induced 
patients when administering GABITRIL.</p>
<p>In adolescents 12 to 18 years old, GABITRIL should be initiated at 4 mg once 
daily. Modification of concomitant antiepilepsy drugs is not necessary, unless 
clinically indicated. The total daily dose of GABITRIL may be increased by 4 mg 
at the beginning of Week 2. Thereafter, the total daily dose may be increased by 
4 to 8 mg at weekly intervals until clinical response is achieved or up to 32 
mg/day. The total daily dose should be given in divided doses two to four times 
daily. Doses above 32 mg/day have been tolerated in a small number of adolescent 
patients for a relatively short duration.</p>
<p>In adults, GABITRIL should be initiated at 4 mg once daily. Modification of 
concomitant antiepilepsy drugs is not necessary, unless clinically indicated. 
The total daily dose of GABITRIL may be increased by 4 to 8 mg at weekly 
intervals until clinical response is achieved or, up to 56 mg/day. The total 
daily dose should be given in divided doses two to four times daily. Doses above 
56 mg/day have not been systematically evaluated in adequate and well-controlled 
clinical trials.</p>
<p>Experience is limited in patients taking total daily doses above 32 mg/day 
using twice daily dosing. A typical dosing titration regimen for patients taking 
enzyme-inducing AEDs (induced patients) is provided in Table 7.</p>

<h1>ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">In repeat dose toxicology studies, dogs receiving daily oral 
doses of 5 mg/kg/day or greater experienced unexpected CNS effects throughout 
the study. These effects occurred acutely and included marked sedation and 
apparent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373786" conceptname="Abnormal vision">visual impairment</span> which was characterized by a lack of awareness of 
objects, failure to fix on and follow moving objects, and absence of a blink 
reaction. Plasma exposures (AUCs) at 5 mg/kg/day were equal to those in humans 
receiving the maximum recommended daily human dose of 56 mg/day. The effects 
were reversible upon cessation of treatment and were not associated with any 
observed structural abnormality. The implications of these findings for humans 
are unknown.</p>
