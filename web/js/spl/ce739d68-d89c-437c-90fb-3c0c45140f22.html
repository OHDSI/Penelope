<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">The role of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> in atherogenesis is supported by pathological observations, clinical studies, and many animal experiments. Observational epidemiological studies have clearly established that high total or LDL <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> are risk factors for coronary heart disease. The Coronary Drug Project<span class="Sup">1</span>, completed in 1975, was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of nicotinic acid and other lipid-altering drugs in men 30 to 64 years old with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> (MI). Over an observation period of five years, nicotinic acid showed a statistically significant benefit in decreasing nonfatal, recurrent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarctions</span>. The incidence of definite, nonfatal MI was 8.9% for the 1,119 patients randomized to nicotinic acid versus 12.2% for the 2,789 patients who received placebo (p&lt; 0.004). Though total mortality was similar in the two groups at five years (24.4% with nicotinic acid versus 25.4% with placebo; p =N.S.), in a fifteenyear cumulative follow-up there were 11% (69) fewer <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> in the nicotinic acid group compared to the placebo cohort (52.0% versus 58.2%; p=0.0004)<span class="Sup">2</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">Cholesterol</span>-Lowering <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103842" conceptname="Arteriosclerosis">Atherosclerosis</span> Study (CLAS) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, angiographic trial testing combined colestipol and nicotinic acid therapy in 162 non-smoking males with previous coronary bypass surgery<span class="Sup">3</span>. The primary, per subject cardiac endpoint was global coronary artery change score. After two years, 61% of patients in the placebo cohort showed disease progression by global change score (N=82), compared with only 38.8% of drug-treated subjects (N=80), when both native arteries and grafts were considered (p&lt;0.005). In a follow-up to this trial in a subgroup of 103 patients treated for four years, again, significantly fewer patients in the drug-treated group demonstrated progression than in the placebo cohort (48% versus 85%, respectively; p&lt; 0.0001)<span class="Sup">4</span>.</p>
<p>The Familial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103842" conceptname="Arteriosclerosis">Atherosclerosis</span> Treatment Study (FATS) in 146 men ages 62 and younger with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4122128" conceptname="Apolipoprotein">apolipoprotein</span> B levels â‰¥125 mg/dL, established <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317576" conceptname="Coronary arteriosclerosis">coronary artery disease</span>, and family histories of vascular disease, assessed change in severity of disease in the proximal coronary arteries by quantitative arteriography<span class="Sup">5</span>. Patients were given dietary counseling and randomized to treatment with either conventional therapy with double placebo (or placebo plus colestipol if the LDL <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> was elevated); lovastatin plus colestipol; or nicotinic acid plus colestipol. In the conventional therapy group, 46% of patients had disease progression (and no regression) in at least one of nine proximal coronary segments. In contrast, progression (as the only change) was seen in only 25% in the nicotinic acid plus colestipol group. Though not an original endpoint of the trial, clinical events (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, or revascularization for worsening angina) occurred in 10 of 52 patients who received conventional therapy, compared with 2 of 48 who received nicotinic acid plus colestipol.</p>
<p>Nicotinic acid (but not nicotinamide) in gram doses produces an average 10-20% reduction in total and LDL <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>, a 30-70% reduction in triglycerides, and an average 20-35% increase in HDL <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>. The magnitude of individual lipid and lipoprotein responses may be influenced by the severity and type of underlying lipid abnormality. The increase in total HDL is associated with a shift in the distribution of HDL subfractions (as defined by ultra-centrifugation) with an increase in the HDL<span class="Sub">2</span>:HDL<span class="Sub">3</span> ratio and an increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4122128" conceptname="Apolipoprotein">apolipoprotein</span> A-I content. The mechanism by which nicotinic acid exerts these effects is not entirely understood, but may involve several actions, including a decrease in esterification of hepatic triglycerides. Nicotinic acid treatment also decreases the serum levels of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4122128" conceptname="Apolipoprotein">apolipoprotein</span> B-100 (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4098284" conceptname="Apolipoprotein B">apo B</span>), the major protein component of the very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL fractions, and of lipoprotein a [Lp(a)], a variant form of LDL independently associated with coronary risk. The effect of nicotinic acid-induced changes in lipids/lipoproteins on cardiovascular morbidity or mortality in individuals without pre-existing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317576" conceptname="Coronary arteriosclerosis">coronary disease</span> has not been established.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Following an oral dose, the pharmacokinetic profile of nicotinic acid is characterized by rapid absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and a short plasma elimination half-life. At a 1 gram dose, peak plasma concentrations of 15 to 30 Î¼g/mL are reached within 30 to 60 minutes. Approximately 88% of an oral pharmacologic dose is eliminated by the kidneys as unchanged drug and nicotinuric acid, its primary metabolite. The plasma elimination half-life of nicotinic acid ranges from 20 to 45 minutes.</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">I. Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in those individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437827" conceptname="Pure hypercholesterolemia">hypercholesterolemia</span>. Nicotinic acid, alone or in combination with a bile-acid binding resin, is indicated as an adjunct to diet for the reduction of elevated total and LDL <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> levels in patients with primary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437827" conceptname="Pure hypercholesterolemia">hypercholesterolemia</span> (Types IIa and IIb)<span class="Sup">â€ </span>, when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate (see also the NCEP treatment guidelines<span class="Sup">6</span>). Prior to initiating therapy with nicotinic acid, secondary causes for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437827" conceptname="Pure hypercholesterolemia">hypercholesterolemia</span> (e.g., poorly controlled <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140673" conceptname="Hypothyroidism">hypothyroidism</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="195314" conceptname="Nephrotic syndrome">nephrotic syndrome</span>, dysproteinemias, obstructive liver disease, other drug therapy, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218106" conceptname="Alcoholism">alcoholism</span>) should be excluded, and a lipid profile performed to measure total <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>, HDL <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>, and triglycerides.</p>
<p>II. Nicotinic acid is also indicated as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of adult patients with very high serum triglyceride levels (Types IV and V <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432867" conceptname="Hyperlipidemia">hyperlipidemia</span>)<span class="Sup">â€ </span> who present a risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192640" conceptname="Pancreatitis">pancreatitis</span> and who do not respond adequately to a determined dietary effort to control them. Such patients typically have serum triglyceride levels over 2000 mg/dL and have elevations of VLDL <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> as well as fasting chylomicrons (Type V <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432867" conceptname="Hyperlipidemia">hyperlipidemia</span>)<span class="Sup">â€ </span>. Subjects who consistently have total serum or plasma triglycerides below 1000 mg/dL are unlikely to develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192640" conceptname="Pancreatitis">pancreatitis</span>. Therapy with nicotinic acid may be considered for those subjects with triglyceride elevations between 1000 and 2000 mg/dL who have a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192640" conceptname="Pancreatitis">pancreatitis</span> or of recurrent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal pain</span> typical of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192640" conceptname="Pancreatitis">pancreatitis</span>. Some Type IV patients with triglycerides under 1000 mg/dL may, through dietary or alcoholic indiscretion, convert to a Type V pattern with massive triglyceride elevations accompanying fasting chylomicronemia, but the influence of nicotinic acid therapy on the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192640" conceptname="Pancreatitis">pancreatitis</span> in such situations has not been adequately studied. Drug therapy is not indicated for patients with Type I <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432867" conceptname="Hyperlipidemia">hyperlipoproteinemia</span>, who have elevations of chylomicrons and plasma triglycerides, but who have normal levels of VLDL.

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cases of severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4337543" conceptname="Hepatic necrosis">hepatic necrosis</span> have occurred in patients who have substituted sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) nicotinic acid products for immediate-release (crystalline) nicotinic acid at equivalent doses.</span></p>
<p>Liver function tests should be performed on all patients during therapy with nicotinic acid. Serum transaminase levels, including ALT (SGPT), should be monitored before treatment begins, every six weeks to twelve weeks for the first year, and periodically thereafter (e.g., at approximately 6 month intervals). Special attention should be paid to patients who develop elevated serum transaminase levels, and in these patients, measurements should be repeated promptly and then performed more frequently. If the transaminase levels show evidence of progression, particularly if they rise to three times the upper limit of normal and are persistent, the drug should be discontinued. Liver biopsy should be considered if elevations persist beyond discontinuation of the drug.</p>
<p>Nicotinic acid should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver diseases or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of nicotinic acid.</p>

Frequent monitoring of liver function tests and blood glucose should be performed to ascertain that the drug is producing no adverse effects on these organ systems. Diabetic patients may experience a dose-related rise in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44808385" conceptname="Pre-diabetes">glucose intolerance</span>, the clinical significance of which is unclear. Diabetic or potentially diabetic patients should be observed closely. Adjustment of diet and/or hypoglycemic therapy may be necessary.</p>
<p>Caution should also be used when nicotinic acid is used in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315296" conceptname="Preinfarction syndrome">unstable angina</span> or in the acute phase of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, particularly when such patients are also receiving vasoactive drugs such as nitrates, calcium channel blockers, or adrenergic blocking agents.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">The usual adult dosage of nicotinic acid is 1 to 2 grams two or three times a day. Doses should be individualized according to the patient's response. Start with one-half tablet (250 mg) as a single daily dose following the evening meal. The frequency of dosing and total daily dose can be increased every four to seven days until the desired LDL <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> and/or triglyceride level is achieved or the first-level therapeutic dose of 1.5 to 2 grams/day is reached. If the patient's <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432867" conceptname="Hyperlipidemia">hyperlipidemia</span> is not adequately controlled after 2 months at this level, the dosage can then be increased at two to four week intervals to 3 grams/day (1 gram three times per day). In patients with marked lipid abnormalities, a higher dose is occasionally required, but generally should not exceed 6 grams/day.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318566" conceptname="Flushing">Flushing</span> of the skin appears frequently and can be minimized by pretreatment with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Tolerance to this <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318566" conceptname="Flushing">flushing</span> develops rapidly over the course of several weeks. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318566" conceptname="Flushing">Flushing</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span>, and gastrointestinal distress are also greatly reduced by slowly increasing the dose of nicotinic acid and avoiding administration on an empty stomach.</p>
<p>Sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) nicotinic acid preparations should <span class="Bold">not</span> be substituted for equivalent doses of immediate-release (crystalline) nicotinic acid.</p>
