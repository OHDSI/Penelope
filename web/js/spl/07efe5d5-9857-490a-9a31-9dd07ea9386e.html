<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride is a central nervous system stimulant. Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride, the more pharmacologically active enantiomer of the <span class="Italics">d-</span> and <span class="Italics">l-</span>enantiomers, is thought to block the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space. The mode of therapeutic action in Attention Deficit <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">Hyperactivity</span> Disorder (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228617" conceptname="Add">ADHD</span>) is not known.</p>

<h2>Effects on QT Interval</h2>
<p class="First">The effect of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules on the QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo- and open label active (moxifloxacin)-controlled study following single doses of 40mg dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules in 75 healthy volunteers. ECGs were collected up to 12 hours postdose. Fredericaâ€™s method for heart rate correction was employed to derive the corrected QT interval (QTcF). The maximum mean prolongation of QTcF intervals was &lt;5 ms, and the upper limit of the 90% confidence interval was below 10 ms for all time matched comparisons versus placebo. This was below the threshold of clinical concern and there was no evident-exposure response relationship.</p>

<h3><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></h3>
<p class="First">Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride is readily absorbed following oral administration of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228617" conceptname="Add">ADHD</span>, plasma dexmethylphenidate concentrations increase rapidly, reaching a maximum in the fasted state at about 1 to 1.5 hours postdose. No differences in the pharmacokinetics of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets were noted following single and repeated twice daily dosing, thus indicating no significant drug accumulation in children with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228617" conceptname="Add">ADHD</span>.</p>
<p>When given to children as capsules in single doses of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg, C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0-inf</span> of dexmethylphenidate were proportional to dose. In the same study, plasma dexmethylphenidate levels were comparable to those achieved following single <span class="Italics">dl-</span><span class="Italics">threo</span><span class="Italics">-</span>methylphenidate HCl doses given as capsules in twice the total mg amount (equimolar with respect to dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets).</p>

<h3><span class="Italics">Food Effects</span></h3>
<p class="First">In a single dose study conducted in adults, coadministration of 2 x 10 mg dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets with a high fat breakfast resulted in a dexmethylphenidate t<span class="Sub">max</span> of 2.9 hours postdose as compared to 1.5 hours postdose when given in a fasting state. C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0-inf </span>were comparable in both the fasted and nonfasted states.</p>

<h3><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></h3>
<p class="First">Plasma dexmethylphenidate concentrations in children decline exponentially following oral administration of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets.</p>
</div>

<h3><span class="Italics">Metabolism and Excretion</span></h3>
<p class="First">In humans, dexmethylphenidate is metabolized primarily to <span class="Italics">d</span>-Î±-phenyl-piperidine acetic acid (also known as <span class="Italics">d-</span>ritalinic acid) by de-esterification. This metabolite has little or no pharmacological activity. There is little or no <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> interconversion to the <span class="Italics">l-</span><span class="Italics">threo</span><span class="Italics">-</span>enantiomer, based on a finding of minute levels of <span class="Italics">l-</span><span class="Italics">threo</span><span class="Italics">-</span>methylphenidate being detectable in a few samples in only 2 of 58 children and adults. After oral dosing of radiolabeled racemic methylphenidate in humans, about 90% of the radioactivity was recovered in urine. The main urinary metabolite was ritalinic acid, accountable for approximately 80% of the dose.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies showed that dexmethylphenidate did not inhibit cytochrome P450 isoenzymes.</p>
<p>The mean plasma elimination half-life of dexmethylphenidate is approximately 2.2 hours.</p>

<h3><span class="Italics">Gender</span></h3>
<p class="First">Pharmacokinetic parameters were similar for boys and girls (mean age 10 years).</p>
<p>In a single dose study conducted in adults, the mean dexmethylphenidate AUC<span class="Sub">0-inf</span> values (adjusted for body weight) following single 2 x 10 mg doses of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets were     25%-35% higher in adult female volunteers (n=6) compared to male volunteers (n=9). Both t<span class="Sub">max</span> and t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> were comparable for males and females.</p>

<h3><span class="Italics">Race</span></h3>
<p class="First">There is insufficient experience with the use of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets to detect ethnic variations in pharmacokinetics.</p>

<h3><span class="Italics">Age</span></h3>
<p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of dexmethylphenidate after dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride administration have not been studied in children less than 6 years of age. When single doses of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets were given to children between the ages of 6 to 12 years and healthy adult volunteers, C<span class="Sub">max</span> of dexmethylphenidate was similar, however, children showed somewhat lower AUCs compared to the adults.</p>

<h3><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">There is no experience with the use of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>. After oral administration of radiolabeled racemic methylphenidate in humans, methylphenidate was extensively metabolized and approximately 80% of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine in the form of ritalinic acid. Since very little unchanged drug is excreted in the urine, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> is expected to have little effect on the pharmacokinetics of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride.</p>

<h2>Clinical Studies</h2>
<p class="First">Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride  tablets were evaluated in 2 double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trials in untreated or previously treated patients aged 6 to 17 years old with a DSM-IV diagnosis of Attention Deficit <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">Hyperactivity</span> Disorder (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228617" conceptname="Add">ADHD</span>). Both studies included all 3 subtypes of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228617" conceptname="Add">ADHD</span>, <span class="Italics">i.e.</span>, Combined Type, Predominantly Inattentive Type, or Predominantly <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">Hyperactive</span>-Impulsive Type. While both children and adolescents were included, the sample was predominantly children, thus, the findings are most pertinent to this age group. In both studies, the primary comparison of interest was dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets <span class="Italics">versus</span> placebo.</p>
<p>Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets (5, 10, or 20 mg/day total dose), <span class="Italics">dl-</span><span class="Italics">threo</span><span class="Italics">-</span>methylphenidate HCl (10, 20, or 40 mg/day total dose), and placebo were compared in a multicenter, 4-week, parallel group study in n=132 patients. Patients took the study medication twice daily, 3.5 to 5.5 hours between doses. Treatment was initiated with the lowest dose, and doses could be doubled at weekly intervals, depending on clinical response and tolerability, up to the maximum dose. The change from baseline to week 4 of the averaged score (an average of 2 ratings during the week) of the teacherâ€™s version of the SNAP-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228617" conceptname="Add">ADHD</span> Rating Scale, a scale for assessing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228617" conceptname="Add">ADHD</span> symptoms, was the primary outcome. Patients treated with dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets showed a statistically significant improvement in symptom scores from baseline over patients who received placebo.</p>

<p>The other study, involving n=75 patients, was a multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 2-week treatment withdrawal study in children who were responders during a 6-week, open label initial treatment period. Children took study medication twice a day separated by a 3.5 to 5.5 hour interval. The primary outcome was proportion of treatment failures at the end of the 2-week withdrawal phase, where treatment failure was defined as a rating of 6 (much worse) or 7 (very much worse) on the Investigator Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I). Patients continued on dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets showed a statistically significant lower rate of failure over patients who received placebo.</p>

<h1>INDICATION AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets are indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">Hyperactivity</span> Disorder (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228617" conceptname="Add">ADHD</span>).</p>
<p>The efficacy of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228617" conceptname="Add">ADHD</span> was established in 2 controlled trials of patients aged 6 to 17 years of age who met DSM-IV criteria for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228617" conceptname="Add">ADHD</span> (see Clinical Studies).</p>
<p>A diagnosis of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228617" conceptname="Add">ADHD</span> (DSM-IV) implies the presence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">hyperactive</span>-impulsive or inattentive symptoms that cause impairment and were present before age 7 years. The symptoms must cause clinically significant impairment, <span class="Italics">e.g</span>., in social, academic, or occupational functioning; and be present in 2 or more settings, <span class="Italics">e.g</span>., school (or work) and at home. The symptoms must not be better accounted for by another <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432586" conceptname="Mental disorder">mental disorder</span>. For the inattentive type, at least 6 of the following symptoms must have persisted for at least 6 months: lack of attention to details/careless mistakes; lack of sustained attention; poor listener; failure to follow through on tasks; poor organization; avoids tasks requiring sustained mental effort; loses things; easily distracted; forgetful. For the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">Hyperactive</span>-Impulsive Type, at least 6 of the following symptoms must have persisted for at least 6 months: fidgeting/squirming; leaving seat; inappropriate running/climbing; difficulty with quiet activities; â€œon the go,â€? excessive talking; blurting answers; canâ€™t wait turn; intrusive. The Combined Type requires both inattentive and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">hyperactive</span>-impulsive criteria to be met.</p>

<h2>Special Diagnostic Considerations</h2>
<p class="First">Specific etiology of this syndrome is unknown, and there is no single diagnostic test. Adequate diagnosis requires the use not only of medical but of special psychological, educational, and social resources. Learning may or may not be impaired. The diagnosis must be based upon a complete history and evaluation of the child and not solely on the presence of the required number of DSM-IV characteristics.</p>

<h2>Need for Comprehensive Treatment Program</h2>
<p class="First">Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets are indicated as an integral part of a total treatment program for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228617" conceptname="Add">ADHD</span> that may include other measures (psychological, educational, social) for patients with this syndrome. Drug treatment may not be indicated for all patients with this syndrome. Stimulants are not intended for use in the patient who exhibits symptoms secondary to environmental factors and/or other primary psychiatric disorders, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychosis</span>. Appropriate educational placement is essential and psychosocial intervention is often helpful. When remedial measures alone are insufficient, the decision to prescribe stimulant medication will depend upon the physicianâ€™s assessment of the chronicity and severity of the patientâ€™s symptoms.</p>

<h2>Long-term Use</h2>
<p class="First">The effectiveness of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets for long-term use, <span class="Italics">i.e.</span>, for more than 6 weeks, has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials. Therefore, the physician who elects to use dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see <a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_8dd6e189-865d-4a8c-877f-684233cd3807">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>

<h2>Long-Term Suppression of Growth</h2>
<p class="First">Careful follow-up of weight and height in children ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or nonmedication treatment groups over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate-treated and nonmedication treated children over 36 months (to the ages of 10 to 13 years), suggests that consistently medicated children (i.e., treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have a temporary slowing in growth rate (on average, a total of about 2 cm less growth in height and 2.7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years), without evidence of growth rebound during this period of development. Published data are inadequate to determine whether chronic use of amphetamines may cause a similar suppression of growth, however, it is anticipated that they likely have this effect as well. Therefore, growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants, and patients who are not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted.</p>

Because of possible effects on blood pressure, dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride should be used cautiously with pressor agents. </p>
<p>Human pharmacologic studies have shown that racemic methylphenidate may inhibit the metabolism of coumarin anticoagulants, anticonvulsants (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone), and some antidepressants (tricyclics and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). Downward dose adjustments of these drugs may be required when given concomitantly with methylphenidate. It may be necessary to adjust the dosage and monitor plasma drug concentration (or, in the case of coumarin, coagulation times), when initiating or discontinuing concomitant methylphenidate.</p>

<h2>Pregnancy</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category C</span></p>
<p>In studies conducted in rats and rabbits, dexmethylphenidate was administered orally at doses of up to 20 and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, during the period of organogenesis. No evidence of teratogenic activity was found in either the rat or rabbit study; however, delayed fetal skeletal ossification was observed at the highest dose level in rats. When dexmethylphenidate was administered to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation at doses of up to 20 mg/kg/day, postweaning body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span> was decreased in male offspring at the highest dose, but no other effects on postnatal development were observed. At the highest doses tested, plasma levels (AUCs) of dexmethylphenidate in pregnant rats and rabbits were approximately 5 and 1 times, respectively, those in adults dosed with the maximum recommended human dose of 20 mg/day.</p>
<p>Racemic methylphenidate has been shown to have teratogenic effects in rabbits when given in doses of 200 mg/kg/day throughout organogenesis.</p>
<p>Adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women have not been conducted. Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">The safety and efficacy of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets in children under 6 years old have not been established. Long-term effects of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride in children have not been well established (see <a href="#i4i_warnings_id_7027f7a3-fa25-4b88-8932-a9b3fbcbbfff">WARNINGS</a>).</p>
<p>In a study conducted in young rats, racemic methylphenidate was administered orally at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day for 9 weeks, starting early in the postnatal period (Postnatal Day 7) and continuing through sexual maturity (Postnatal Week 10). When these animals were tested as adults (Postnatal Weeks 13â€‘14), decreased spontaneous locomotor activity was observed in males and females previously treated with 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 6 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of racemic methylphenidate on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) or greater, and a deficit in the acquisition of a specific learning task was seen in females exposed to the highest dose (12 times the racemic MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis). The no effect level for juvenile neurobehavioral development in rats was 5 mg/kg/day (half the racemic MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). The clinical significance of the long-term behavioral effects observed in rats is unknown.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">The premarketing development program for dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets included exposures in a total of 696 participants in clinical trials (684 patients, 12 healthy adult subjects). These participants received dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets 5, 10, or 20 mg/day. The 684 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228617" conceptname="Add">ADHD</span> patients (ages 6 to 17 years) were evaluated in 2 controlled clinical studies, 2 clinical pharmacology studies, and 2 uncontrolled long-term safety studies. Safety data on all patients are included in the discussion that follows. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse events, and results of physical examinations, vital sign and body weight measurements, and laboratory analyses.</p>
<p>Adverse events during exposure were primarily obtained by general inquiry and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tables and tabulations that follow, standard COSTART dictionary terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events.</p>
<p>The stated frequencies of adverse events represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse event of the type listed. An event was considered treatment emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation.</p>

<h2>Adverse Events Occurring at an Incidence of 5% or More Among Dexmethylphenidate Hydrochloride-Treated Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Table 1 enumerates treatment-emergent adverse events for 2, placebo-controlled, parallel group trials in children with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228617" conceptname="Add">ADHD</span> at dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg/day. The table includes only those events that occurred in 5% or more of patients treated with dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets where the incidence in patients treated with dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets was at least twice the incidence in placebo-treated patients. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those which prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to the adverse event incidence rate in the population studied.</p>

<h2>Poison Control Center</h2>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>

<h2>Patients New to Methylphenidate</h2>
<p class="First">The recommended starting dose of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets for patients who are not currently taking racemic methylphenidate, or for patients who are on stimulants other than methylphenidate, is 5 mg/day (2.5 mg twice daily).</p>

<h2>Patients Currently Using Methylphenidate</h2>

<h2>Maintenance/Extended Treatment</h2>
<p class="First">There is no body of evidence available from controlled trials to indicate how long the patient with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228617" conceptname="Add">ADHD</span> should be treated with dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets. It is generally agreed, however, that pharmacological treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228617" conceptname="Add">ADHD</span> may be needed for extended periods. Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets for extended periods in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228617" conceptname="Add">ADHD</span> should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient with periods off medication to assess the patientâ€™s functioning without pharmacotherapy. Improvement may be sustained when the drug is either temporarily or permanently discontinued.</p>

<h2>Dose Reduction and Discontinuation</h2>
<p class="First">If paradoxical aggravation of symptoms or other adverse events occur, the dosage should be reduced, or, if necessary, the drug should be discontinued.</p>
<p>If improvement is not observed after appropriate dosage adjustment over a 1-month period, the drug should be discontinued.</p>
