<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">CLEOCIN PHOSPHATE Sterile Solution in vials contains clindamycin phosphate, a water soluble ester of clindamycin and phosphoric acid. Each mL contains the equivalent of 150 mg clindamycin, 0.5 mg disodium edetate and 9.45 mg benzyl alcohol added as a preservative in each mL. Clindamycin is a semisynthetic antibiotic produced by a 7(S)-chloro-substitution of the 7(R)-hydroxyl group of the parent compound lincomycin.</p>
<p>The chemical name of clindamycin phosphate is L-<span class="Italics">threo</span>-a-D-<span class="Italics">galacto</span>-Octopyranoside, methyl-7-chloro-6,7,8-trideoxy-6-[[(1-methyl-4-propyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)carbonyl] amino]-1-thio-, 2-(dihydrogen phosphate), (<span class="Italics">2S-trans</span>)-.</p>
<p>The molecular formula is C18H34CIN2O8PS and the molecular weight is 504.96.</p>
<p>The structural formula is represented below:</p>

<p><span class="Bold">CLEOCIN PHOSPHATE in the ADD-Vantage Vial is intended for intravenous use only after further dilution with appropriate volume of ADD-Vantage diluent base solution.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"></span>CLEOCIN PHOSPHATE IV Solution in the Galaxy® plastic container for intravenous use is composed of clindamycin phosphate equivalent to 300, 600 and 900 mg of clindamycin premixed with 5% dextrose as a sterile solution. Disodium edetate has been added at a concentration of 0.04 mg/mL. The pH has been adjusted with sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid.</p>
<p>The plastic container is fabricated from a specially designed multilayer plastic, PL 2501. Solutions in contact with the plastic container can leach out certain of its chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period. The suitability of the plastic has been confirmed in tests in animals according to the USP biological tests for plastic containers, as well as by tissue culture toxicity studies.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p>
<p>Biologically inactive clindamycin phosphate is converted to active clindamycin.</p>
<p>By the end of short-term intravenous infusion, peak serum levels of active clindamycin are reached.</p>
<p>After intramuscular injection of clindamycin phosphate, peak levels of active clindamycin are reached within 3 hours in adults and 1 hour in pediatric patients. Serum level curves may be constructed from IV peak serum levels as given in Table 1 by application of elimination half-lives (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Excretion</span></span>).</p>
<p>Serum levels of clindamycin can be maintained above the <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">in vitro </span></span><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4190299" conceptname="Broth microdilution susceptibility test">minimum inhibitory concentrations</span> for most indicated organisms by administration of clindamycin phosphate every 8 to 12 hours in adults and every 6 to 8 hours in pediatric patients, or by continuous intravenous infusion. An equilibrium state is reached by the third dose.</p>
<p>No significant levels of clindamycin are attained in the cerebrospinal fluid even in the presence of inflamed meninges.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Excretion</span></p>
<p>Biologically inactive clindamycin phosphate disappears rapidly from the serum; the average elimination half-life is 6 minutes; however, the serum elimination half-life of active clindamycin is about 3 hours in adults and 2½ hours in pediatric patients.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Special Populations</span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Renal/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic Impairment</span></span></p>
<p>The elimination half-life of clindamycin is increased slightly in patients with markedly reduced renal or hepatic function. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not effective in removing clindamycin from the serum. Dosage schedules need not be modified in the presence of mild or moderate renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Use in Elderly</span></p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic studies in elderly volunteers (61–79 years) and younger adults (18–39 years) indicate that age alone does not alter clindamycin pharmacokinetics (clearance, elimination half-life, volume of distribution, and area under the serum concentration-time curve) after IV administration of clindamycin phosphate. After oral administration of clindamycin hydrochloride, elimination half-life is increased to approximately 4.0 hours (range 3.4–5.1 h) in the elderly, compared to 3.2 hours (range 2.1– 4.2 h) in younger adults. The extent of absorption, however, is not different between age groups and no dosage alteration is necessary for the elderly with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function1.</p>
<p>Serum assays for active clindamycin require an inhibitor to prevent <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">in vitro </span></span>hydrolysis of clindamycin phosphate.</p>

<p>Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S subunit of the ribosome. It has activity against Gram-positive aerobes and anaerobes, as well as some Gram-negative anaerobes. Clindamycin is bacteriostatic. Cross-resistance between clindamycin and lincomycin is complete. Antagonism <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">in vitro </span></span>has been demonstrated between clindamycin and erythromycin. Clindamycin inducible resistance has been identified in macrolide-resistant staphylococci and beta-hemolytic streptococci.

These reports should aid the physician in selecting the most effective antimicrobial.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Dilution Techniques</span></p>
<p>Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4190299" conceptname="Broth microdilution susceptibility test">minimum inhibitory concentrations</span> (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure based on dilution methods (broth, agar or microdilution) 2,3 or equivalent using standardized inoculum and concentrations of clindamycin. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the criteria provided in Table 2.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Diffusion Techniques</span></p>
<p>Quantitative methods that require the measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The standardized procedure 2,4 requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 2 mcg of clindamycin to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to clindamycin. Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with a 2 mcg clindamycin disk should be interpreted according to the criteria in Table 2.</p>

<p>A report of "Susceptible" indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable. A report of "Intermediate" indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone that prevents small, uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation.</p>
<p>A report of "Resistant" indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable; other therapy should be selected.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Quality Control</span></p>
<p>Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory controls to monitor and ensure the accuracy and precision of the supplies and reagents used in the assay, and the techniques of the individuals performing the test. 2,3,4,5 Standard clindamycin powder should provide the MIC ranges in Table 3.

<p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">C. difficile </span></span>may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span></span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p>
<p>A careful inquiry should be made concerning previous sensitivities to drugs and other allergens.</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">General</span></p>
<p>Review of experience to date suggests that a subgroup of older patients with associated severe illness may tolerate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span> less well. When clindamycin is indicated in these patients, they should be carefully monitored for change in bowel frequency.</p>
<p>CLEOCIN PHOSPHATE products should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4272488" conceptname="Colitis">colitis</span>.</p>
<p>CLEOCIN PHOSPHATE should be prescribed with caution in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4019380" conceptname="Atopy">atopic</span> individuals.</p>
<p>Certain <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> may require incision and drainage or other indicated surgical procedures in addition to antibiotic therapy.</p>
<p>The use of CLEOCIN PHOSPHATE may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms—particularly yeasts. Should <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4105019" conceptname="Superimposed infection">superinfections</span> occur, appropriate measures should be taken as indicated by the clinical situation.</p>
<p>CLEOCIN PHOSPHATE should not be injected intravenously undiluted as a bolus, but should be infused over at least 10–60 minutes as directed in the <span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION </span></span>section.</p>
<p>Clindamycin dosage modification may not be necessary in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>. In patients with moderate to severe liver disease, prolongation of clindamycin half-life has been found. However, it was postulated from studies that when given every eight hours, accumulation should rarely occur. Therefore, dosage modification in patients with liver disease may not be necessary. However, periodic liver enzyme determinations should be made when treating patients with severe liver disease.</p>
<p>Prescribing CLEOCIN PHOSPHATE in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432545" conceptname="Bacterial infectious disease">bacterial infection</span> or a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118659" conceptname="Prophylactic">prophylactic</span> indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Information for Patients</span></p>
<p>Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including CLEOCIN PHOSPHATE should only be used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432545" conceptname="Bacterial infectious disease">bacterial infections</span>. They do not treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440029" conceptname="Viral disease">viral infections</span> (e.g., the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">common cold</span>). When CLEOCIN PHOSPHATE is prescribed to treat a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432545" conceptname="Bacterial infectious disease">bacterial infection</span>, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by CLEOCIN PHOSPHATE or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">Diarrhea</span> is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443530" conceptname="Hematochezia">bloody stools</span> (with or without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194175" conceptname="Left upper quadrant pain">stomach cramps</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Laboratory Tests</span></p>
<p>During prolonged therapy periodic liver and kidney function tests and blood counts should be performed.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></p>
<p>Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents. Therefore, it should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents.</p>
<p>Antagonism has been demonstrated between clindamycin and erythromycin <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">in vitro</span></span>. Because of possible clinical significance, the two drugs should not be administered concurrently.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</span></p>
<p>Long term studies in animals have not been performed with clindamycin to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Genotoxicity tests performed included a rat micronucleus test and an Ames <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span> reversion test. Both tests were negative.</p>
<p>Fertility studies in rats treated orally with up to 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.1 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m2) revealed no effects on fertility or mating ability.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy: </span>Teratogenic effects</p>
<p>Pregnancy Category B</p>
<p>Reproduction studies performed in rats and mice using oral doses of clindamycin up to 600 mg/kg/day (2.1 and 1.1 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m2, respectively) or subcutaneous doses of clindamycin up to 250 mg/kg/day (0.9 and 0.5 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m2, respectively) revealed no evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span>.</p>
<p>There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers</span></p>
<p>Clindamycin has been reported to appear in breast milk in the range of 0.7 to 3.8 mcg/mL at dosages of 150 mg orally to 600 mg intravenously. Because of the potential for adverse reactions due to clindamycin in neonates (see <span class="Bold">Pediatric Use</span>), the decision to discontinue the drug should be made, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use</span></p>
<p>When CLEOCIN PHOSPHATE Sterile Solution is administered to the pediatric population (birth to 16 years) appropriate monitoring of organ system functions is desirable.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Usage in Newborns and Infants</span></p>
<p>This product contains benzyl alcohol as a preservative. Benzyl alcohol has been associated with fatal "<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">Gasping</span> Syndrome" in premature infants.</p>
<p>The potential for the toxic effect in the pediatric population from chemicals that may leach from the single dose premixed IV preparation in plastic has not been evaluated.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Geriatric Use</span></p>
<p>Clinical studies of clindamycin did not include sufficient numbers of patients age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. However, other reported clinical experience indicates that antibiotic-associated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4272488" conceptname="Colitis">colitis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span> (due to <span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span>) seen in association with most antibiotics occur more frequently in the elderly (&gt;60 years) and may be more severe. These patients should be carefully monitored for the development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>.</p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic studies with clindamycin have shown no clinically important differences between young and elderly subjects with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function after oral or intravenous administration.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">﻿Dilution and Compatibility: </span>﻿Physical and biological compatibility studies monitored for 24 hours at room temperature have demonstrated no inactivation or incompatibility with the use of CLEOCIN PHOSPHATE Sterile Solution (clindamycin phosphate) in IV solutions containing sodium chloride, glucose, calcium or potassium, and solutions containing vitamin B complex in concentrations usually used clinically. No incompatibility has been demonstrated with the antibiotics cephalothin, kanamycin, gentamicin, penicillin or carbenicillin.</p>
<p>The following drugs are physically incompatible with clindamycin phosphate: ampicillin sodium, phenytoin sodium, barbiturates, aminophylline, calcium gluconate, and magnesium sulfate.</p>
<p>The compatibility and duration of stability of drug admixtures will vary depending on concentration and other conditions. For current information regarding compatibilities of clindamycin phosphate under specific conditions, please contact the Medical and Drug Information Unit, Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Company (Division of Pfizer Inc).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Physico-Chemical Stability of diluted solutions of CLEOCIN PHOSPHATE</span></p>
<p>Room temperature: 6, 9 and 12 mg/mL (equivalent to clindamycin base) in dextrose injection 5%, sodium chloride injection 0.9%, or Lactated Ringers Injection in glass bottles or minibags, demonstrated physical and chemical stability for at least 16 days at 25°C. Also, 18 mg/mL (equivalent to clindamycin base) in dextrose injection 5%, in minibags, demonstrated physical and chemical stability for at least 16 days at 25°C.</p>

<h1>ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">One year oral toxicity studies in Spartan Sprague-Dawley rats and beagle dogs at dose levels up to 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.1 and 3.6 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m2, respectively) have shown clindamycin to be well tolerated. No appreciable difference in pathological findings has been observed between groups of animals treated with clindamycin and comparable control groups. Rats receiving clindamycin hydrochloride at 600 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.1 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m2) for 6 months tolerated the drug well; however, dogs dosed at this level (approximately 7.2 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m2) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomited</span>, would not eat, and lost weight.</p>
