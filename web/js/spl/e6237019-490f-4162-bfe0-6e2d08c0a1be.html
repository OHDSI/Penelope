<h1><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION</span></h1>
<p class="First">Flumazenil Injection, USP is a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. Chemically, flumazenil is ethyl 8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5-a](1,4) benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate. Flumazenil has an imidazobenzodiazepine structure, a calculated molecular weight of 303.3, and the following structural formula:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="Structural Formula" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=e6237019-490f-4162-bfe0-6e2d08c0a1be&amp;name=e6237019-490f-4162-bfe0-6e2d08c0a1be-01.jpg"></div>
<p>Flumazenil is a white to off-white crystalline compound with an octanol: buffer partition coefficient of 14 to 1 at pH 7.4. It is insoluble in water but slightly soluble in acidic aqueous solutions. Flumazenil injection is available as a sterile parenteral dosage form for intravenous administration. Each mL contains 0.1 mg of flumazenil compounded with 1.8 mg of methylparaben, 0.2 mg of propylparaben, 0.9% sodium chloride, 0.01% edetate disodium, and 0.01% acetic acid; the pH is adjusted to approximately 4 with hydrochloric acid and/or, if necessary, sodium hydroxide.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span></h1>
<p class="First">Flumazenil, an imidazobenzodiazepine derivative, antagonizes the actions of benzodiazepines on the central nervous system. Flumazenil competitively inhibits the activity at the benzodiazepine recognition site on the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex. Flumazenil is a weak partial agonist in some animal models of activity, but has little or no agonist activity in man.</p>
<p>Flumazenil does not antagonize the central nervous system effects of drugs affecting GABA-ergic neurons by means other than the benzodiazepine receptor (including ethanol, barbiturates, or general anesthetics) and does not reverse the effects of opioids.</p>
<p>In animals pretreated with high doses of benzodiazepines over several weeks, flumazenil elicited symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>. A similar effect was seen in adult human subjects.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Pharmacodynamics</span></h2>
<p class="First">Intravenous flumazenil has been shown to antagonize sedation, impairment of recall, psychomotor impairment and ventilatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> produced by benzodiazepines in healthy human volunteers.</p>
<p>The duration and degree of reversal of sedative benzodiazepine effects are related to the dose and plasma concentrations of flumazenil as shown in the following data from a study in normal volunteers.</p>
<div class="Figure">
<img alt="Chart 1" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=e6237019-490f-4162-bfe0-6e2d08c0a1be&amp;name=e6237019-490f-4162-bfe0-6e2d08c0a1be-02.jpg"><p class="MultiMediaCaption">Chart 1</p>
</div>
<p>Generally, doses of approximately 0.1 mg to 0.2 mg (corresponding to peak plasma levels of 3 to 6 ng/mL) produce partial antagonism, whereas higher doses of 0.4 to 1 mg (peak plasma levels of 12 to 28 ng/mL) usually produce complete antagonism in patients who have received the usual sedating doses of benzodiazepines. The onset of reversal is usually evident within 1 to 2 minutes after the injection is completed. Eighty percent response will be reached within 3 minutes, with the peak effect occurring at 6 to 10 minutes. The duration and degree of reversal are related to the plasma concentration of the sedating benzodiazepine as well as the dose of flumazenil given.</p>
<p>In healthy volunteers, flumazenil did not alter intraocular pressure when given alone and reversed the decrease in intraocular pressure seen after administration of midazolam.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span></h2>
<p class="First">After IV administration, plasma concentrations of flumazenil follow a two-exponential decay model. The pharmacokinetics of flumazenil are dose-proportional up to 100 mg.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">Flumazenil is extensively distributed in the extravascular space with an initial distribution half-life of 4 to 11 minutes and a terminal half-life of 40 to 80 minutes. Peak concentrations of flumazenil are proportional to dose, with an apparent initial volume of distribution of 0.5<span class="Italics"> </span>L/kg. The volume of distribution at steady-state is 0.9 to 1.1 L/kg. Flumazenil is a weak lipophilic base. Protein binding is approximately 50% and the drug shows no preferential partitioning into red blood cells. Albumin accounts for two thirds of plasma protein binding.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">Flumazenil is completely (99%) metabolized. Very little unchanged flumazenil (&lt;1%) is found in the urine. The major metabolites of flumazenil identified in urine are the de-ethylated free acid and its glucuronide conjugate. In preclinical studies there was no evidence of pharmacologic activity exhibited by the de-ethylated free acid.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Elimination</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">Elimination of radiolabeled drug is essentially complete within 72 hours, with 90% to 95%<span class="Italics"> </span>of the radioactivity appearing in urine and 5% to 10% in the feces. Clearance of flumazenil occurs primarily by hepatic metabolism and is dependent on hepatic blood flow. In pharmacokinetic studies of normal volunteers, total clearance ranged from 0.8 to 1.0 L/hr/kg.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Pharmacokinetics in Pediatric Patients</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of flumazenil have been evaluated in 29 pediatric patients ranging in age from 1 to 17 years who had undergone minor surgical procedures. The average doses administered were 0.53 mg (0.044 mg/kg) in patients aged 1 to 5years, 0.63 mg (0.020 mg/kg) in patients aged 6 to 12 years, and 0.8 mg (0.014 mg/kg) in patients aged 13 to 17 years. Compared to adults, the elimination half-life in pediatric patients was more variable, averaging 40 minutes (range: 20 to 75 minutes). Clearance and volume of distribution, normalized for body weight, were in the same range as those seen in adults, although more variability was seen in the pediatric patients.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">CLINICAL TRIALS</span></h1>
<p class="First">Flumazenil has been administered in adults to reverse the effects of benzodiazepines in conscious sedation, general anesthesia, and the management of suspected benzodiazepine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>.

<h2><span class="Bold">Conscious Sedation in Adults</span></h2>
<p class="First">Flumazenil was studied in four trials in 970 patients who received an average of 30 mg diazepam or 10 mg midazolam for sedation (with or without a narcotic) in conjunction with both inpatient and outpatient diagnostic or surgical procedures. Flumazenil was effective in reversing the sedating and psychomotor effects of the benzodiazepine; however, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439147" conceptname="Amnesia">amnesia</span> was less completely and less consistently reversed. In these studies, flumazenil was administered as an initial dose of 0.4 mg IV (two doses of 0.2 mg) with additional 0.2 mg doses as needed to achieve complete awakening, up to a maximum total dose of 1 mg.</p>
<p>Seventy-eight percent of patients receiving flumazenil responded by becoming completely alert. Of those patients, approximately half responded to doses of 0.4 mg to 0.6 mg, while the other half responded to doses of 0.8 mg to 1 mg. Adverse effects were infrequent in patients who received 1 mg of flumazenil or less, although <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4316207" conceptname="Injection site pain">injection site pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> did occur. Reversal of sedation was not associated with any increase in the frequency of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012238" conceptname="Inadequate analgesia">inadequate analgesia</span> or increase in narcotic demand in these studies. While most patients remained alert throughout the 3-hour postprocedure observation period, resedation was observed to occur in 3% to 9% of the patients, and was most common in patients who had received high doses of benzodiazepines (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_precautions_id_0c38a538-adcd-45ee-b0d7-6a9c61a635e3">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>).</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">General Anesthesia in Adults</span></h2>
<p class="First">Flumazenil was studied in four trials in 644 patients who received midazolam as an induction and/or maintenance agent in both balanced and inhalational anesthesia. Midazolam was generally administered in doses ranging from 5<span class="Italics"> </span>mg to 80 mg, alone and/or in conjunction with muscle relaxants, nitrous oxide, regional or local anesthetics, narcotics and/or inhalational anesthetics. Flumazenil was given as an initial dose of 0.2 mg IV, with additional 0.2 mg doses as needed to reach a complete response, up to a maximum total dose of 1 mg. These doses were effective in reversing sedation and restoring psychomotor function, but did not completely restore memory as tested by picture recall. Flumazenil was not as effective in the reversal of sedation in patients who had received multiple anesthetic agents in addition to benzodiazepines.</p>
<p>Eighty-one percent of patients sedated with midazolam responded to flumazenil by becoming completely alert or just slightly drowsy. Of those patients, 36% responded to doses of 0.4 mg to 0.6 mg, while 64% responded to doses of 0.8 mg to 1 mg.</p>
<p>Resedation in patients who responded to flumazenil occurred in 10% to 15%<span class="Italics"> </span>of patients studied and was more common with larger doses of midazolam (&gt;20 mg), long procedures (&gt;60 minutes) and use of neuromuscular blocking agents (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_precautions_id_0c38a538-adcd-45ee-b0d7-6a9c61a635e3">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>).</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Management of Suspected Benzodiazepine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">Overdose</span> in Adults</span></h2>
<p class="First">Flumazenil was studied in two trials in 497 patients who were presumed to have taken an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> of a benzodiazepine, either alone or in combination with a variety of other agents. In these trials, 299 patients were proven to have taken a benzodiazepine as part of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, and 80% of the 148 who received flumazenil responded by an improvement in level of consciousness. Of the patients who responded to flumazenil, 75% responded to a total dose of 1 mg to 3 mg.</p>
<p>Reversal of sedation was associated with an increased frequency of symptoms of CNS excitation. Of the patients treated with flumazenil, 1% to 3% were treated for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>. Serious side effects were uncommon, but six <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> were observed in 446 patients treated with flumazenil in these studies.

<h2><span class="Bold">General Principles</span></h2>
<p class="First">The serious adverse effects of flumazenil are related to the reversal of benzodiazepine effects. Using more than the minimally effective dose of flumazenil is tolerated by most patients but may complicate the management of patients who are physically dependent on benzodiazepines or patients who are depending on benzodiazepines for therapeutic effect (such as suppression of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> in cyclic antidepressant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>).</p>
<p>In high-risk patients, it is important to administer the smallest amount of flumazenil that is effective. The 1-minute wait between individual doses in the dose-titration recommended for general clinical populations may be too short for high-risk patients. This is because it takes 6 to 10 minutes for any single dose of flumazenil to reach full effects. Practitioners should slow the rate of administration of flumazenil administered to high-risk patients as recommended below.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Anesthesia and Conscious Sedation in Adult Patients</span></h2>
<p class="First">Flumazenil is well tolerated at the recommended doses in individuals who have no tolerance to (or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> on) benzodiazepines. The recommended doses and titration rates in anesthesia and conscious sedation (0.2 mg to 1 mg given at 0.2 mg/min) are well tolerated in patients receiving the drug for reversal of a single benzodiazepine exposure in most clinical settings (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_adverse_effects_id_44331618-568a-413d-9825-40ef27a71663">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span>).<span class="Bold"> </span>The major risk will be resedation because the duration of effect of a long-acting (or large dose of a short-acting) benzodiazepine may exceed that of flumazenil injection. Resedation may be treated by giving a repeat dose at no less than 20-minute intervals. For repeat treatment, no more than 1 mg (at 0.2 mg/min doses) should be given at any one time and no more than 3 mg should be given in any one hour.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312603" conceptname="Hypoventilation">Hypoventilation</span></span></h2>
<p class="First">Patients who have received flumazenil for the reversal of benzodiazepine effects (after conscious sedation or general anesthesia) should be monitored for resedation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, or other residual benzodiazepine effects for an appropriate period (up to 120 minutes) based on the dose and duration of effect of the benzodiazepine employed.</p>
<p>This is because flumazenil has not been established in patients as an effective treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312603" conceptname="Hypoventilation">hypoventilation</span> due to benzodiazepine administration. In healthy male volunteers, flumazenil is capable of reversing benzodiazepine-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> of the ventilatory responses to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4105765" conceptname="Hypercapnia">hypercapnia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxia</span> after a benzodiazepine alone. However, such <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> may recur because the ventilatory effects of typical doses of flumazenil (1 mg or less) may wear off before the effects of many benzodiazepines. The effects of flumazenil on ventilatory response following sedation with a benzodiazepine in combination with an opioid are inconsistent and have not been adequately studied. The availability of flumazenil does not diminish the need for prompt detection of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312603" conceptname="Hypoventilation">hypoventilation</span> and the ability to effectively intervene by establishing an airway and assisting ventilation.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">Overdose</span> cases should always be monitored for resedation until the patients are stable and resedation is unlikely.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Return of Sedation</span></h2>
<p class="First">Flumazenil may be expected to improve the alertness of patients recovering from a procedure involving sedation or anesthesia with benzodiazepines, but should not be substituted for an adequate period of postprocedure monitoring. The availability of flumazenil does not reduce the risks associated with the use of large doses of benzodiazepines for sedation.</p>
<p>Patients should be monitored for resedation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_warnings_id_33be85b6-569b-460e-af7e-34387d79ae39">WARNINGS</a></span>) or<span class="Bold"> </span>other persistent or recurrent agonist effects for an adequate period of time after administration of flumazenil.</p>
<p>Resedation is least likely in cases where flumazenil is administered to reverse a low dose of a short-acting benzodiazepine (&lt;10 mg midazolam). It is most likely in cases where a large single or cumulative dose of a benzodiazepine has been given in the course of a long procedure along with neuromuscular blocking agents and multiple anesthetic agents.</p>
<p>Profound resedation was observed in 1% to 3% of adult patients in the clinical studies. In clinical situations where resedation must be prevented in adult patients, physicians may wish to repeat the initial dose (up to 1 mg of flumazenil given at 0.2 mg/min) at 30 minutes and possibly again at 60 minutes. This dosage schedule, although not studied in clinical trials, was effective in preventing resedation in a pharmacologic study in normal volunteers.</p>
<p>The use of flumazenil to reverse the effects of benzodiazepines used for conscious sedation has been evaluated in one open-label clinical trial involving 107 pediatric patients between the ages of 1 and 17 years. This study suggested that pediatric patients who have become fully awake following treatment with flumazenil may experience a recurrence of sedation, especially younger patients (ages 1 to 5)<span class="Italics">. </span>Resedation was experienced in 7 of 60 patients who were fully alert 10 minutes after the start of flumazenil administration. No patient experienced a return to the baseline level of sedation. Mean time to resedation was 25 minutes (range: 19 to 50 minutes) (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_precautions_id_0c38a538-adcd-45ee-b0d7-6a9c61a635e3">PRECAUTIONS</a></span><span class="Bold">: </span><span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_pediatric_use_id_f0769c2a-f88e-449c-82a7-3bfdeb4e17e9">Pediatric Use</a></span>).<span class="Bold"> </span>The safety and effectiveness of repeated flumazenil administration in pediatric patients experiencing resedation have not been established.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Use in the ICU</span></p>
<p>Flumazenil should be used with caution in the ICU because of the increased risk of unrecognized benzodiazepine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> in such settings. Flumazenil may produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> in patients physically dependent on benzodiazepines (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_section_id_a13ad393-1429-409c-8566-9d8ef92b6f8c">INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DOSAGE</a></span><span class="Bold"> </span>and <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_warnings_id_33be85b6-569b-460e-af7e-34387d79ae39">WARNINGS</a></span>).</p>
<p>Administration of flumazenil to diagnose benzodiazepine-induced sedation in the ICU is not recommended due to the risk of adverse events as described above. In addition, the prognostic significance of a patient’s failure to respond to flumazenil in cases confounded by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436670" conceptname="Metabolic disease">metabolic disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433633" conceptname="Late effect of superficial injury">traumatic injury</span>, drugs other than benzodiazepines, or any other reasons not associated with benzodiazepine receptor occupancy is unknown.</p>

<p class="First">Flumazenil should be used with caution in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218106" conceptname="Alcoholism">alcoholism</span> and other drug dependencies due to the increased frequency of benzodiazepine tolerance and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> observed in these patient populations.</p>
<p>Flumazenil is not recommended either as a treatment for benzodiazepine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> or for the management of protracted benzodiazepine abstinence syndromes, as such use has not been studied.</p>
<p>The administration of flumazenil can precipitate benzodiazepine withdrawal in animals and man. This has been seen in healthy volunteers treated with therapeutic doses of oral lorazepam for up to 2 weeks who exhibited effects such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113666" conceptname="Menopausal flushing">hot flushes</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span> when treated with cumulative doses of up to 3 mg doses of flumazenil.</p>
<p>Similar adverse experiences suggestive of flumazenil precipitation of benzodiazepine withdrawal have occurred in some adult patients in clinical trials. Such patients had a short-lived syndrome characterized by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4078201" conceptname="Mood swings">emotional lability</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span> (with signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>), and mild sensory distortions. This response was dose-related, most common at doses above 1 mg, rarely required treatment other than reassurance and was usually short lived. When required, these patients (5<span class="Italics"> </span>to 10 cases) were successfully treated with usual doses of a barbiturate, a benzodiazepine, or other sedative drug.</p>
<p>Practitioners should assume that flumazenil administration may trigger dose-dependent withdrawal syndromes in patients with established physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> on benzodiazepines and may complicate the management of withdrawal syndromes for alcohol, barbiturates and cross-tolerant sedatives.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></h2>
<p class="First">Interaction with central nervous system depressants other than benzodiazepines has not been specifically studied; however, no deleterious interactions were seen when flumazenil was administered after narcotics, inhalational anesthetics, muscle relaxants and muscle relaxant antagonists administered in conjunction with sedation or anesthesia.</p>
<p>Particular caution is necessary when using flumazenil in cases of mixed drug overdosage since the toxic effects (such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac dysrhythmias</span>) of other drugs taken in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> (especially cyclic antidepressants) may emerge with the reversal of the benzodiazepine effect by flumazenil (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_warnings_id_33be85b6-569b-460e-af7e-34387d79ae39">WARNINGS</a></span>).</p>
<p>The use of flumazenil is not recommended in epileptic patients who have been receiving benzodiazepine treatment for a prolonged period. Although flumazenil exerts a slight intrinsic anticonvulsant effect, its abrupt suppression of the protective effect of a benzodiazepine agonist can give rise to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> in epileptic patients.</p>
<p>Flumazenil blocks the central effects of benzodiazepines by competitive interaction at the receptor level. The effects of nonbenzodiazepine agonists at benzodiazepine receptors, such as zopiclone, triazolopyridazines and others, are also blocked by flumazenil.</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of benzodiazepines are unaltered in the presence of flumazenil and vice versa.</p>
<p>There is no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interaction</span> between ethanol and flumazenil.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Use in Ambulatory Patients</span></h2>
<p class="First">The effects of flumazenil may wear off before a long-acting benzodiazepine is completely cleared from the body. In general, if a patient shows no signs of sedation within 2 hours after a 1-mg dose of flumazenil, serious resedation at a later time is unlikely. An adequate period of observation must be provided for any patient in whom either long-acting benzodiazepines (such as diazepam) or large doses of short-acting benzodiazepines (such as &gt;10 mg of midazolam) have been used (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_section_id_a13ad393-1429-409c-8566-9d8ef92b6f8c">INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DOSAGE</a></span>).</p>
<p>Because of the increased risk of adverse reactions in patients who have been taking benzodiazepines on a regular basis, it is particularly important that physicians query patients or their guardians carefully about benzodiazepine, alcohol and sedative use as part of the history prior to any procedure in which the use of flumazenil is planned (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_precautions_id_0c38a538-adcd-45ee-b0d7-6a9c61a635e3">PRECAUTIONS</a></span><span class="Bold">: </span><span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_section_id_a7b898ad-230a-4e95-b01a-96e434a65fe3">Use in Drug- and Alcohol-Dependent Patients</a></span><span class="Bold">).</span></p>

<p class="First">Flumazenil does not consistently reverse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439147" conceptname="Amnesia">amnesia</span>. Patients cannot be expected to remember information told to them in the postprocedure period and instructions given to patients should be reinforced in writing or given to a responsible family member. Physicians are advised to discuss with patients or their guardians, both before surgery and at discharge, that although the patient may feel alert at the time of discharge, the effects of the benzodiazepine (e.g., sedation) may recur. As a result, the patient should be instructed, preferably in writing, that their memory and judgment may be impaired and specifically advised:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not to engage in any activities requiring complete alertness, and not to operate hazardous machinery or a motor vehicle during the first 24 hours after discharge, and it is certain no residual sedative effects of the benzodiazepine remain.</li>
<li>Not to take any alcohol or non-prescription drugs during the first 24 hours after flumazenil administration or if the effects of the benzodiazepine persist.</li>

<h2><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use</span></h2>
<p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of flumazenil have been established in pediatric patients 1 year of age and older. Use of flumazenil in this age group is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of flumazenil in adults with additional data from uncontrolled pediatric studies including one open-label trial.</p>
<p>The use of flumazenil to reverse the effects of benzodiazepines used for conscious sedation was evaluated in one uncontrolled clinical trial involving 107 pediatric patients between the ages of 1 and 17 years. At the doses used, flumazenil’s safety was established in this population. Patients received up to 5 injections of 0.01 mg/kg flumazenil up to a maximum total dose of 1.0 mg at a rate not exceeding 0.2 mg/min. </p>
<p>Of 60 patients who were fully alert at 10 minutes, 7 experienced resedation. Resedation occurred between 19 and 50 minutes after the start of flumazenil administration. None of the patients experienced a return to the baseline level of sedation. All 7 patients were between the ages of 1 and 5<span class="Italics"> </span>years. The types and frequency of adverse events noted in these pediatric patients were similar to those previously documented in clinical trials with flumazenil to reverse conscious sedation in adults. No patient experienced a serious adverse event attributable to flumazenil.</p>
<p>The safety and efficacy of flumazenil in the reversal of conscious sedation in pediatric patients below the age of 1 year have not been established (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_clinical_pharmacology_id_c22a6e38-a19a-4675-bb3b-2ac75ab2183d">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span><span class="Bold">: </span><span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_section_id_92d618d3-c8a6-41b4-b67d-fe32da228586">Pharmacokinetics in Pediatric Patients</a></span>).</p>
<p>The safety and efficacy of flumazenil have not been established in pediatric patients for reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines used for induction of general anesthesia, for the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, or for the resuscitation of the newborn, as no well-controlled clinical studies have been performed to determine the risks, benefits and dosages to be used. However, published anecdotal reports discussing the use of flumazenil in pediatric patients for these indications have reported similar safety profiles and dosing guidelines to those described for the reversal of conscious sedation.</p>
<p>The risks identified in the adult population with flumazenil use also apply to pediatric patients. Therefore, consult the <span class="Bold"><span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_contraindications_id_1a721a93-065d-4746-93c2-94bd94f889c9">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span>, <a href="#i4i_warnings_id_33be85b6-569b-460e-af7e-34387d79ae39">WARNINGS</a>, <a href="#i4i_precautions_id_0c38a538-adcd-45ee-b0d7-6a9c61a635e3">PRECAUTIONS</a>, </span>and <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_adverse_effects_id_44331618-568a-413d-9825-40ef27a71663">ADVERSE REACTIONS </a></span> sections when using flumazenil in pediatric patients.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Geriatric Use</span></h2>
<p class="First">Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of flumazenil, 248 were 65 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of flumazenil have been studied in the elderly and are not significantly different from younger patients. Several studies of flumazenil in subjects over the age of 65 and one study in subjects over the age of 80 suggest that while the doses of benzodiazepine used to induce sedation should be reduced, ordinary doses of flumazenil may be used for reversal.</p>

<p class="First">For initial management of a known or suspected benzodiazepine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, the recommended initial dose of flumazenil injection is 0.2 mg (2 mL) administered intravenously over 30 seconds.

Further doses of 0.5 mg (5<span class="Italics"> </span>mL) can be administered over 30 seconds at 1-minute intervals up to a cumulative dose of 3 mg.</p>
<p>Do not rush the administration of flumazenil injection. Patients should have a secure airway and intravenous access before administration of the drug and be awakened gradually (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_precautions_id_0c38a538-adcd-45ee-b0d7-6a9c61a635e3">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>).</p>
<p>Most patients with a benzodiazepine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> will respond to a cumulative dose of 1 mg to 3 mg of flumazenil injection, and doses beyond 3 mg do not reliably produce additional effects.

<p>If a patient has not responded 5<span class="Italics"> </span>minutes after receiving a cumulative dose of 5<span class="Italics"> </span>mg of flumazenil injection, the major cause of sedation is likely not to be due to benzodiazepines, and additional flumazenil injection is likely to have no effect.</p>
<p>In the event of resedation, repeated doses may be given at 20-minute intervals if needed. For repeat treatment, no more than 1 mg (given as 0.5 mg/min) should be given at any one time and no more than 3 mg should be given in any one hour.</p>
