<h1>1  INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Benicar is indicated for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">strokes</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarctions</span>. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with Benicar.</p>
<p>Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).</p>
<p>Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, but reductions in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.</p>
<p>Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> (for example, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432867" conceptname="Hyperlipidemia">hyperlipidemia</span>), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment a lower blood pressure goal.</p>
<p>Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.</p>

<p class="First">Dosage must be individualized.  The usual recommended starting dose of Benicar is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted.  For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Benicar may be increased to 40 mg.  Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have greater effect.

<h2>6.1  Clinical Trials Experience</h2>
<p class="First">Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p>
<p>Benicar has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> in controlled trials. This experience included about 900 patients treated for at least 6 months and more than 525 for at least 1 year. Treatment with Benicar was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. Events generally were mild, transient and had no relationship to the dose of Benicar.
                                    <span class="Bold">Adult <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">Hypertension</span></span><br></p>
<p>The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose-related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Benicar and placebo-treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% (i.e., 79/3278) of patients treated with Benicar and 2.7% (i.e., 32/1179) of control patients. In placebo-controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Benicar and at a higher incidence versus placebo was <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span> (3% vs. 1%).</p>
<p>The following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Benicar, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134736" conceptname="Backache">back pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256451" conceptname="Bronchitis">bronchitis</span>, creatine phosphokinase increased, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75004" conceptname="Frank hematuria">hematuria</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440360" conceptname="Pure hyperglyceridemia">hypertriglyceridemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4266367" conceptname="Influenza">influenza</span>-like symptoms, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226263" conceptname="Pharyngitis">pharyngitis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4320791" conceptname="Rhinitis">rhinitis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4283893" conceptname="Sinusitis">sinusitis</span>.</p>

<p>Elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin were observed infrequently. Five patients (0.1%) assigned to Benicar and one patient (0.2%) assigned to placebo in clinical trials were withdrawn because of abnormal liver chemistries (transaminases or total bilirubin). Of the five Benicar patients, three had elevated transaminases, which were attributed to alcohol use, and one had a single elevated bilirubin value, which normalized while treatment continued.

<p>The epidemiologic study included patients 65 years and older with overall exposure of &gt; 300,000 patient-years. In the sub-group of diabetic patients receiving high-dose olmesartan (40 mg/d) for &gt; 6 months, there appeared to be an increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> (HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1, 3.8) compared to similar patients taking other angiotensin receptor blockers. In contrast, high-dose olmesartan use in non-diabetic patients appeared to be associated with a decreased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.24, 0.86) compared to similar patients taking other angiotensin receptor blockers. No differences were observed between the groups receiving lower doses of olmesartan compared to other angiotensin blockers or those receiving therapy for &lt; 6 months.</p>
<p>Overall, these data raise a concern of a possible increased CV risk associated with the use of high-dose olmesartan in diabetic patients. There are, however, concerns with the credibility of the finding of increased CV risk, notably the observation in the large epidemiologic study for a survival benefit in non-diabetics of a magnitude similar to the adverse finding in diabetics.</p>

<h1>11  DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Olmesartan medoxomil, a prodrug, is hydrolyzed to olmesartan during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.  Olmesartan is a selective AT subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist.
                            <span class="Sub">1</span></p>
<p>Olmesartan medoxomil is described chemically as 2,3-dihydroxy-2-butenyl 4-(1 hydroxy-1-methylethyl)-2-propyl-1-[ -( -1H-tetrazol-5-ylphenyl)benzyl]imidazole-5 carboxylate, cyclic 2,3-carbonate.
                            <span class="Italics">p</span><span class="Italics">o</span></p>

<h2>12.1  Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II).  Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137788" conceptname="Vascular constriction">vasoconstriction</span>, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium.  Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT receptor in vascular smooth muscle.  Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.
                                    <span class="Sub">1</span></p>
<p>An AT receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis.  Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT receptor than for the AT receptor.
                                    <span class="Sub">2</span><span class="Sub">1</span><span class="Sub">2</span></p>
<p>Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is a mechanism of many drugs used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>.  ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE.  Because olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin.  Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known.</p>
<p>Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.</p>

<h2>12.2  Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">Benicar doses of 2.5 mg to 40 mg inhibit the pressor effects of angiotensin I infusion.  The duration of the inhibitory effect was related to dose, with doses of Benicar &gt;40 mg giving &gt;90% inhibition at 24 hours.</p>
<p>Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II and plasma renin activity (PRA) increase after single and repeated administration of Benicar to healthy subjects and hypertensive patients.  Repeated administration of up to 80 mg Benicar had minimal influence on aldosterone levels and no effect on serum potassium.</p>

<h2>12.3  Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Olmesartan medoxomil is rapidly and completely bioactivated by ester hydrolysis to olmesartan during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.
                                    <span class="Bold">Absorption</span><br></p>
<p>Benicar tablets and the suspension formulation prepared from Benicar tablets are bioequivalent .
                                    <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration ]
                                        <a href="#de-a09e-0002a5d5c51b-jy22">(2.2)</a></span></p>
<p>The absolute bioavailability of olmesartan is approximately 26%.  After oral administration, the peak plasma concentration (C ) of olmesartan is reached after 1 to 2 hours.  Food does not affect the bioavailability of olmesartan.
                                    <span class="Sub">max</span></p>
<p>The volume of distribution of olmesartan is approximately 17 L.  Olmesartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (99%) and does not penetrate red blood cells.  The protein binding is constant at plasma olmesartan concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses.
                                    <span class="Bold">Distribution</span><br></p>
<p>In rats, olmesartan crossed the blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all.  Olmesartan passed across the placental barrier in rats and was distributed to the fetus.  Olmesartan was distributed to milk at low levels in rats.</p>
<p>Following the rapid and complete conversion of olmesartan medoxomil to olmesartan during absorption, there is virtually no further metabolism of olmesartan.  Total plasma clearance of olmesartan is 1.3 L/h, with a renal clearance of 0.6 L/h.  Approximately 35% to 50% of the absorbed dose is recovered in urine while the remainder is eliminated in feces via the bile.

<p>Olmesartan appears to be eliminated in a biphasic manner with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours.  Olmesartan shows linear pharmacokinetics following single oral doses of up to 320 mg and multiple oral doses of up to 80 mg.  Steady-state levels of olmesartan are achieved within 3 to 5 days and no accumulation in plasma occurs with once-daily dosing.</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of olmesartan were studied in the elderly (≥65 years).  Overall, maximum plasma concentrations of olmesartan were similar in young adults and the elderly.  Modest accumulation of olmesartan was observed in the elderly with repeated dosing; AUC , was 33% higher in elderly patients, corresponding to an approximate 30% reduction in CL .

<h2>13.1  Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Olmesartan medoxomil was not carcinogenic when administered by dietary administration to rats for up to 2 years.  The highest dose tested (2000 mg/kg/day) was, on a mg/m basis, about 480 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40 mg/day.  Two carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice, a 6-month gavage study in the p53 knockout mouse and a 6-month dietary administration study in the Hras2 transgenic mouse, at doses of up to 1000 mg/kg/day (about 120 times the MRHD), revealed no evidence of a carcinogenic effect of olmesartan medoxomil.
                                    <span class="Sup">2</span></p>
<p>Both olmesartan medoxomil and olmesartan tested negative in the Syrian hamster embryo cell transformation assay and showed no evidence of genetic toxicity in the Ames (bacterial mutagenicity) test.  However, both were shown to induce chromosomal aberrations in cultured cells (Chinese hamster lung) and tested positive for thymidine kinase mutations in the mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> assay.  Olmesartan medoxomil tested negative for mutations in the MutaMouse intestine and kidney and for clastogenicity in mouse bone marrow (micronucleus test) at oral doses of up to 2000 mg/kg (olmesartan not tested).

<p>Fertility of rats was unaffected by administration of olmesartan medoxomil at dose levels as high as 1000 mg/kg/day (240 times the MRHD) in a study in which dosing was begun 2 (female) or 9 (male) weeks prior to mating.</p>

<h2>13.2  Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h2>
<p class="First">No teratogenic effects were observed when olmesartan medoxomil was administered to pregnant rats at oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (240 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of olmesartan medoxomil on a mg/m basis) or pregnant rabbits at oral doses up to 1 mg/kg/day (half the MRHD on a mg/m basis; higher doses could not be evaluated for effects on fetal development as they were lethal to the does).  In rats, significant decreases in pup birth weight and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span> were observed at doses ≥1.6 mg/kg/day, and delays in developmental milestones (delayed separation of ear auricula, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">eruption</span> of lower incisors, appearance of abdominal hair, descent of testes, and separation of eyelids) and dose-dependent increases in the incidence of dilation of the renal pelvis were observed at doses ≥8 mg/kg/day.  The no observed effect dose for developmental toxicity in rats is 0.3 mg/kg/day, about one-tenth the MRHD of 40 mg/day.

<h2>14.1  Adult <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">Hypertension</span></h2>
<p class="First">The antihypertensive effects of Benicar have been demonstrated in seven placebo controlled studies at doses ranging from 2.5 mg to 80 mg for 6 to 12 weeks, each showing statistically significant reductions in peak and trough blood pressure.  A total of 2693 patients (2145 Benicar; 548 placebo) with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320128" conceptname="Essential hypertension">essential hypertension</span> were studied.  Benicar once daily lowered diastolic and systolic blood pressure.  The response was dose-related, as shown in the following graph.  A Benicar dose of 20 mg daily produces a trough sitting BP reduction over placebo of about 10/6 mmHg and a dose of 40 mg daily produces a trough sitting BP reduction over placebo of about 12/7 mmHg.  Benicar doses greater than 40 mg had little additional effect.  The onset of the antihypertensive effect occurred within 1 week and was largely manifest after 2 weeks.</p>
<p><img alt="Benicar Dose Response: Placebo-adjusted Reduction in Blood Pressure (mm Hg)" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=b2d10788-e0e4-4ee8-8c47-d7f7ed44e3d9&amp;name=benicar-figure-2.jpg"></p>
<p>Data above are from seven placebo-controlled studies (2145 Benicar patients, 548 placebo patients).  The blood pressure lowering effect was maintained throughout the 24-hour period with Benicar once daily, with trough-to-peak ratios for systolic and diastolic response between 60 and 80%.</p>
<p>The blood pressure lowering effect of Benicar, with and without hydrochlorothiazide, was maintained in patients treated for up to 1 year.  There was no evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052861" conceptname="Tachyphylaxis">tachyphylaxis</span> during long-term treatment with Benicar or rebound effect following abrupt withdrawal of olmesartan medoxomil after 1 year of treatment.</p>
<p>The antihypertensive effect of Benicar was similar in men and women and in patients older and younger than 65 years.  The effect was smaller in black patients (usually a low renin population), as has been seen with ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers and other angiotensin receptor blockers.  Benicar had an additional blood pressure lowering effect when added to hydrochlorothiazide.</p>
<p>There are no trials of Benicar demonstrating reductions in cardiovascular risk in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, but at least one pharmacologically similar drug has demonstrated such benefits.</p>

<h2>14.2  Pediatric <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">Hypertension</span></h2>
<p class="First">The antihypertensive effects of Benicar in the pediatric population were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind study involving 302 hypertensive patients aged 6 to 16 years.  The study population consisted of an all black cohort of 112 patients and a mixed racial cohort of 190 patients, including 38 blacks.  The etiology of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> was predominantly <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320128" conceptname="Essential hypertension">essential hypertension</span> (87% of the black cohort and 67% of the mixed cohort).  Patients who weighed 20 to &lt;35 kg were randomized to 2.5 or 20 mg of Benicar once daily and patients who weighed ≥35 kg were randomized to 5 or 40 mg of Benicar once daily.  At the end of 3 weeks, patients were re-randomized to continuing Benicar or to taking placebo for up to 2 weeks.  During the initial dose-response phase, Benicar significantly reduced both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in a weight-adjusted dose-dependent manner.  Overall, the two dose levels of Benicar (low and high) significantly reduced systolic blood pressure by 6.6 and 11.9 mmHg from the baseline, respectively.  These reductions in systolic blood pressure included both drug and placebo effect.    During the randomized withdrawal to placebo phase, mean systolic blood pressure at trough was 3.2 mmHg lower and mean diastolic blood pressure at trough was 2.8 mmHg lower in patients continuing Benicar than in patients withdrawn to placebo.  These differences were statistically different. As observed in adult populations, the blood pressure reductions were smaller in black patients.</p>
<p>In the same study, 59 patients aged 1 to 5 years who weighed ≥5 kg received 0.3 mg/kg of Benicar once daily for three weeks in an open label phase and then were randomized to receiving Benicar or placebo in a double-blind phase. At the end of the second week of withdrawal, the mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure at trough was 3/3 mmHg lower in the group randomized to Benicar; this difference in blood pressure was not statistically significant (95% C.I. -2 to 7/-1 to 7).</p>
