<p>Glabellar facial lines arise from the activity of the lateral corrugator and vertical procerus muscles. These can be readily identified by palpating the tensed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4152202" conceptname="Form of muscle">muscle mass</span> while having the patient frown. The corrugator depresses the skin creating a "furrowed" vertical line surrounded by tensed muscle (i.e., frown lines). The location, size, and use of the muscles vary markedly among individuals. Physicians administering DYSPORT<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> must understand the relevant neuromuscular and/or orbital anatomy of the area involved and any alterations to the anatomy due to prior surgical procedures.</p>
<p>Risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373194" conceptname="Paralytic ptosis">ptosis</span> can be mitigated by careful examination of the upper lid for separation or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">weakness</span> of the levator palpebrae muscle (true <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373194" conceptname="Paralytic ptosis">ptosis</span>), identification of lash <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373194" conceptname="Paralytic ptosis">ptosis</span>, and evaluation of the range of lid excursion while manually depressing the frontalis to assess compensation.</p>
<p>In order to reduce the complication of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373194" conceptname="Paralytic ptosis">ptosis</span>, the following steps should be taken:</p>
<ul class="Disc">
<li>Avoid injection near the levator palpebrae superioris, particularly in patients with larger brow depressor complexes.</li>
<li>Medial corrugator injections should be placed at least 1 centimeter above the bony supraorbital ridge.</li>
<li>Ensure the injected volume/dose is accurate and where feasible kept to a minimum.</li>
<li>Do not inject toxin closer than 1 centimeter above the central eyebrow.</li>
</ul>
<p>To inject DYSPORT<span class="Sup">®</span>, advance the needle through the skin into the underlying muscle while applying finger pressure on the superior medial orbital rim. Inject patients with a total of 50 Units in five equally divided aliquots. Using a 30 gauge needle, inject 10 Units of DYSPORT<span class="Sup">®</span> into each of five sites, two in each corrugator muscle, and one in the procerus muscle (<span class="Italics">see <a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a></span>).</p>

<p class="First">Treatment with DYSPORT<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> and other botulinum toxin products can result in swallowing or breathing difficulties. Patients with pre-existing swallowing or breathing difficulties may be more susceptible to these complications. In most cases, this is a consequence of weakening of muscles in the area of injection that are involved in breathing or swallowing. When distant effects occur, additional respiratory muscles may be involved [<span class="Italics">see <a href="#S5.2">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</a></span>].</p>

<p>Treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440814" conceptname="Torticollis">cervical dystonia</span> with botulinum toxins may weaken neck muscles that serve as accessory muscles of ventilation.

<h2>6.3 Immunogenicity</h2>
<p class="First">As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity.</p>
<p>The incidence of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. In addition, the observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies across products in this class may be misleading.</p>

<p>Patients treated concomitantly with botulinum toxins and aminoglycosides or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (e.g., curare-like agents) should be observed closely because the effect of the botulinum toxin may be potentiated.

<h1>11 DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Botulinum toxin type A, the active ingredient in DYSPORT<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> (abobotulinumtoxinA), is a purified neurotoxin type A complex produced by fermentation of the bacterium <span class="Italics">Clostridium botulinum</span> type A, Hall <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">Strain</span>. It is purified from the culture supernatant by a series of precipitation, dialysis, and chromatography steps. The neurotoxin complex is composed of the neurotoxin, hemagglutinin proteins and non-toxin non-hemagglutinin protein.</p>
<p>DYSPORT<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> is supplied in a single-use, sterile vial for reconstitution intended for intramuscular injection. Each vial contains 500 or 300 Units of lyophilized abobotulinumtoxinA, 125 micrograms human serum albumin and 2.5 mg lactose. DYSPORT<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> may contain trace amounts of cow's milk proteins [<span class="Italics">see <a href="#S4">Contraindications (4)</a></span>].</p>
<p>One unit of DYSPORT<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> corresponds to the calculated median lethal intraperitoneal dose (LD50) in mice. The method for performing the assay is specific to Ipsen's product DYSPORT<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span>. Due to differences in specific details such as vehicle, dilution scheme and laboratory protocols for various mouse LD50 assays, Units of biological activity of DYSPORT<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> are not interchangeable with Units of any other botulinum toxin or any toxin assessed with any other specific assay method [<span class="Italics">see <a href="#S3">Dosage Forms and Strengths (3)</a></span>].</p>

<h2>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">DYSPORT<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> inhibits release of the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, from peripheral cholinergic nerve endings. Toxin activity occurs in the following sequence: Toxin heavy chain mediated binding to specific surface receptors on nerve endings, internalization of the toxin by receptor mediated endocytosis, pH-induced translocation of the toxin light chain to the cell cytosol and cleavage of SNAP25 leading to intracellular blockage of neurotransmitter exocytosis into the neuromuscular junction. This accounts for the therapeutic utility of the toxin in diseases characterized by excessive efferent activity in motor nerves.</p>
<p>Recovery of transmission occurs gradually as the neuromuscular junction recovers from SNAP25 cleavage and as new nerve endings are formed.</p>

<h2>12.2 Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">The primary pharmacodynamic effect of DYSPORT<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> is due to chemical denervation of the treated muscle resulting in a measurable decrease of the compound muscle action potential, causing a localized reduction of muscle activity.</p>

<h2>14.1 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440814" conceptname="Torticollis">Cervical Dystonia</span></h2>
<p class="First">The efficacy of DYSPORT<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> was evaluated in two well-controlled, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, single dose, parallel group studies in treatment-naïve <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440814" conceptname="Torticollis">cervical dystonia</span> patients. The principal analyses from these trials provide the primary demonstration of efficacy involving 252 patients (121 on DYSPORT<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span>, 131 on placebo) with 36% male and 64% female. Ninety-nine percent of the patients were Caucasian.</p>
<p>In both placebo controlled studies (Study 1 and Study 2), a dose of 500 Units DYSPORT<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> was given by intramuscular injection divided among two to four affected muscles. These studies were followed by long-term open label extensions that allowed titration in 250 Unit steps to doses in a range of 250 to 1000 Units, after the initial dose of 500 Units. In the extension studies, re-treatment was determined by clinical need after a minimum of 12 weeks. The median time to re-treatment was 14 weeks and 18 weeks for the 75<span class="Sup">th</span> percentile.</p>
<p>The primary assessment of efficacy was based on the total Toronto Western Spasmodic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440814" conceptname="Torticollis">Torticollis</span> Rating Scale (TWSTRS) change from baseline at Week 4 for both studies.

<h2>14.2 Glabellar Lines</h2>
<p class="First">Three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical studies evaluated the efficacy of DYSPORT<span class="Sup">®</span> for use in the temporary improvement of the appearance of moderate to severe glabellar lines. These three studies enrolled healthy adults (ages 19-75) with glabellar lines of at least moderate severity at maximum frown. Subjects were excluded if they had marked <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373194" conceptname="Paralytic ptosis">ptosis</span>, deep dermal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4050007" conceptname="Scar">scarring</span>, or a substantial inability to lessen glabellar lines, even by physically spreading them apart. The subjects in these studies received either DYSPORT<span class="Sup">®</span> or placebo. The total dose was delivered in equally divided aliquots to specified injection sites (<span class="Italics">see <a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a></span>).</p>
<p>Investigators and subjects assessed efficacy at maximum frown by using a 4-point scale (none, mild, moderate, severe).</p>
<p>Overall treatment success was defined as post-treatment glabellar line severity of none or mild with at least 2 grade improvement from Baseline for the combined investigator and subject assessments (composite assessment) on Day 30 (<span class="Italics">see <a href="#table6">Table 6</a></span>). Additional endpoints for each of the studies were post-treatment glabellar line severity of none or mild with at least a 1 grade improvement from Baseline for the separate investigator and subject assessments on Day 30.</p>
<p>After completion of the randomized studies, subjects were offered participation in a two-year, open-label re-treatment study to assess the safety of multiple treatments.</p>
<p><img alt="table-06" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=71313a04-1349-4c26-b840-a39e4a3ddaed&amp;name=table-06.jpg"></p>

See "<a href="#avoid">What should I avoid while receiving DYSPORT®?</a>".</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What is DYSPORT<span class="Sup">®</span>?</span></p>
<p>DYSPORT<span class="Sup">®</span> is a prescription medicine that is injected into muscles and used:</p>
<ul class="Disc">
<li>to treat the abnormal head position and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24134" conceptname="Neck pain">neck pain</span> that happens with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440814" conceptname="Torticollis">cervical dystonia</span> (CD) in adults</li>
<li>to improve the look of moderate to severe frown lines between the eyebrows (glabellar lines) in adults younger than 65 years of age for a short period of time (temporary)</li>
</ul>
<p>CD is caused by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75635" conceptname="Cramp">muscle spasms</span> in the neck. These <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75635" conceptname="Cramp">spasms</span> cause abnormal position of the head and often <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24134" conceptname="Neck pain">neck pain</span>. After DYSPORT<span class="Sup">®</span> is injected into muscles, those muscles are weakened for up to 12 to 16 weeks or longer. This may help lessen your symptoms.</p>
<p>Frown lines (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkles</span>) happen because the muscles that control facial expression are used often (muscle tightening over and over). After DYSPORT<span class="Sup">®</span> is injected into the muscles that control facial expression, the medicine stops the tightening of these muscles for up to 4 months.</p>
<p>It is not known whether DYSPORT<span class="Sup">®</span> is safe or effective in children under 18 years of age.</p>
<p>It is not known whether DYSPORT<span class="Sup">®</span> is safe or effective for the treatment of other types of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75635" conceptname="Cramp">muscle spasms</span>.
