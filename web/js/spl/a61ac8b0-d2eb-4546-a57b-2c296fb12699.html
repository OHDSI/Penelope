<h1><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION</span></h1>
<p class="First">LOXITANE, loxapine, a dibenzoxazepine compound, represents a subclass of tricyclic antipsychotic agents, chemically distinct from the thioxanthenes, butyrophenones, and phenothiazines. Chemically, it is 2-Chloro-11-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)dibenz[<span class="Italics">b,f</span>][1,4] oxazepine. It is present as the succinate salt.</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="structural formula for loxapine" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=a61ac8b0-d2eb-4546-a57b-2c296fb12699&amp;name=loxitane-1.jpg"></div>
<p>Each capsule for oral administration, contains loxapine succinate USP 6.8, 13.6, 34.0 or 68.1 mg equivalent to 5, 10, 25 or 50 mg of loxapine base respectively. It also contains the following inactive ingredients: gelatin, silicon dioxide, NF, sodium lauryl sulfate, NF, anhydrousÂ lactose, D &amp; C Yellow 10, FD&amp;C Blue 1, polacrilin potassium, magnesium stearate, talc, andÂ titanium dioxide. Additionally, the 5 mg capsule contains D &amp; C Red 33, the 10 mg capsuleÂ contains D &amp; C Red 28 and D &amp; C Red 33, and the 25 mg capsule contains FD &amp; C Yellow 6.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Pharmacodynamics:</span></h2>
<p class="First">Pharmacologically, loxapine is an antipsychotic for which the exact mode of action has notÂ been established. However, changes in the level of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">excitability</span> of subcortical inhibitory areasÂ have been observed in several animal species in association with such manifestations of tranquilization as calming effects and suppression of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021344" conceptname="Abusive behavior">aggressive behavior</span>.</p>
<p>In normal human volunteers, signs of sedation were seen within 20 to 30 minutes afterÂ administration, were most pronounced within one and one-half to three hours, and lastedÂ through 12 hours. Similar timing of primary pharmacologic effects was seen in animals.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion</span></h2>
<p class="First">Absorption of loxapine following oral or parenteral administration is virtually complete. TheÂ drug is removed rapidly from the plasma and distributed in tissues. Animal studies suggestÂ an initial preferential distribution in lungs, brain, spleen, heart, and kidney. Loxapine is metabolized extensively and is excreted mainly in the first 24 hours. Metabolites are excreted in the urine in the form of conjugates and in the feces unconjugated.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">Tardive Dyskinesia</span></span></h2>
<p class="First"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">Tardive dyskinesia</span>, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskineticÂ movements, may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalenceÂ of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, itÂ is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychoticÂ treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drugÂ products differ in their potential to cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> is unknown.</p>
<p>Both the risk of developing the syndrome and the likelihood that it will become irreversibleÂ are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop,Â although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.</p>
<p>There is no known treatment for established cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>, although the syndromeÂ may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn.Â Antipsychotic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs andÂ symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying disease process.Â The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndromeÂ is unknown.</p>
<p>Given these considerations, antipsychotics should be prescribed in a manner that is mostÂ likely to minimize the occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>. Chronic antipsychotic treatmentÂ should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that, 1) is knownÂ to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentiallyÂ less harmful treatments are <span class="Italics">not </span>available or appropriate. In patients who do requireÂ chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should beÂ reassessed periodically.</p>
<p>If signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> appear in a patient on antipsychotics, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment despite theÂ presence of the syndrome.

<h2><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="379802" conceptname="Neuroleptic malignant syndrome">Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome</span> (NMS)</span></h2>
<p class="First">A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic MalignantÂ Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260205" conceptname="Hyperpyrexia">hyperpyrexia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4050941" conceptname="Muscle rigidity">muscle rigidity</span>, altered mental status, and evidence ofÂ <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434633" conceptname="Disorder of autonomic nervous system">autonomic instability</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4088122" conceptname="Heart irregular">irregular pulse</span> or blood pressure, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">diaphoresis</span>, and cardiacÂ <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">dysrhythmias</span>).</p>
<p>The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving atÂ a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes bothÂ serious medical illness (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255848" conceptname="Pneumonia">pneumonia</span>, systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, etc.) and untreated or inadequatelyÂ treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerationsÂ in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4181404" conceptname="Heat stroke">heat stroke</span>,Â <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">drug fever</span>, and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.</p>
<p>The management of NMS should include: 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychoticÂ drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomaticÂ treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant seriousÂ medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreementÂ about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.</p>
<p>If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potentialÂ reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should beÂ carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.</p>
<p>LOXITANE, like other antipsychotics, may impair mental and/or physical abilities,Â especially during the first few days of therapy. Therefore, ambulatory patients should beÂ warned about activities requiring alertness (e.g., operating vehicles or machinery) andÂ about concomitant use of alcohol and other CNS depressants.</p>
<p>LOXITANE has not been evaluated for the management of behavioral complications inÂ patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440389" conceptname="Mental retardation">mental retardation</span>, and therefore, it cannot be recommended.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">General</span></h2>
<p class="First">LOXITANE should be used with extreme caution in patients with a history of convulsiveÂ disorders since it lowers the convulsive threshold. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">Seizures</span> have been reported inÂ patients receiving LOXITANE at antipsychotic dose levels, and may occur in epilepticÂ patients even with maintenance of routine anticonvulsant drug therapy.</p>
<p>LOXITANE has an antiemetic effect in animals. Since this effect may also occur in man,Â LOXITANE may mask signs of overdosage of toxic drugs and may obscure conditionsÂ such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="193518" conceptname="Intestinal obstruction">intestinal obstruction</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4116092" conceptname="Intracranial tumor">brain tumor</span>.</p>
<p>LOXITANE should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>Increased pulse rates have been reported in the majority of patients receiving antipsychoticÂ doses; transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> has been reported. In the presence of severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> requiring vasopressor therapy, the preferred drugs may be norepinephrine or angiotensin. Usual doses of epinephrine may be ineffective because of inhibition of its vasopressor effect by LOXITANE.</p>
<p>The possibility of ocular toxicity from loxapine cannot be excluded at this time.Â Therefore, careful observation should be made for pigmentary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="376103" conceptname="Retinopathy">retinopathy</span> and lenticularÂ <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4083855" conceptname="Abnormal pigment">pigmentation</span> since these have been observed in some patients receiving certain otherÂ antipsychotic drugs for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4088438" conceptname="Prolonged periods">prolonged periods</span>.</p>
<p>Because of possible anticholinergic action, the drug should be used cautiously inÂ patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437541" conceptname="Glaucoma">glaucoma</span> or a tendency to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192450" conceptname="Retention of urine">urinary retention</span>, particularly with concomitantÂ administration of anticholinergic-type antiparkinson medication.</p>
<p>Experience to date indicates the possibility of a slightly higher incidence of extrapyramidalÂ effects following intramuscular administration than normally anticipated with oral formulations. The increase may be attributable to higher plasma levels following intramuscular injection.</p>
<p>Antipsychotic drugs elevate prolactin levels; the elevation persists during chronicÂ administration. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third ofÂ human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>, a factor of potential importanceÂ if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with a previously detectedÂ breast cancer. Although disturbances such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79884" conceptname="Galactorrhea not associated with childbirth">galactorrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443800" conceptname="Amenorrhea">amenorrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168447" conceptname="Gynecomastia">gynecomastia</span>,Â and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">impotence</span> have been reported, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactinÂ levels is unknown for most patients. An increase in mammary neoplasms has beenÂ found in rodents after chronic administration of antipsychotic drugs. Neither clinicalÂ studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date, however, have shown an associationÂ between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis; theÂ available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Pregnancy</span></h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Non-teratogenic Effects</span></p>
<p>Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208994" conceptname="Increased muscle tone">hypertonia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">hypotonia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4158346" conceptname="Respiratory distress">respiratory distress</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434750" conceptname="Feeding difficulties and mismanagement">feeding disorder</span> in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity; while in some cases symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization.</p>
<p>Loxapine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<p>Safe use of LOXITANE during pregnancy or lactation has not been established; therefore,Â its use in pregnancy, in nursing mothers, or in women of childbearing potential requiresÂ that the benefits of treatment be weighed against the possible risks to mother and child.Â No embryotoxicity or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> was observed in studies in rats, rabbits, or dogsÂ although, with the exception of one rabbit study, the highest dosage was only two timesÂ the maximum recommended human dosage and in some studies it was below this dose.Â Perinatal studies have shown renal papillary abnormalities in offspring of rats treated fromÂ mid-pregnancy with doses of 0.6 and 1.8 mg/kg, doses which approximate the usual humanÂ dose but which are considerably below the maximum recommended human dose.</p>

<p>Symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375800" conceptname="Dystonia">dystonia</span>, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">difficulty breathing</span>, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375800" conceptname="Dystonia">acute dystonia</span> is observed in males and younger age groups.</p>

The symptoms are persistent and in some patients appear to be irreversible. The syndrome is characterized by rhythmical involuntary movement of the tongue, face, mouth or jaw (e.g., protrusion of tongue, puffing of cheeks, puckering of mouth, chewing movements). Sometimes these may be accompanied by involuntary movements of extremities.</p>
<p>There is no known effective treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>; antiparkinson agents usuallyÂ do not alleviate the symptoms of this syndrome. It is suggested that all antipsychotic agentsÂ be discontinued if these symptoms appear. Should it be necessary to reinstitute treatment, orÂ increase the dosage of the agent, or switch to a different antipsychotic agent, the syndromeÂ may be masked. It has been suggested that fine vermicular movements of the tongue may beÂ an early sign of the syndrome, and if the medication is stopped at that time the syndromeÂ may not develop.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span></h1>
<p class="First">Signs and symptoms of overdosage will depend on the amount ingested and individual patient tolerance. As would be expected from the pharmacologic actions of the drug, the clinical findings may range from mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> of the CNS and cardiovascular systems to profoundÂ <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372448" conceptname="Loss of consciousness">unconsciousness</span>.

<p>The treatment of overdosage is essentially symptomatic and supportive. Early gastric lavage and extended dialysis might be expected to be beneficial. Centrally-acting emetics may have little effect because of the antiemetic action of loxapine. In addition, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> should be avoided because of the possibility of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span> of vomitus. Avoid analeptics, such as pentylenetetrazol, which may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>. Severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> might be expected to respond to the administration of norepinephrine or phenylephrine. <span class="Bold">EPINEPHRINE SHOULD</span>Â <span class="Bold">NOT BE USED SINCE ITS USE IN A PATIENT WITH PARTIAL ADRENERGIC BLOCKADE MAY</span>Â <span class="Bold">FURTHER LOWER THE BLOOD PRESSURE. </span>Severe extrapyramidal reactions should be treated with anticholinergic antiparkinson agents or diphenhydramine hydrochloride, and anticonvulsant therapy should be initiated as indicated.

<h1><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span></h1>
<p class="First">LOXITANE is administered, usually in divided doses, two to four times a day. Daily dosage (in terms of base equivalents) should be adjusted to the individual patientâ€™s needs as assessed by the severity of symptoms and previous history of response to antipsychotic drugs.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Oral Administration</span></h2>
<p class="First">Initial dosage of 10 mg twice daily is recommended, although in severely disturbed patients initial dosage up to a total of 50 mg daily may be desirable. Dosage should then be increased fairly rapidly over the first seven to ten days until there is effective control of symptoms of schizoprenia. The usual therapeutic and maintenance range is 60 mg to 100 mg daily. However, as with other drugs used to treat schizoprenia, some patients respond to lower dosage and others require higher dosage for optimal benefit. Daily dosage higher than 250 mg is not recommended.</p>
