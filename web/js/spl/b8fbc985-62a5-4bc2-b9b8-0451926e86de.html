<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Pharmacologically, clorazepate dipotassium has the characteristics of the benzodiazepines. It has depressant effects on the central nervous system. The primary metabolite, nordiazepam, quickly appears in the blood stream. The serum half-life is about 2 days. The drug is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in the urine.</p>
<p>Studies in healthy men have shown that clorazepate dipotassium has depressant effects on the central nervous system. Prolonged administration of single daily doses as high as 120 mg was without toxic effects. Abrupt cessation of high doses was followed in some patients by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436817" conceptname="Feeling nervous">nervousness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442752" conceptname="Muscle pain">muscle aches</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4304008" conceptname="Memory impairment">memory impairment</span>.</p>
<p>Since orally administered clorazepate dipotassium is rapidly decarboxylated to form nordiazepam, there is essentially no circulating parent drug. Nordiazepam, the primary metabolite, quickly appears in the blood and is eliminated from the plasma with an apparent half-life of about 40 to 50 hours. Plasma levels of nordiazepam increase proportionally with Clorazepate Dipotassium dose and show moderate accumulation with repeated administration. The protein binding of nordiazepam in plasma is high (97-98%).</p>
<p>Within 10 days after oral administration of a 15 mg (50µCi) dose of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-Clorazepate Dipotassium to two volunteers, 62-67% of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine and 15-19% was eliminated in the feces. Both subjects were still excreting measurable amounts of radioactivity in the urine (about l% of the <span class="Sup">14</span>C-dose) on day ten.</p>
<p>Nordiazepam is further metabolized by hydroxylation. The major urinary metabolite is conjugated oxazepam (3-hydroxynordiazepam), and smaller amounts of conjugated p-hydroxynordiazepam and nordiazepam are also found in the urine.</p>

<p class="First">Withdrawal symptoms (similar in character to those noted with barbiturates and alcohol) have occurred following abrupt discontinuance of clorazepate. Withdrawal symptoms associated with the abrupt discontinuation of benzodiazepines have included <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373995" conceptname="Delirium">delirium</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span>, abdominal and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75635" conceptname="Cramp">muscle cramps</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436817" conceptname="Feeling nervous">nervousness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4304008" conceptname="Memory impairment">memory impairment</span>. The more severe withdrawal symptoms have usually been limited to those patients who had received excessive doses over an extended period of time. Generally milder withdrawal symptoms have been reported following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines taken continuously at therapeutic levels for several months. Consequently, after extended therapy, abrupt discontinuation of clorazepate should generally be avoided and a gradual dosage tapering schedule followed.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322252" conceptname="Suicidal behavior">Suicidal Behavior</span> and Ideation</h2>
<p class="First">Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including clorazepate dipotassium, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</p>
<p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322252" conceptname="Suicidal behavior">suicidal behavior</span> or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>.</p>
<p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</p>
<p>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.</p>

<h2>Usage in Pregnancy</h2>
<p class="First">An increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of minor tranquilizers (chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, and meprobamate) during the first trimester of pregnancy has been suggested in several studies. Clorazepate dipotassium, a benzodiazepine derivative, has not been studied adequately to determine whether it, too, may be associated with an increased risk of fetal abnormality. Because use of these drugs is rarely a matter of urgency, their use during this period should almost always be avoided. The possibility that a woman of childbearing potential may be pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. Patients should be advised that if they become pregnant during therapy or intend to become pregnant they should communicate with their physician about the desirability of discontinuing the drug.</p>
<p>To provide information regarding the effects of<span class="Italics"> in utero </span>exposure to clorazepate dipotassium, physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking clorazepate dipotassium enroll in the North American Anti-epileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll-free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/.</p>

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">To assure the safe and effective use of benzodiazepines, patients should be informed that, since benzodiazepines may produce psychological and physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>, it is essential that they consult with their physician before either increasing the dose or abruptly discontinuing this drug.</p>
<p>Patients, their caregivers, and families should be counseled that AEDs, including clorazepate dipotassium, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm.

<p>Patients should be encouraged to enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. To enroll, patients can call the toll-free number 1-888-233-2334 (see<span class="Bold"><a href="#uip"> Usage in Pregnancy</a></span>).</p>
<p>Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with clorazepate dipotassium and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide is available for clorazepate dipotassium. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of clorazepate dipotassium were not adequate to determine whether subjects aged 65 and over respond differently than younger subjects. Elderly or debilitated patients may be especially sensitive to the effects of all benzodiazepines, including clorazepate dipotassium. In general, elderly or debilitated patients should be started on lower doses of clorazepate dipotassium tablets and observed closely, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Dose adjustments should also be made slowly, and with more caution in this patient population (see<span class="Bold"><a href="#PRECAUTIONS"> PRECAUTIONS </a></span>and<span class="Bold"><a href="#DA"> DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>)</span>.</p>

<h1>DRUG INTERACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">If clorazepate dipotassium is to be combined with other drugs acting on the central nervous system, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents to be employed. Animal experience indicates that clorazepate dipotassium prolongs the sleeping time after hexobarbital or after ethyl alcohol, increases the inhibitory effects of chlorpromazine, but does not exhibit monoamine oxidase inhibition. Clinical studies have shown increased sedation with concurrent hypnotic medications. The actions of the benzodiazepines may be potentiated by barbiturates, narcotics, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase inhibitors or other antidepressants.</p>
<p>If clorazepate dipotassium tablets are used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> associated with somatic disease states, careful attention must be paid to possible drug interaction with concomitant medication.</p>
<p>In bioavailability studies with normal subjects, the concurrent administration of antacids at therapeutic levels did not significantly influence the bioavailability of clorazepate dipotassium tablets.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Overdosage is usually manifested by varying degrees of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span> ranging from slight sedation to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>. As in the management of overdosage with any drug, it should be borne in mind that multiple agents may have been taken.</p>
<p>The treatment of overdosage should consist of the general measures employed in the management of overdosage of any CNS depressant. Gastric evacuation either by the induction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span>, lavage, or both, should be performed immediately. General supportive care, including frequent monitoring of the vital signs and close observation of the patient, is indicated. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span>, though rarely reported, may occur with large <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span>. In such cases the use of agents such as norepinephrine bitartrate injection, USP or metaraminol bitartrate injection, USP should be considered.</p>
<p>While reports indicate that individuals have survived <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> of clorazepate dipotassium as high as 450 to 675 mg, these doses are not necessarily an accurate indication of the amount of drug absorbed since the time interval between ingestion and the institution of treatment was not always known. Sedation in varying degrees was the most common physiological manifestation of clorazepate dipotassium overdosage. Deep <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span> when it occurred was usually associated with the ingestion of other drugs in addition to clorazepate dipotassium.</p>
<p>Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, is indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines and may be used in situations when an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> with a benzodiazepine is known or suspected. Prior to the administration of flumazenil, necessary measures should be instituted to secure airway, ventilation, and intravenous access. Flumazenil is intended as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, proper management of benzodiazepine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. Patients treated with flumazenil should be monitored for resedation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, and other residual benzodiazepine effects for an appropriate period after treatment.<span class="Bold"> The prescriber should be aware of a risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> in association with flumazenil treatment, particularly in long-term benzodiazepine users and in cyclic antidepressant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. </span>The complete flumazenil package insert including CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS should be consulted prior to use.</p>

<h1>ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Studies in rats and monkeys have shown a substantial difference between doses producing tranquilizing, sedative and toxic effects. In rats, conditioned avoidance response was inhibited at an oral dose of 10 mg/kg; sedation was induced at 32 mg/kg; the LD<span class="Sub">50</span> was 1320 mg/kg. In monkeys <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021344" conceptname="Abusive behavior">aggressive behavior</span> was reduced at an oral dose of 0.25 mg/kg; sedation (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437584" conceptname="Ataxia">ataxia</span>) was induced at 7.5 mg/kg; the LD<span class="Sub">50</span> could not be determined because of the emetic effect of large doses, but the LD<span class="Sub">50</span> exceeds 1600 mg/kg.</p>
<p>Twenty-four dogs were given clorazepate dipotassium orally in a 22-month toxicity study; doses up to 75 mg/kg were given. Drug-related changes occurred in the liver; weight was increased and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4143915" conceptname="Cholestasis">cholestasis</span> with minimal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">hepatocellular damage</span> was found, but lobular architecture remained well preserved.</p>
<p>Eighteen rhesus monkeys were given oral doses of clorazepate dipotassium from 3 to 36 mg/kg daily for 52 weeks. All treated animals remained similar to control animals. Although total leucocyte count remained within normal limits it tended to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> in the female animals on the highest doses.</p>
<p>Examination of all organs revealed no alterations attributable to clorazepate dipotassium. There was no damage to liver function or structure.</p>

<h2>Reproduction Studies</h2>
<p class="First">Standard fertility, reproduction, and teratology studies were conducted in rats and rabbits. Oral doses in rats up to 150 mg/kg and in rabbits up to 15 mg/kg produced no abnormalities in the fetuses. Clorazepate dipotassium did not alter the fertility indices or reproductive capacity of adult animals. As expected, the sedative effect of high doses interfered with care of the young by their mothers (see<span class="Bold"><a href="#uip"> Usage in Pregnancy</a></span>).</p>
