<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Minoxidil tablets contain minoxidil, an antihypertensive peripheral vasodilator. Minoxidil occurs as a white to off-white, crystalline powder, soluble in alcohol and propylene glycol; sparingly soluble in methanol; slightly soluble in water; practically insoluble in chloroform, acetone and ethyl acetate. The chemical name for minoxidil is 2,4-Pyrimidinediamine, 6-(1-piperidinyl)-, 3-oxide. The structural formula is represented below:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="Chemical Structure" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=02d7399f-94cc-f718-f214-587301edd138&amp;name=minoxidil-01.jpg"></div>
<p>Minoxidil tablets for oral administration contain either 2.5 mg or 10 mg of minoxidil. Inactive ingredients: anhydrous lactose, colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, and sodium starch glycolate.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-3.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>1. General Pharmacologic Properties</h2>
<p class="First">Minoxidil is an orally effective direct acting peripheral vasodilator that reduces elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure by decreasing peripheral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span>. Microcirculatory blood flow in animals is enhanced or maintained in all systemic vascular beds. In man, forearm and renal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span> decline; forearm blood flow increases while renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate are preserved.</p>
<p>Because it causes peripheral vasodilation, minoxidil elicits a number of predictable reactions. Reduction of peripheral arteriolar resistance and the associated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314171" conceptname="Low blood pressure reading">fall in blood pressure</span> trigger sympathetic, vagal inhibitory, and renal homeostatic mechanisms, including an increase in renin secretion, that lead to increased cardiac rate and output and salt and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4125002" conceptname="Idiopathic fluid retention">water retention</span>. These adverse effects can usually be minimized by concomitant administration of a diuretic and a beta-adrenergic blocking agent or other sympathetic nervous system suppressant.</p>
<p>Minoxidil does not interfere with vasomotor reflexes and therefore does not produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span>. The drug does not enter the central nervous system in experimental animals in significant amounts, and it does not affect CNS function in man.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-3.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>2. Effects on Blood Pressure and Target Organs</h2>
<p class="First">The extent and time-course of blood pressure reduction by minoxidil do not correspond closely to its concentration in plasma. After an effective single oral dose, blood pressure usually starts to decline within one-half hour, reaches a minimum between 2 and 3 hours and recovers at an arithmetically linear rate of about 30%/day. The total duration of effect is approximately 75 hours. When minoxidil is administered chronically, once or twice a day, the time required to achieve maximum effect on blood pressure with a given daily dose is inversely related to the size of the dose. Thus, maximum effect is achieved on 10 mg/day within 7 days, on 20 mg/day within 5 days, and on 40 mg/day within 3 days.</p>
<p>The blood pressure response to minoxidil is linearly related to the logarithm of the dose administered. The slope of this log-linear dose-response relationship is proportional to the extent of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> and approaches zero at a supine diastolic blood pressure of approximately 85 mm Hg.</p>
<p>When used in severely hypertensive patients resistant to other therapy, frequently with an accompanying diuretic and beta-blocker, minoxidil tablets usually decreased the blood pressure and reversed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372887" conceptname="Disorder of brain">encephalopathy</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="376103" conceptname="Retinopathy">retinopathy</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-3.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>3. Absorption and Metabolism</h2>
<p class="First">Minoxidil is at least 90% absorbed from the Gl tract in experimental animals and man. Plasma levels of the parent drug reach maximum within the first hour and decline rapidly thereafter. The average plasma half-life in man is 4.2 hours. Approximately 90% of the administered drug is metabolized, predominantly by conjugation with glucuronic acid at the N-oxide position in the pyrimidine ring, but also by conversion to more polar products. Known metabolites exert much less pharmacologic effect than minoxidil itself; all are excreted principally in the urine. Minoxidil does not bind to plasma proteins, and its renal clearance corresponds to the glomerular filtration rate. In the absence of functional renal tissue, minoxidil and its metabolites can be removed by hemodialysis.</p>

<h2>4. Cardiac Lesions in Animals</h2>
<p class="First">Minoxidil produces several cardiac lesions in animals. Some are characteristic of agents that cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span> and diastolic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> (beta-agonists like isoproterenol, arterial dilators like hydralazine) while others are produced by a narrower range of agents with arterial dilating properties. The significance of these lesions for humans is not clear, as they have not been recognized in patients treated with oral minoxidil at systemically active doses, despite formal review of over 150 autopsies of treated patients.</p>

<span class="Italics">Papillary muscle/subendocardial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280654" conceptname="Necrosis">necrosis</span></span><br>The most characteristic lesion of minoxidil, seen in rat, dog, and minipig (but not monkeys) is focal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280654" conceptname="Necrosis">necrosis</span> of the papillary muscle and subendocardial areas of the left ventricle. These lesions appear rapidly, within a few days of treatment with doses of 0.5 to 10 mg/kg/day in the dog and minipig, and are not progressive, although they leave residual <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4050007" conceptname="Scar">scars</span>. They are similar to lesions produced by other peripheral arterial dilators, by theobromine, and by beta-adrenergic receptor agonists such as isoproterenol, epinephrine, and albuterol. The lesions are thought to reflect <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4200991" conceptname="Ischemia">ischemia</span> provoked by increased oxygen demand (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span>) and relative decrease in coronary flow (decreased diastolic pressure and decreased time in diastole) caused by the vasodilatory effects of these agents coupled with reflex or directly induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>.</dd>
<dt class="Italics">(b)</dt>
<dd>
<span class="Italics">Hemorrhagic lesions</span><br>After acute oral minoxidil treatment (0.5 to 10 mg/kg/day) in dogs and minipigs, hemorrhagic lesions are seen in many parts of the heart, mainly in the epicardium, endocardium, and walls of small coronary arteries and arterioles. In minipigs the lesions occur primarily in the left atrium while in dogs they are most prominent in the right atrium, frequently appearing as grossly visible hemorrhagic lesions. With exposure of 1–20 mg/kg/day in the dog for 30 days or longer, there is replacement of myocardial cells by proliferating fibroblasts and angioblasts, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">hemorrhage</span> and hemosiderin accumulation. These lesions can be produced by topical minoxidil administration that gives systemic absorption of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day. Other peripheral dilators, including an experimental agent, nicorandil, and theobromine, have produced similar lesions.</dd>
<dt class="Italics">(c)</dt>
<dd>
<span class="Italics">Epicarditis</span><br>A less fully studied lesion is focal epicarditis, seen in dogs after 2 days of oral minoxidil. More recently, chronic proliferative epicarditis was observed in dogs treated topically twice a day for 90 days. In a one year oral dog study, serosanguinous pericardial fluid was seen.</dd>

<p>Autopsies of over 150 patients who died of various causes after receiving minoxidil for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> have not revealed the characteristic hemorrhagic (especially atrial) lesions seen in dogs and minipigs. While areas of papillary muscle and subendocardial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280654" conceptname="Necrosis">necrosis</span> were occasionally seen, they occurred in the presence of known pre-existing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317576" conceptname="Coronary arteriosclerosis">coronary artery disease</span> and were also seen in patients never exposed to minoxidil in another series using similar, but not identical, autopsy methods.</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Because of the potential for serious adverse effects, minoxidil tablets are indicated only in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> that is symptomatic or associated with target organ damage and is not manageable with maximum therapeutic doses of a diuretic plus two other antihypertensive drugs. At the present time use in milder degrees of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> is not recommended because the benefit-risk relationship in such patients has not been defined.</p>
<p>Minoxidil reduced supine diastolic blood pressure by 20 mm Hg or to 90 mm Hg or less in approximately 75% of patients, most of who had <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> that could not be controlled by other drugs.</p>

<h2>2. Concomitant Treatment to Prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">Tachycardia</span> is Usually Required</h2>
<p class="First">Minoxidil increases the heart rate. Angina may worsen or appear for the first time during minoxidil treatment, probably because of the increased oxygen demands associated with increased heart rate and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span>. The increase in rate and the occurrence of angina generally can be prevented by the concomitant administration of a beta-adrenergic blocking drug or other sympathetic nervous system suppressant. The ability of beta-adrenergic blocking agents to minimize papillary muscle lesions in animals is further reason to utilize such an agent concomitantly. Round-the-clock effectiveness of the sympathetic suppressant should be ensured.</p>

Patients should be observed closely for any suggestion of a pericardial disorder, and echocardiographic studies should be carried out if suspicion arises. More vigorous diuretic therapy, dialysis, pericardiocentesis, or surgery may be required. If the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4215818" conceptname="Effusion">effusion</span> persists, withdrawal of minoxidil should be considered in light of other means of controlling the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> and the patient's clinical status.</p>

<p class="First">Two-year carcinogenicity studies of minoxidil have been conducted by the dermal and oral (dietary) routes of administration in mice and rats. There were no positive findings with the oral (dietary) route of administration in rats.</p>
<p>In the two-year dermal study in mice, an increased incidence of mammary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> and adenocarcinomas in the females at all dose levels (8, 25 and 80 mg/kg/day) was attributed to increased prolactin activity. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030186" conceptname="Hyperprolactinemia">Hyperprolactinemia</span> is a well-known mechanism in the enhancement of mouse mammary tumors, but has not been associated with mammary tumorigenesis in women. Additionally, topical minoxidil has not been shown to cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030186" conceptname="Hyperprolactinemia">hyperprolactinemia</span> in women on clinical trials. Absorption of minoxidil through rodent skin is greater than would be experienced by patients treated topically with minoxidil for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133280" conceptname="Alopecia">hair loss</span>. Dietary administration of minoxidil to mice for up to 2 years was associated with an increased incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">malignant lymphomas</span> in females at all dose levels (10, 25 and 63 mg/kg/day) and an increased incidence of hepatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4101098" conceptname="Nodule">nodules</span> in males (63 mg/kg/day). There was no effect of dietary minoxidil on the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201519" conceptname="Primary malignant neoplasm of liver">malignant liver tumors</span>.</p>
<p>In the two-year dermal study in rats there were significant increases in incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118993" conceptname="Pheochromocytoma">pheochromocytomas</span> in males and females and preputial gland <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> in males. Changes in incidence of neoplasms found to be increased in the dermal or oral carcinogenicity studies were typical of those expected in rodents treated with other hypotensive agents (adrenal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118993" conceptname="Pheochromocytoma">pheochromocytomas</span> in rats), treatment-related hormonal alterations (mammary carcinomas in female mice; preputial gland <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> in male rats) or representative of normal variations within the range of historical incidence for rodent neoplasms (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">malignant lymphomas</span>, liver <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4101098" conceptname="Nodule">nodules</span>/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> in mice). Based on differences in absorption of minoxidil and mechanisms of tumorigenesis in these rodent species, none of these changes were considered to be relevant to the safety of patients treated topically with minoxidil for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133280" conceptname="Alopecia">hair loss</span>.</p>
<p>There was no evidence of epithelial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4296894" conceptname="Hyperplasia">hyperplasia</span> or tumorigenesis at the sites of topical application of minoxidil in either species in the two-year dermal carcinogenesis studies. No evidence of carcinogenicity was detected in rats or rabbits treated topically with minoxidil for one year. Topical minoxidil (2% and 5%) did not significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reduce the latency period of UV light-initiated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135777" conceptname="Neoplasm of uncertain behavior of skin">skin tumors</span> in hairless mice, as compared to controls, in a 12-month photocarcinogenicity study.</p>
<p>Minoxidil was not mutagenic in the <span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span></span> (Ames) test, the DNA damage alkaline elution assay, the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay, the rat bone marrow micronucleus assay, or the mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay. An equivocal result was recorded in an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> cytogenetic assay using Chinese hamster cells at long exposure times, but a similar assay using human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span> was negative.</p>
<p>In a study in which male and female rats received one or five times the maximum recommended human oral antihypertensive dose of minoxidil (multiples based on a 50 kg patient) there was a dose-dependent reduction in conception rate.</p>

<p>Pregnancy Category C. Oral administration of minoxidil has been associated with evidence of increased fetal resorption in rabbits, but not rats, when administered at five times the maximum recommended oral antihypertensive human dose. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits. Subcutaneous administration of minoxidil to pregnant rats at 80 mg/kg/day was maternally toxic but not teratogenic. Higher subcutaneous doses produced evidence of development toxicity. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Minoxidil should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<h2>10. Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of minoxidil tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified the differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>

<h2>11. Unapproved Use</h2>
<p class="First">Use of minoxidil tablets, in any formulation, to promote hair growth is not an approved indication. While clinical trials with minoxidil topical solution 2% demonstrated that formulation and dosage were safe and effective, the effects of extemporaneous formulations and dosages have not been shown to be safe or effective. Because systemic absorption of topically applied drug may occur and is dependent on vehicle and/or method of use, extemporaneous topical formulations made from minoxidil should be considered to share in the full range of <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS,</span> and <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span> listed in this insert.

This develops within 3 to 6 weeks after starting therapy. It is usually first noticed on the temples, between the eyebrows, between the hairline and the eyebrows, or in the side-burn area of the upper lateral cheek, later extending to the back, arms, legs, and scalp. Upon discontinuation of minoxidil, new hair growth stops, but 1 to 6 months may be required for restoration to pretreatment appearance.

These changes usually disappear with continuance of treatment and revert to the pretreatment state if minoxidil is discontinued. No symptoms have been associated with these changes, nor have there been alterations in blood cell counts or in plasma enzyme concentrations that would suggest myocardial damage. Long-term treatment of patients manifesting such changes has provided no evidence of deteriorating cardiac function.

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">There have been only a few instances of deliberate or accidental overdosage with minoxidil tablets. One patient recovered after taking 50 mg of minoxidil together with 500 mg of a barbiturate. When exaggerated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> is encountered, it is most likely to occur in association with residual sympathetic nervous system blockade from previous therapy (guanethidine-like effects or alpha-adrenergic blockage), which prevents the usual compensatory maintenance of blood pressure. Intravenous administration of normal saline will help to maintain blood pressure and facilitate urine formation in these patients. Sympathomimetic drugs such as norepinephrine or epinephrine should be avoided because of their excessive cardiac stimulating action. Phenylephrine, angiotensin II, vasopressin, and dopamine all reverse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> due to minoxidil, but should only be used if underperfusion of a vital organ is evident.</p>
<p>Radioimmunoassay can be performed to determine the concentration of minoxidil in the blood. At the maximum adult dose of 100 mg/day, peak blood levels of 1641 ng/mL and 2441 ng/mL were observed in two patients, respectively. Due to patient-to-patient variation in blood levels, it is difficult to establish an overdosage warning level. In general, a substantial increase above 2000 ng/mL should be regarded as overdosage, unless the physician is aware that the patient has taken no more than the maximum dose.</p>
<p>Oral LD<span class="Sub">50</span> in rats has ranged from 1321–3492 mg/kg; in mice, 2456–2648 mg/kg.</p>

<a name="section-10.1"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Patients over 12 years of age:</span> The recommended initial dosage of minoxidil tablets is 5 mg of minoxidil given as a single daily dose. Daily dosage can be increased to 10, 20 and then to 40 mg in single or divided doses if required for optimum blood pressure control. The effective dosage range is usually 10 to 40 mg per day. The maximum recommended dosage is 100 mg per day.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-10.2"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Patients under 12 years of age:</span> The initial dosage is 0.2 mg/kg minoxidil as a single daily dose. The dosage may be increased in 50 to 100% increments until optimum blood pressure control is achieved. The effective dosage range is usually 0.25 mg to 1 mg/kg/day. The maximum recommended dosage is 50 mg daily (<span class="Bold">see <a href="#PrePediatric">9. Pediatric Use</a></span> under <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>).</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-10.3"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dose frequency:</span> The magnitude of within-day fluctuation of arterial pressure during therapy with minoxidil is directly proportional to the extent of pressure reduction. If supine diastolic pressure has been reduced less than 30 mm Hg, the drug need be administered only once a day; if supine diastolic pressure has been reduced more than 30 mm Hg, the daily dosage should be divided into two equal parts.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-10.4"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Frequency of dosage adjustment:</span> Dosage must be titrated carefully according to individual response. Intervals between dosage adjustments normally should be at least 3 days since the full response to a given dose is not obtained for at least that amount of time. <span class="Bold">Where a more rapid management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> is required, dose adjustments can be made every 6 hours if the patient is carefully monitored.</span></p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-10.6"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Diuretics:</span> Minoxidil must be used in conjunction with a diuretic in patients relying on renal function for maintaining salt and water balance. Diuretics have been used at the following dosages when starting therapy with minoxidil: hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg, b.i.d.) or other thiazides at equieffective dosage; chlorthalidone (50 to 100 mg, once daily); furosemide (40 mg, b.i.d.). If excessive salt and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4125002" conceptname="Idiopathic fluid retention">water retention</span> results in a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span> of more than 5 pounds, diuretic therapy should be changed to furosemide; if the patient is already taking furosemide, dosage should be increased in accordance with the patient's requirements.</p>
</div>

<a name="section-10.7"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Beta-blocker or other sympathetic nervous system suppressants:</span> When therapy with minoxidil is begun, the dosage of a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drug should be the equivalent of 80 to 160 mg of propranolol per day in divided doses.</p>
<p>If beta-blockers are contraindicated, methyldopa (250 to 750 mg, b.i.d.) may be used instead. Methyldopa must be given for at least 24 hours before starting therapy with minoxidil because of the delay in the onset of methyldopa's action. Limited clinical experience indicates that clonidine may also be used to prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span> induced by minoxidil; the usual dosage is 0.1 to 0.2 mg twice daily.</p>
<p>Sympathetic nervous system suppressants may not completely prevent an increase in heart rate due to minoxidil but usually do prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>. Typically, patients receiving a beta-blocker prior to initiation of therapy with minoxidil have a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span> and can be expected to have an increase in heart rate toward normal when minoxidil is added. When treatment with minoxidil and beta-blocker or other sympathetic nervous system suppressant are begun simultaneously, their opposing cardiac effects usually nullify each other, leading to little change in heart rate.</p>

<h1>PATIENT INFORMATION</h1>
<p class="First">Minoxidil tablets contain minoxidil, a medicine for the treatment of high blood pressure in the patient who has not been controlled or is experiencing unacceptable side effects with other medications. It must usually be taken with other medicines.</p>
<p>Be absolutely sure to take all of your medicines for high blood pressure according to your doctor's instructions. Do not stop taking minoxidil unless your doctor tells you to. Do not give any of your medicine to other people.</p>
<p>It is important that you look for the warning signals of certain undesired effects of minoxidil. Call your doctor if they occur. Your doctor will need to see you regularly while you are taking minoxidil. Be sure to keep all your appointments or to arrange for new ones if you must miss one.</p>
<p>Do not hesitate to call your doctor if any <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090431" conceptname="Discomfort">discomforts</span> or problems occur.</p>
<p>The information here is intended to help you take minoxidil properly. It does not tell you all there is to know about minoxidil. There is a more technical leaflet that you may request from the pharmacist; you may need your doctor's help in understanding parts of that leaflet.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What is Minoxidil?</span></p>
<p>Minoxidil tablets contain minoxidil which is a drug for lowering the blood pressure. It works by relaxing and enlarging certain small blood vessels so that blood flows through them more easily.</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="Figure" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=02d7399f-94cc-f718-f214-587301edd138&amp;name=minoxidil-06.jpg"></div>
<p><span class="Bold">Why lower blood pressure?</span></p>
<p>Your doctor has prescribed minoxidil to lower your blood pressure and protect vital parts of your body. Uncontrolled blood pressure can cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377551" conceptname="Blind hypertensive eye">blindness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">kidney failure</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">heart attacks</span>.</p>

<p>Most people with high blood pressure need to take medicines to treat it for their whole lives.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Who should take minoxidil tablets?</span></p>
<p>There are many people with high blood pressure, but most of them do not need minoxidil. Minoxidil is used ONLY when your doctor decides that:</p>
<ol>
<li>your high blood pressure is severe;</li>
<li>your high blood pressure is causing symptoms or damage to vital organs; and</li>
<li>other medicines did not work well enough or had very disturbing side effects.</li>

<p>Minoxidil should be taken only when a doctor prescribes it. Never give any of your minoxidil tablets, or any other high blood pressure medicine, to a friend or relative.</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="Figure" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=02d7399f-94cc-f718-f214-587301edd138&amp;name=minoxidil-08.jpg"></div>
<p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy:</span> In some cases doctors may prescribe minoxidil for women who are pregnant or who are planning to have children. However, its safe use in pregnancy has not been established. Laboratory animals had a reduced ability to become pregnant and a reduced survival of offspring while taking minoxidil. If you are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant, be sure to tell your doctor.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">How to take minoxidil tablets.</span></p>
<p>Usually, your doctor will prescribe two other medicines along with minoxidil. These will help lower blood pressure and will help prevent undesired effects of minoxidil.</p>
<p>Often, when a medicine like minoxidil lowers blood pressure, your body tries to return the blood pressure to the original higher level. It does this by holding on to water and salt (so there will be more fluid to pump) and by making your heart beat faster. To prevent this, your doctor will usually prescribe a water tablet to remove the extra salt and water from your body (a diuretic: dye-u-RET-tic) and another medicine to slow your heart beat.</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="Figure" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=02d7399f-94cc-f718-f214-587301edd138&amp;name=minoxidil-09.jpg"></div>
<p><span class="Bold">You must follow your doctor's instructions exactly, taking all the prescribed medicines, in the right amounts, each day.</span> These medicines will help keep your blood pressure down. The water tablet and heart beat medicine will help prevent the undesired effects of minoxidil.</p>
<p>Minoxidil tablets come in two strengths (2.5 milligrams and 10 milligrams) that are marked on each tablet. Pay close attention to the tablet markings to be sure you are taking the correct strength. Your doctor may prescribe half a tablet; the tablets are scored (partly cut on one side) so that you can easily break them.</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="Figure" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=02d7399f-94cc-f718-f214-587301edd138&amp;name=minoxidil-10.jpg"></div>
<p>When you first start taking minoxidil, your doctor may need to see you often in order to adjust your dosage. Take all your medicine according to the schedule prescribed by your doctor. <span class="Bold">Do not skip any doses. If you should forget a dose of minoxidil, wait until it is time for your next dose, then continue with your regular schedule. Remember: do not stop taking minoxidil, or any of your other high blood pressure medicines, without checking with your doctor.</span> Make sure that any doctor treating or examining you knows that you are taking high blood pressure medicines, including minoxidil.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">WARNING SIGNALS</span></p>
<p>Even if you take all your medicines correctly, minoxidil tablets may cause undesired effects. Some of these are serious and you should be on the lookout for them. <span class="Bold">If any of the following warning signals occur, you must call your doctor immediately:</span></p>

<p><span class="Bold">Hair growth:</span> About 8 out of every 10 patients who have taken minoxidil noticed that fine <span class="Bold">body hair grew darker or longer</span> on certain parts of the body. This happened about 3 to 6 weeks after beginning treatment. The hair may first be noticed on the forehead and temples, between the eyebrows, or on the upper part of the cheeks. Later, hair may grow on the back, arms, legs, or scalp. Although hair growth may not be noticeable to some patients, it often is bothersome in women and children. <span class="Bold">Unwanted hair can be controlled with a hair remover or by shaving.</span> The extra hair is not permanent, it disappears within 1 to 6 months of stopping minoxidil. <span class="Bold">Nevertheless, you should not stop taking minoxidil without first talking to your doctor.</span></p>
