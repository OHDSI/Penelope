<h1><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION</span></h1>
<p class="First">Phenytoin sodium, USP is an antiepileptic drug. Phenytoin sodium, USP is related to the barbiturates in chemical structure, but has a five-membered ring. The chemical name is sodium 5,5-diphenyl-2,4-imidazolidinedione, having the following structural formula:</p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â </p>
<p>Each extended phenytoin sodium capsule, USP contains 100 mg phenytoin sodium, USP. Each capsule also contains the following inactive ingredients: D&amp;C Red #28, D&amp;C Red #33, FD&amp;C Blue #1, gelatin, hydroxypropyl cellulose, mannitol, magnesium stearate, talc and titanium dioxide. Product <span class="Italics">in vivo</span>Â performance is characterized by a slow and extended rate of absorption with peak blood concentrations expected in 4 to 12 hours as contrasted to <span class="Italics">Prompt Phenytoin Sodium Capsules, </span>USP with a rapid rate of absorption with peak blood concentration expected in 1Â½ to 3 hours.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></h2>
<p class="First">Phenytoin is an antiepileptic drug which can be useful in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>. The primary site of action appears to be the <span class="Italics">motor cortex </span>where spread of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> activity is inhibited. Possibly by promoting sodium efflux from neurons, phenytoin tends to <span class="Italics">stabilize </span>the threshold against <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">hyperexcitability</span> caused by excessive stimulation or environmental changes capable of reducing membrane sodium gradient. This includes the reduction of post tetanic potentiation at synapses. Loss of post tetanic potentiation prevents cortical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> foci from detonating adjacent cortical areas. Phenytoin reduces the maximal activity of brain stem centers responsible for the tonic phase of tonic-clonic (grandmal) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>.</p>

<span class="Bold">Phar</span><span class="Bold">macokinetics and Drug Metabolis</span><span class="Bold">m</span>
</h2>
<p class="First">The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day.</p>
<p>When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance and are obtained just prior to the patientâ€™s next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individualâ€™s threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. For extended phenytoin sodium capsules, peak serum levels occur 4 to 12 hours after administration.</p>
<p>Optimum control without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum levels between 10 and 20 mcg/mL, although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="374924" conceptname="Generalized convulsive epilepsy">grand mal</span>) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin.</p>
<p>In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result fromÂ liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin plasma levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal.</p>
<p>Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but more important by tubular secretion. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high plasma levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. </p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Special Populations</span></h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Patients with Renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic Disease</span>: </span>Due to an increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span>, or in those with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4001047" conceptname="Hypoalbuminemia">hypoalbuminemia</span>, the interpretation of total phenytoinÂ plasma concentrations should be made with caution (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#_DOSAGE_AND_ADMINISTRATION">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>
<p>Unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more useful in these patient populations.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Age: </span>Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Phenytoin dosing requirements are highly variable and must be individualized (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#_DOSAGE_AND_ADMINISTRATION">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Gender and Race: </span>Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Pediatrics: </span>Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dose (300 mg/day).</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Effects of Abrupt Withdrawal</span></h2>
<p class="First">Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span>. When, in the judgement of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative antiepileptic medication arises, this should be done gradually. In the event of an allergic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reaction</span>, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an antiepileptic drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. </p>

<h2><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322252" conceptname="Suicidal behavior">Suicidal Behavior</span> and Ideation</span></h2>
<p class="First">Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including extended phenytoin sodium, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, suicidal thoughts or behavior and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</p>
<p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322252" conceptname="Suicidal behavior">suicidal behavior</span> or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>.</p>
<p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. </p>
<p>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed.</p>
<p>The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.</p>
<p>Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</p>

<p>The relative risk for suicidal thought or behavior was higher in clinical trials for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> and psychiatric indications. </p>
<p>Anyone considering prescribing extended phenytoin sodium or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">Epilepsy</span> and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. </p>
<p>Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm.

The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Extended phenytoin sodium should be discontinued at the first sign of a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>, unless the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of Drug Reaction with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302954" conceptname="Disorder characterized by eosinophilia">Eosinophilia</span> and Systemic Symptoms (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#_Drug_Reaction_with">DRESS/Multiorgan <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span></a></span><span class="Bold">Â </span>below).</p>
<p>Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. Consideration should be given to avoiding phenytoin as an alternative for carbamazepine in patients positive for HLA-B*1502.</p>
<p>The use of HLA-B*1502 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied.</p>

<h2>
<span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span><span class="Bold">:</span>
</h2>
<p class="First">Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement.</p>
<p>Phenytoin is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">drug toxicity</span>. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Serum level determinations for phenytoin are especially helpful when possible drug interactions are suspected.</p>
<p>The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below:</p>
<p>Note: The list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Drugs that affect phenytoin concentrations:</span></p>
<ul class="Disc">
<li>Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, antiepilepticÂ agents (ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate), azolesÂ (fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), capecitabine, chloramphenicol,Â chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, disulfiram, estrogens, fluorouracil, fluoxetine, fluvastatin,Â fluvoxamine, H -antagonists (e.g. cimetidine), halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, omeprazole,Â phenothiazines, salicylates, sertraline, succinimides, sulfonamides (e.g., sulfamethizole,Â sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim), ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodoneÂ and warfarin.<br>
</li>
<li>Drugs that may decrease phenytoin levels, include: anti-cancer drugs usually in combination (e.g.,Â bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate) carbamazepine, chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433753" conceptname="Alcohol abuse">alcohol abuse</span>,Â folic acid, fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, reserpine, ritonavir, St. Johnâ€™s Wort, sucralfate and vigabatrin.<br>
</li>
<li>Administration of phenytoin with preparations that increase gastric pH (e.g., supplements or antacidsÂ containing calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide) may affect theÂ absorption of phenytoin. In most cases where interactions were seen, the effect is a decrease inÂ phenytoin levels when the drugs are taken at the same time. When possible, phenytoin and theseÂ 2Â products should not be taken at the same time of day.<br>
</li>
<li>Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels, include: phenobarbital, sodiumÂ valproate and valproic acid. Similarly, the effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid andÂ sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable.<br>
</li>
<li>The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require anÂ adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Italics">Drugs affected by phenytoin:</span></p>
<ul class="Disc">
<li>Drugs that should not be coadministered with phenytoin: Delavirdine (seeÂ CONTRAINDICATIONS).<br>

<li>Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin include: azoles (fluconazole, ketoconazole,itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole), corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide,Â irinotecan, oral contraceptives, paclitaxel, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, teniposide,Â theophylline and vitamin D.<br>
</li>
<li>Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministeredÂ with warfarin.<br>
</li>
<li>Phenytoin decreases plasma concentrations of active metabolites of albendazole, certain HIVÂ antivirals (efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir), anti-epilepticÂ agents (felbamate, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, quetiapine) atorvastatin, cyclosporine, digoxin,Â fluvastatin, folic acid, mexiletine, nisoldipine, praziquantel and simvastatin.<br>
</li>
<li>Phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, theÂ active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir mayÂ increase the concentration of amprenavir.<br>
</li>
<li>Resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockingÂ agents pancuronium, vecuronium, rocuronium and cisatracurium has occurred in patients chronicallyÂ administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizingÂ agents is unknown.

<h2><span class="Bold">Treatment:</span></h2>
<p class="First">Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. </p>
<p>The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> in pediatric patients.</p>
<p>In acute over dosage, the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind.</p>

<a name="_DOSAGE_AND_ADMINISTRATION"></a><a name="section-10"></a><p></p>
<h1><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span></h1>
<p class="First">Serum concentrations should be monitored in changing from extendedÂ phenytoin sodium capsules, USPÂ to Prompt Phenytoin Sodium Capsules, USP, and from the sodium salt to the free acid form.</p>
<p>Extended phenytoin sodium capsules, USP are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34072-9">
<a name="section-10.1"></a><p></p>
<h2><span class="Bold">General:</span></h2>
<p class="First">Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustmentsâ€”the clinically effective serum level is usually 10 to 20 mcg/mL. With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days.Â </p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">

<h2>
<span class="Bold">Adult Dos</span><span class="Bold">age:</span>
</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Divided daily dos</span><span class="Bold">age:</span></p>
<p>Patients who have received no previous treatment may be started on one 100-mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule, USP three times daily and the dosage then adjusted to suit individual requirements. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be one capsule three to four times a day. An increase up to two capsules three times a day may be made, if necessary.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Once-a-day dos</span><span class="Bold">age:</span></p>
<p>In adults, if <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> control is established with divided doses of three 100-mg extended phenytoinÂ sodium capsules, USP daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg of extended phenytoin sodium capsules, USP may be considered. Studies comparing divided doses of 300 mg with a single daily dose of this quantity indicated absorption, peak plasma levels, biologic half-life, difference between peak and minimum values, and urinary recovery were equivalent. Once-a-day dosage offers a convenience to the individual patient or to nursing personnel for institutionalized patients and is intended to be used only for patients requiring this amount of drug daily. A major problem in motivating noncompliant patients may also be lessened when the patient can take this drug once a day. However, patients should be cautioned not to miss a dose, inadvertently.</p>
<p>Only extended phenytoin sodium capsules, USP are recommended for once-a-day dosing. Inherent differences in dissolution characteristics and resultant absorption rates of phenytoin due to different manufacturing procedures and/or dosage forms preclude such recommendation for other phenytoin products. When a change in the dosage form or brand is prescribed, careful monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be carried out.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Loading dose: </span></p>
<p>Some authorities have advocated use of an oral loading dose of phenytoin in adults who require rapid steady-rate serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desirable. This dosing regimen should be reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting where phenytoin serum levels can be closely monitored. Patients with a history of renal or liver disease should not receive the oral loading regimen. </p>
<p>Initially, one gram of extended phenytoin sodium capsules, USP is divided into three doses (400mg, 300mg, 300mg) and administered at two-hour intervals. Normal maintenance dosage is then instituted 24 hours after the loading dose, with frequent serum level determinations. </p>
