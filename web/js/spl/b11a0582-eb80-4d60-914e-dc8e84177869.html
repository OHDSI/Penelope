<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>Chlordiazepoxide HCI has antianxiety, sedative, appetite-stimulating and weak analgesic actions. The precise mechanism of action is not known. The drug blocks EEG arousal from stimulation of the brain stem reticular formation. It takes several hours for peak blood levels to be reached and the half-life of the drug is between 24 and 48 hours. After the drug is discontinued plasma levels decline slowly over a period of several days. Chlordiazepoxide is excreted in the urine, with 1% to 2% unchanged and 3% to 6% as conjugate.<br><br><span class="Bold">Animal Pharmacology<br></span>The drug has been studied extensively in many species of animals and these studies are suggestive of action on the limbic system of the brain, which recent evidence indicates is involved in emotional responses.<br>Hostile monkeys were made tame by oral drug doses which did not cause sedation. Chlordiazepoxide HCl revealed atamingaction with the elimination of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029621" conceptname="Fear">fear</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021344" conceptname="Abusive behavior">aggression</span>. The taming effect of chlordiazepoxide was further demonstrated in rats made vicious by lesions in the septal area of the brain. The drug dosage which effectively blocked the vicious reaction was well below the dose which caused sedation in these animals.<br>The LD50 of parenterally administered chlordiazepoxide HCI was determined in mice (72 hours) and rats (5 days), and calculated according to the method of Miller and Tainter, with the following results: mice, IV, 123<br><br><span class="Bold">Effects on Reproduction<br></span>Reproduction studies in rats fed 10, 20, and 80 mg/kg daily and bred through one or two matings showed no congenital anomalies, nor were there adverse effects on lactation of the dams or growth of the newborn. However, in another study at 100 mg/kg daily there was noted a significant decrease in the fertilization rate and a marked decrease in the viability and body weight of off-spring which may be attributable to sedative activity, thus resulting in lack of interest in mating and lessened maternal nursing and care of the young. One neonate in each of the first and second matings in the rat reproduction study at the 100 mg/kg dose exhibited major skeletal defects. Further studies are in progress to determine the significance of these findings.<br><br>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>Chlordiazepoxide HCl may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. Similarly, it may impair mental alertness in children. The concomitant use of alcohol or other central nervous system depressants may have an additive effect. PATIENTS SHOULD BE WARNED ACCORDINGLY.<br><br><span class="Bold">Usage in Pregnancy<br>An increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of minor tranquilizers (chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and meprobamate)during the first trimester of pregnancy has been suggested in several studies. Because use of these drugs is rarely a matter of urgency, their use during this period should almost always be avoided. The possibility that a woman of childbearing potential may be pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. Patients should be advised that if they become pregnant during therapy or intend to become pregnant they should communicate with their physicians about the desirability of discontinuing the drug.</span><br>Withdrawal symptoms of the barbiturate type have occurred after the discontinuation of benzodiazepines. (See<span class="Underline">DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></span>section.)<br><br>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42232-9">
<a name="section-6"></a><p></p>
<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>In elderly and debilitated patients, it is recommended that the dosage be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude the development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437584" conceptname="Ataxia">ataxia</span> or oversedation (10 mg or less per day initially, to be increased gradually as needed and tolerated). In general, the concomitant administration of chlordiazepoxide HCI and other psychotropic agents is not recommended. If such combination therapy seems indicated, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents to be employedparticularly when the known potentiating compounds such as MAO inhibitors and phenothiazines are to be used. The usual precautions in treating patients with impaired renal or hepatic function should be observed.<br>Paradoxical reactions, e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">excitement</span>, stimulation and acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4327815" conceptname="Feeling angry">rage</span>, have been reported in psychiatric patients and in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">hyperactive</span> aggressive pediatric patients, and should be watched for during chlordiazepoxide therapy. The usual precautions are indicated when chlordiazepoxide HCI capsules are used in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety states</span> where there is any evidence of impending <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>; it should be borne in mind that suicidal tendencies may be present and protective measures may be necessary. Although clinical studies have not established a cause and effect relationship, physicians should be aware that variable effects on blood coagulation have been reported very rarely in patients receiving oral anticoagulants and chlordiazepoxide. In view of isolated reports associating chlordiazepoxide with exacerbation of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4305376" conceptname="Porphyria">porphyria</span>, caution should be exercised in prescribing chlordiazepoxide to patients suffering from this disease.<br><br>

<a name="section-7"></a><p></p>
<h1>PEDIATRIC USE</h1>Because of the varied response of pediatric patients to CNS-acting drugs, therapy should be initiated with the lowest dose and increased as required (see<span class="Underline">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>). Since clinical experience with chlordiazepoxide in pediatric patients under 6 years of age is limited, use in this age group is not recommended. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">Hyperactive</span> aggressive pediatric patients should be monitored for paradoxical reactions to chlordiazepoxide (see<span class="Underline">PRECAUTIONS</span>).<br><br>

<h1>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</h1>To assure the safe and effective use of benzodiazepines, patients should be informed that, since benzodiazepines may produce psychological and physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>, it is advisable that they consult with their physician before either increasing the dose or abruptly discontinuing the drug.<br><br>

<h1>DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></h1>Chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride capsules are classified by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a Schedule IV controlled substance.<br>Withdrawal symptoms, similar in character to those noted with barbiturates and alcohol (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span>, abdominal and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75635" conceptname="Cramp">muscle cramps</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span>), have occurred following abrupt discontinuance of chlordiazepoxide. The more severe withdrawal symptoms have usually been limited to those patients who had received excessive doses over an extended period of time. Generally milder withdrawal symptoms (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4148767" conceptname="Dysphoric mood">dysphoria</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>) have been reported following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines taken continuously at therapeutic levels for several months. Consequently, after extended therapy, abrupt discontinuation should generally be avoided and a gradual dosage tapering schedule followed. Addiction-prone individuals (such as drug addicts or alcoholics) should be under careful surveillance when receiving chlordiazepoxide or other psychotropic agents because of the predisposition of such patients to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4036424" conceptname="Drug tolerance">habituation</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>.<br><br>
