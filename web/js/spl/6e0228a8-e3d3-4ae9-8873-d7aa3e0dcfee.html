<h1>DESCRIPTION<span class="Italics"></span>
</h1>
<p class="First">Each tablet for oral administration contains 738 mg of tolmetin sodium, USP as the dihydrate in an amount equivalent to 600 mg of tolmetin. Each tablet contains 54 mg (2.35 mEq) of sodium and the following inactive ingredients: black iron oxide, crospovidone, hypromellose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polydextrose, polyethylene glycol, povidone, pregelatinized starch (corn), sodium lauryl sulfate, titanium dioxide, triacetin and yellow iron oxide.</p>
<p>The pKa of tolmetin is 3.5 and tolmetin sodium is freely soluble in water.</p>
<p>Tolmetin sodium is a nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent. The structural formula is:</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY </h1>
<p class="First">Studies in animals have shown tolmetin sodium to possess anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activity. In the rat, tolmetin prevents the development of experimentally induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4025831" conceptname="Arthritis mutilans">polyarthritis</span> and also decreases established <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span>.</p>
<p>The mode of action of tolmetin is not known. However, studies in laboratory animals and man have demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory action of tolmetin is <span class="Italics">not</span> due to pituitary-adrenal stimulation. Tolmetin inhibits prostaglandin synthetase <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and lowers the plasma level of prostaglandin E in man. This reduction in prostaglandin synthesis may be responsible for the anti-inflammatory action. Tolmetin does not appear to alter the course of the underlying disease in man.</p>
<p>In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> and in normal volunteers, tolmetin sodium is rapidly and almost completely absorbed with peak plasma levels being reached within 30 to 60 minutes after an oral therapeutic dose. In controlled studies, the time to reach peak tolmetin plasma concentration is approximately 20 minutes longer following administration of a 600 mg tablet, compared to an equivalent dose given as 200 mg tablets. The clinical meaningfulness of this finding, if any, is unknown. Tolmetin displays a biphasic elimination from the plasma consisting of a rapid phase with a half-life of 1 to 2 hours followed by a slower phase with a half-life of about 5 hours. Peak plasma levels of approximately 40 mcg/mL are obtained with a 400 mg oral dose. Essentially all of the administered dose is recovered in the urine in 24 hours either as an inactive oxidative metabolite or as conjugates of tolmetin. An 18-day multiple-dose study demonstrated no accumulation of tolmetin when compared with a single dose.</p>
<p>In two fecal blood loss studies of 4 to 6 days duration involving 15 subjects each, tolmetin did not induce an increase in blood loss over that observed during a 4-day drug free control period. In the same studies, aspirin produced a greater blood loss than occurred during the drug free control period, and a greater blood loss than occurred during the tolmetin sodium treatment period. In one of the two studies, indomethacin produced a greater fecal blood loss than occurred during the drug free control period; in the second study, indomethacin did not induce a significant increase in blood loss.</p>
<p>Tolmetin is effective in treating both the acute flares and in the long-term management of the symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80180" conceptname="Osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4253901" conceptname="Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis">juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</span>.</p>
<p>In patients with either <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80180" conceptname="Osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</span>, tolmetin is as effective as aspirin and indomethacin in controlling disease activity, but the frequency of the milder gastrointestinal adverse effects and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377575" conceptname="Tinnitus">tinnitus</span> was less than in aspirin-treated patients, and the incidence of central nervous system adverse effects was less than in indomethacin-treated patients.</p>
<p>In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4253901" conceptname="Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis">juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</span>, tolmetin is as effective as aspirin in controlling disease activity, with a similar incidence of adverse reactions. Mean <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4094657" conceptname="Aspartate aminotransferase">SGOT</span> values, initially elevated in patients on previous aspirin therapy, remained elevated in the aspirin group and decreased in the tolmetin group.</p>
<p>Tolmetin has produced additional therapeutic benefit when added to a regimen of gold salts and, to a lesser extent, with corticosteroids. Tolmetin should not be used in conjunction with salicylates since greater benefit from the combination is not likely, but the potential for adverse reactions is increased.</p>

<span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</span></span><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"></span></span>
</h3>
<p class="First">Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to 3 years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> (MI) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.</p>
<p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</p>
<p>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as tolmetin, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events (see <a href="#ID_f9eee01c-a115-49e6-bb70-bc176d076c94">WARNINGS</a>).</p>

<h4>Post-MI Patients </h4>
<p class="First">Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> in the first year <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">post MI</span> was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> in NSAID users persisted over at least the next 4 years of follow-up.</p>
<p>Avoid the use of tolmetin in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If tolmetin is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4124683" conceptname="Silent myocardial ischemia">cardiac ischemia</span>.</p>

<p class="First">NSAIDs, including tolmetin, can cause serious gastrointestinal adverse events including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcers</span>, gross <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. </p>
<p>NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcer</span> disease or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">gastrointestinal bleeding</span>.

Other factors that increase the risk for GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.</p>
<p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.</p>

<h2>Drug-Food Interactions </h2>
<p class="First">In a controlled single-dose study, administration of tolmetin with milk had no effect on peak plasma tolmetin concentrations, but decreased total tolmetin bioavailability by 16%. When tolmetin was taken immediately after a meal, peak plasma tolmetin concentrations were reduced by 50% while total bioavailability was again decreased by 16%.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility </h2>
<p class="First">Tolmetin sodium did not possess any carcinogenic liability in the following long-term studies: a 24-month study in rats at doses as high as 75 mg/kg/day, and an 18-month study in mice at doses as high as 50 mg/kg/day.</p>
<p>No mutagenic potential of tolmetin sodium was found in the Ames <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span>-Microsomal Activation Test. </p>
<p>Reproductive studies revealed no impairment of fertility in animals. Effects on parturition have been shown, however, as with other prostaglandin inhibitors. This information is detailed in the Pregnancy<span class="Bold">Â </span>section.</p>

</h3>
<p class="First">Reproduction studies in rats and rabbits at doses up to 50 mg/kg (1.5 times the maximum clinical dose based on a body weight of 60 kg) revealed no evidence of teratogenesis or impaired fertility due to tolmetin. However, animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Tolmetin should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<h2>Labor and Delivery </h2>
<p class="First">In rat studies with NSAIDs, as with other drugs known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, an increased incidence of dystocia, delayed parturition, and decreased pup survival occurred. The effects of tolmetin on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers </h2>
<p class="First">Tolmetin sodium has been shown to be secreted in human milk.

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS </h1>
<p class="First">The adverse reactions which have been observed in clinical trials encompass observations in about 4,370 patients treated with tolmetin sodium, over 800 of whom have undergone at least one year of therapy. These adverse reactions, reported below by body system, are among those typical of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and, as expected, gastrointestinal complaints were most frequent. In clinical trials with tolmetin, about 10% of patients dropped out because of adverse reactions, mostly gastrointestinal in nature.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION </h1>
<p class="First">Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of tolmetin sodium tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use tolmetin sodium tablets. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see <a href="#ID_f9eee01c-a115-49e6-bb70-bc176d076c94">WARNINGS</a>).</p>
<p>After observing the response to initial therapy with tolmetin sodium tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patientâ€™s needs.</p>
<p>For the relief of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80180" conceptname="Osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</span>, the recommended starting dose for adults is 400 mg three times daily (1200 mg daily), preferably including a dose on arising and a dose at bedtime. To achieve optimal therapeutic effect the dose should be adjusted according to the patientâ€™s response after 1 or 2 weeks. Control is usually achieved at doses of 600 mg to 1800 mg daily in divided doses (generally t.i.d.). Doses larger than 1800 mg/day have not been studied and are not recommended.</p>
<p>For the relief of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4253901" conceptname="Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis">juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</span>, the recommended starting dose for pediatric patients (2 years and older) is 20 mg/kg/day in divided doses (t.i.d. or q.i.d.). When control has been achieved, the usual dose ranges from 15 to 30 mg/kg/day. Doses higher than 30 mg/kg/day have not been studied, and, therefore, are not recommended.</p>
<p>A therapeutic response to tolmetin sodium can be expected in a few days to a week. Progressive improvement can be anticipated during succeeding weeks of therapy. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302537" conceptname="Digestive system finding">gastrointestinal symptoms</span> occur, tolmetin sodium tablets can be administered with antacids other than sodium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span>.
