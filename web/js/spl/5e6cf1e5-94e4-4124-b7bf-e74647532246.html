<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">The mechanism by which anagrelide reduces blood platelet count is still under investigation. Studies in patients support a hypothesis of dose-related reduction in platelet production resulting from a decrease in megakaryocyte hypermaturation. In blood withdrawn from normal volunteers treated with anagrelide, a disruption was found in the postmitotic phase of megakaryocyte development and a reduction in megakaryocyte size and ploidy. At therapeutic doses, anagrelide does not produce significant changes in white cell counts or coagulation parameters, and may have a small, but clinically insignificant effect on red cell parameters. Anagrelide inhibits cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase III (PDEIII).  PDEIII inhibitors can also inhibit platelet aggregation.  However, significant inhibition of platelet aggregation is observed only at doses of anagrelide higher than those required to reduce platelet count.</p>
<p>Following oral administration of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-anagrelide in people, more than 70% of radioactivity was recovered in urine. Based on limited data, there appears to be a trend toward dose linearity between doses of 0.5 mg and 2 mg. At fasting and at a dose of 0.5 mg of anagrelide, the plasma half-life is 1.3 hours. The available plasma concentration time data at steady state in patients showed that anagrelide does not accumulate in plasma after repeated administration.</p>
<p>Two major metabolites have been identified (RL603 and 3-hydroxy anagrelide).</p>
<p>There were no apparent differences between patient groups (pediatric versus adult patients) for t<span class="Sub">max</span> and for t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> for anagrelide, 3-hydroxy anagrelide, or RL603. </p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic data obtained from healthy volunteers comparing the pharmacokinetics of anagrelide in the fed and fasted states showed that administration of a 1 mg dose of anagrelide with food decreased the C<span class="Sub">max </span>by 14%, but increased the AUC by 20%.</p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic (PK) data from pediatric (age range 7 to 14 years) and adult (age range 16 to 86 years) patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280071" conceptname="Thrombocytosis">thrombocythemia</span> secondary to a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4175485" conceptname="Myeloproliferative disorder">myeloproliferative disorder</span> (MPD), indicate that dose- and body weight-normalized exposure, C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUCτ, of anagrelide were lower in the pediatric patients compared to the adult patients (C<span class="Sub">max</span> 48%, AUCτ 55%). </p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic data from fasting elderly patients with ET (age range 65 to 75 years) compared to fasting adult patients (age range 22 to 50 years) indicate that the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of anagrelide were 36% and 61% higher respectively in elderly patients, but that the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of the active metabolite, 3-hydroxy anagrelide, were 42% and 37% lower respectively in the elderly patients.</p>

The mean duration of anagrelide therapy for ET, PV, CML, and OMPD patients was 65, 67, 40, and 44 weeks, respectively; 23% of patients received treatment for 2 years. Patients were treated with anagrelide starting at doses of 0.5 to 2 mg every 6 hours. The dose was increased if the platelet count was still high, but to no more than 12 mg each day. Efficacy was defined as reduction of platelet count to or near physiologic levels (150,000 to 400,000/µL). The criteria for defining subjects as "responders" were reduction in platelets for at least 4 weeks to ≤600,000/µL, or by at least 50% from baseline value. Subjects treated for less than 4 weeks were not considered evaluable. The results are depicted graphically below: </p>

<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">Anagrelide therapy requires close clinical supervision of the patient. While the platelet count is being lowered (usually during the first two weeks of treatment), blood counts (hemoglobin, white blood cells) and renal function (serum creatinine, BUN) should be monitored. Cases of clinically significant hepatotoxicity (including symptomatic ALT and AST elevations and elevations greater than three times the ULN) have been reported in postmarketing surveillance. Measure liver function tests (ALT, AST) before initiating anagrelide treatment and during therapy.</p>
<p>In 9 subjects receiving a single 5 mg dose of anagrelide, standing blood pressure fell an average of 22/15 mm Hg, usually accompanied by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>.

<p>Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with the other common medications used concomitantly with anagrelide in clinical trials which were acetaminophen, furosemide, iron, ranitidine, hydroxyurea, and allopurinol.</p>
<p>Anagrelide is metabolized at least in part by CYP1A2. It is known that CYP1A2 is inhibited by several medicinal products, including fluvoxamine, and such medicinal products could theoretically adversely influence the clearance of anagrelide. Anagrelide demonstrates some limited inhibitory activity towards CYP1A2 which may present a theoretical potential for interaction with other coadministered medicinal products sharing that clearance mechanism e.g., theophylline.</p>
<p>Anagrelide is an inhibitor of cyclic AMP PDE III. The effects of medicinal products with similar properties such as inotropes milrinone, enoximone, amrinone, olprinone and cilostazol may be exacerbated by anagrelide.</p>
<p>There is a single case report which suggests that sucralfate may interfere with anagrelide absorption.</p>
<p>Food has no clinically significant effect on the bioavailability of anagrelide.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">In a two year rat carcinogenicity study a higher incidence of uterine adenocarcinoma, relative to controls, was observed in females receiving 30 mg/kg/day (at least 174 times human AUC exposure after a 1 mg twice daily dose). Adrenal phaeochromocytomas were increased relative to controls in males receiving 3 mg/kg/day and above, and in females receiving 10 mg/kg/day and above (at least 10 and 18 times respectively human AUC exposure after a 1 mg twice daily dose). Anagrelide hydrochloride was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> cell (L5178Y, TK<span class="Sup">+/-</span>) forward mutation test, the human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, or the mouse micronucleus test. Anagrelide hydrochloride at oral doses up to 240 mg/kg/day (1,440 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, 195 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male rats. However, in female rats, at oral doses of 60 mg/kg/day (360 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, 49 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area) or higher, it disrupted implantation when administered in early pregnancy and retarded or blocked parturition when administered in late pregnancy. </p>

<h3><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category C</span></h3>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Teratogenic Effects</span></p>
<p> Teratology studies have been performed in pregnant rats at oral doses up to 900 mg/kg/day (5,400 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, 730 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area) and in pregnant rabbits at oral doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (240 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, 32 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to anagrelide hydrochloride.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Nonteratogenic Effects</span></p>
<p>A fertility and reproductive performance study performed in female rats revealed that anagrelide hydrochloride at oral doses of 60 mg/kg/day (360 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, 49 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area) or higher disrupted implantation and exerted adverse effect on embryo/fetal survival.</p>
<p>A perinatal and postnatal study performed in female rats revealed that anagrelide hydrochloride at oral doses of 60 mg/kg/day (360 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, 49 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area) or higher produced delay or blockage of parturition, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> of non-delivering pregnant dams and their fully developed fetuses, and increased mortality in the pups born. </p>
<p>There are however no adequate and well-controlled studies with anagrelide hydrochloride in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, anagrelide hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. </p>

<h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2>
<p class="First">In the 2-year rat study, a significant increase in non-neoplastic lesions were observed in anagrelide treated males and females in the adrenal (medullary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4296894" conceptname="Hyperplasia">hyperplasia</span>), heart (myocardial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4210465" conceptname="Hypertrophy">hypertrophy</span> and chamber distension), kidney (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433811" conceptname="Hydronephrosis">hydronephrosis</span>, tubular dilation and urothelial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4296894" conceptname="Hyperplasia">hyperplasia</span>) and bone (femur enostosis). Vascular effects were observed in tissues of the pancreas (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314659" conceptname="Arteritis">arteritis</span>/periarteritis, intimal proliferation and medial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4210465" conceptname="Hypertrophy">hypertrophy</span>), kidney (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314659" conceptname="Arteritis">arteritis</span>/periarteritis, intimal proliferation and medial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4210465" conceptname="Hypertrophy">hypertrophy</span>), sciatic nerve (vascular mineralization), and testes (tubular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4028206" conceptname="Atrophy">atrophy</span> and vascular infarct) in anagrelide treated males. </p>
<p>Five women became pregnant while on anagrelide treatment at doses of 1 to 4 mg/day. Treatment was stopped as soon as it was realized that they were pregnant. All delivered normal, healthy babies. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Anagrelide hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. </p>
<p>Anagrelide is not recommended in women who are or may become pregnant. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. Women of child-bearing potential should be instructed that they must not be pregnant and that they should use contraception while taking anagrelide. Anagrelide may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. </p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reaction in nursing infants from anagrelide hydrochloride, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4175485" conceptname="Myeloproliferative disorder">Myeloproliferative disorders</span> are uncommon in pediatric patients and limited data are available in this population. An open label safety and PK/PD study (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>) was conducted in 17 pediatric patients 7 to 14 years of age (8 patients 7 to 11 years of age and 9 patients 11 to 14 years of age, mean age of 11 years; 8 males and 9 females) with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280071" conceptname="Thrombocytosis">thrombocythemia</span> secondary to ET as compared to 18 adult patients (mean age of 63 years, 9 males and 9 females). Prior to entry on to the study, 16 of 17 pediatric patients and 13 of 18 adult patients had received anagrelide treatment for an average of 2 years. The median starting total daily dose, determined by retrospective chart review, for pediatric and adult ET patients who had received anagrelide prior to study entry was 1 mg for each of the three age groups (7 to 11 and 11 to 14 year old patients and adults). The starting dose for 6 anagrelide-naive patients at study entry was 0.5 mg once daily. At study completion, the median total daily maintenance doses were similar across age groups, median of 1.75 mg for patients of 7 to 11 years of age, 2 mg in patients 11 to 14 years of age, and 1.5 mg for adults.</p>
<p>The study evaluated the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of anagrelide, including platelet counts (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>). </p>
<p>The frequency of adverse events observed in pediatric patients was similar to adult patients. The most common adverse events observed in pediatric patients were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318556" conceptname="Epistaxis">epistaxis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span> during a 3 months treatment of anagrelide in the study.

Episodes of increased pulse rate and decreased systolic or diastolic blood pressure beyond the normal ranges in the absence of clinical symptoms were observed in some patients. Reported AEs were consistent with the known pharmacological profile of anagrelide and the underlying disease. There were no apparent trends or differences in the types of adverse events observed between the pediatric patients compared with those of the adult patients. No overall difference in dosing and safety were observed between pediatric and adult patients. </p>
<p>In another open-label study, anagrelide had been used successfully in 12 pediatric patients (age range 6.8 to 17.4 years; 6 male and 6 female), including 8 patients with ET, 2 patients with CML, 1 patient with PV, and 1 patient with OMPD. Patients were started on therapy with 0.5 mg q.i.d. up to a maximum daily dose of 10 mg. The median duration of treatment was 18.1 months with a range of 3.1 to 92 months. Three patients received treatment for greater than three years. Other adverse events reported in spontaneous reports and literature reviews include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span>, cutaneous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4080920" conceptname="Phytophotodermatitis">photosensitivity</span> and elevated leukocyte count.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of anagrelide, 42.1% were 65 years and over, while 14.9% were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Analysis of the adverse events in a population consisting of 942 patients in 3 clinical studies diagnosed with myeloproliferative diseases of varying etiology (ET: 551; PV: 117; OMPD: 274) has shown that all disease groups have the same adverse event profile. While most reported adverse events during anagrelide therapy have been mild in intensity and have decreased in frequency with continued therapy, serious adverse events were reported in these patients.

<p>Of the 942 patients treated with anagrelide for a mean duration of approximately 65 weeks, 161 (17%) were discontinued from the study because of adverse events or abnormal laboratory test results. The most common adverse events for treatment discontinuation were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315078" conceptname="Palpitations">palpitation</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal pain</span>. Overall, the occurrence rate of all adverse events was 17.9 per 1,000 treatment days. The occurrence rate of adverse events increased at higher dosages of anagrelide.</p>
<p>The most frequently reported adverse reactions to anagrelide (in 5% or greater of 942 patients with myeloproliferative disease) in clinical trials were:</p>

<h2>Acute Toxicity and Symptoms</h2>
<p class="First">Single oral doses of anagrelide hydrochloride at 2,500, 1,500 and 200 mg/kg in mice, rats and monkeys, respectively, were not lethal. Symptoms of acute toxicity were: decreased motor activity in mice and rats and softened stools and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">decreased appetite</span> in monkeys. </p>
<p>There have been postmarketing case reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4244894" conceptname="Intentional drug overdose">intentional overdose</span> with anagrelide hydrochloride. Reported symptoms include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4007310" conceptname="Sinus tachycardia">sinus tachycardia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>.

Platelet reduction from anagrelide therapy is dose-related; therefore, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span>, which can potentially cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, is expected from overdosage. Should overdosage occur, cardiac and central nervous system toxicity can also be expected. </p>

<h2>Management and Treatment</h2>
<p class="First">In case of overdosage, close clinical supervision of the patient is required; this especially includes monitoring of the platelet count for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span>. Dosage should be decreased or stopped, as appropriate, until the platelet count returns to within the normal range.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Treatment with anagrelide hydrochloride capsules should be initiated under close medical supervision. The recommended starting dosage of anagrelide hydrochloride capsules for adult patients is 0.5 mg q.i.d. or 1 mg b.i.d (2 capsules of 0.5 mg twice a day), which should be maintained for at least one week. Starting doses in pediatric patients have ranged from 0.5 mg per day to 0.5 mg q.i.d. As there are limited data on the appropriate starting dose for pediatric patients, an initial dose of 0.5 mg per day is recommended. In both adult and pediatric patients, dosage should then be adjusted to the lowest effective dosage required to reduce and maintain platelet count below 600,000/µL, and ideally to the normal range. The dosage should be increased by not more than 0.5 mg/day in any one week. Maintenance dosing is not expected to be different between adult and pediatric patients. Dosage should not exceed 10 mg/day or 2.5 mg in a single dose (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>). </p>
<p>There are no special requirements for dosing the geriatric population.</p>
<p>It is recommended that patients with moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> start anagrelide therapy at a dose of 0.5 mg/day and be maintained for a minimum of one week with careful monitoring of cardiovascular effects. The dosage increment must not exceed more than 0.5 mg/day in any one week. The potential risks and benefits of anagrelide therapy in a patient with mild or moderate impairment of hepatic function should be assessed before treatment is commenced. Use of anagrelide in patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> has not been studied. Use of anagrelide in patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> is contraindicated (see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>).</p>
<p>To monitor the effect of anagrelide and prevent the occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span>, platelet counts should be performed every two days during the first week of treatment and at least weekly thereafter until the maintenance dosage is reached. </p>
<p>Typically, platelet count begins to respond within 7 to 14 days at the proper dosage. The time to complete response, defined as platelet count ≤600,000/µL, ranged from 4 to 12 weeks. Most patients will experience an adequate response at a dose of 1.5 to 3 mg/day. Patients with known or suspected heart disease, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>, or hepatic dysfunction should be monitored closely. </p>
