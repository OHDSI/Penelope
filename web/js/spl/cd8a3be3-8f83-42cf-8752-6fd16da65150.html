<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</h1>
<p class="First">Tazarotene is a retinoid prodrug which is converted to its active form, the cognate carboxylic acid of tazarotene (AGNÂ 190299), by rapid deesterification in animals and man. AGNÂ 190299 (â€œtazarotenic acidâ€?) binds to all three members of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) family: RARÎ±<span class="Sub">,</span> RARÎ², and RARÎ³, but shows relative selectivity for RARÎ², and RARÎ³ and may modify gene expression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.
</p>
<p>The mechanism of tazarotene action in the amelioration of fine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkling</span>, facial mottled hypo- and hyperpigmentation, and benign facial lentigines is unknown. A histological study of tazarotene cream 0.1% applied in subjects with fine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkling</span> and mottled hyperpigmentation but otherwise normal skin for 24Â weeks showed that tazarotene cream was associated with significantly greater proportions of patients who had an increase from baseline in the number of granular cell layers and in epidermal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span>. The clinical significance of these changes is unknown.
</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="43682-4">
<a name="s8"></a><a name="section-3.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Pharmacokinetics
</h2>
<p class="First">Following topical application, tazarotene undergoes esterase hydrolysis to form its active metabolite, tazarotenic acid. Little parent compound could be detected in the plasma. Tazarotenic acid was highly bound to plasma proteins (greater than 99%). Tazarotene and tazarotenic acid were metabolized to sulfoxides, sulfones, and other polar metabolites which were eliminated through urinary and fecal pathways. The half-life of tazarotenic acid was approximately 18 hours.
</p>
<p>Tazarotene cream 0.1% was topically applied once daily to either the face (6 females and 2 males) or to 15% of body surface area (8 females and 8 males) over four weeks in patients with fine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkling</span> and mottled hyperpigmentation. In the â€œface-onlyâ€? dosing group, the maximum average C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0-24hr</span> values of tazarotenic acid occurred on Day 15 with mean Â± SD values of C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0-24hr</span> of tazarotenic acid being 0.236 Â± 0.255 ng/mL (N=8) and 2.44 Â± 1.38 ngÂ·hr/mL (N=8), respectively. The mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0-24hr</span> values of tazarotenic acid from patients in the 15% body surface area dosing group were approximately 10 times higher than those from patients in the face-only dosing group. The single highest C<span class="Sub">max</span> throughout the study period was 3.43 ng/mL on day 29 from patients in the 15% body surface area dosing group. Gender had no influence on the systemic bioavailability of tazarotenic acid.
</p>
<p>Blood samples were collected from one of the two phase 3 studies to evaluate the systemic exposure following application of tazarotene cream 0.1% once daily for 24 weeks (double-blind period) followed by 28 weeks (open-label) under clinical conditions. The mean plasma tazarotenic acid concentrations following topical treatment with tazarotene cream 0.1% over 52 weeks ranged between 0.092 Â± 0.073 ng/mL and 0.127 Â± 0.142 ng/mL. The single highest observed tazarotenic acid concentration throughout the 52-week study was 0.705 ng/mL (observed at week 36). Systemic availability of tazarotenic acid was minimal and remained steady following once daily application of tazarotene cream 0.1% to the faces of patients in the study for up to 52 weeks.

<h2>Clinical Studies
</h2>
<p class="First">In two double-blind controlled studies in which tazarotene cream 0.1% was compared with its vehicle, applications were made once daily for 24 weeks to the facial skin of subjects with mild to severe fine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkling</span>, facial mottled hypo- and hyperpigmentation, and benign facial lentigines due to overexposure to the sun. Treatment was as an adjunct to a comprehensive skin care and sun avoidance program which included use of sunscreens, protective clothing, and non-prescription emollient cream. At two to four week intervals the severity of fine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkling</span>, mottled hypo- and hyperpigmentation, and benign facial lentigines were graded on a scale of 0 = none, 1 = minimal, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. The results of both studies demonstrate that tazarotene cream 0.1% was significantly superior to its vehicle for fine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkling</span>, mottled hypo- and hyperpigmentation, and benign facial lentigines expressed as the proportion of subjects with an improvement of at least one grade from baseline.
</p>
<p>Approximately 97% of subjects in clinical trials were white (Caucasian) with 80% of subjects in the clinical studies having Fitzpatrick skin type classifications I-III. The distribution of subject skin types were: Type I â€“12%; Type II â€“ 26%; Type III â€“ 40%; and Type IV 22%. Patients with skin types V and VI were not studied. Insufficient non-white patients (Asian, Hispanic, or other) were studied to make an adequate determination of efficacy of <span class="Bold">AVAGE<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> Cream in such patients.

<h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS
</h1>
<p class="First">Retinoids may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.<br></p>
<p>In rats, tazarotene 0.05% gel administered <span class="Bold">topically</span> during gestation days 6 through 17 at 0.25Â mg/kg/day resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. Rabbits dosed <span class="Bold">topically</span> with 0.25 mg/kg/day tazarotene gel during gestation days 6 through 18 were noted with single incidences of known retinoid malformations, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4283381" conceptname="Spina bifida">spina bifida</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4043738" conceptname="Hydrocephalus">hydrocephaly</span>, and heart anomalies.
</p>
<p>Systemic exposure (AUC<span class="Sub">0-24hr</span>) to tazarotenic acid at topical doses of 0.25 mg/kg/day tazarotene in a gel formulation in rats and rabbits represented 2.4 and 26 times, respectively, the maximum AUC<span class="Sub">0-24hr</span> in patients treated with 2 mg/cm<span class="Sup">2</span> of tazarotene cream 0.1% over 15% body surface area for fine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkling</span> and mottled hyperpigmentation.
</p>
<p>As with other retinoids, when tazarotene was given <span class="Bold">orally</span> to experimental animals, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436077" conceptname="Developmental delay">developmental delays</span> were seen in rats, and teratogenic effects and post-implantation loss were observed in rats and rabbits at doses producing 2.1 and 52 times, respectively, the maximum AUC<span class="Sub">0-24hr</span> in patients treated with 2 mg/cm<span class="Sup">2</span> of tazarotene cream 0.1% over 15% body surface area for fine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkling</span> and mottled hyperpigmentation.
</p>
<p>In a study of the effect of oral tazarotene on fertility and early embryonic development in rats, decreased number of implantation sites, decreased litter size, decreased number of live fetuses, and decreased fetal body weights, all classic developmental effects of retinoids, were observed when female rats were administered 2 mg/kg/day from 15 days before mating through gestation day 7. A low incidence of retinoid-related malformations at that dose were reported to be related to treatment. That dose produced an AUC<span class="Sub">0-24hr</span> that was 6.7 times the maximum AUC<span class="Sub">0-24hr</span> in patients treated with 2 mg/cm<span class="Sup">2</span> of tazarotene cream 0.1% over 15% body surface area for signs of fine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkling</span> and mottled hyperpigmentation.
</p>
<p>Systemic exposure to tazarotenic acid is dependent upon the extent of the body surface area treated. IN PATIENTS TREATED TOPICALLY OVER SUFFICIENT BODY SURFACE AREA, EXPOSURE COULD BE IN THE SAME ORDER OF MAGNITUDE AS IN THESE ORALLY TREATED ANIMALS. As a retinoid, tazarotene is a teratogenic substance, and it is not known what level of exposure is required for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> in humans. However, there may be less systemic exposure in the treatment of the face alone, due to less surface area for application (see <a href="#s8">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics</a>).
</p>
<p>There were thirteen reported pregnancies in patients who participated in the clinical trials for topical tazarotene. Nine of the patients were found to have been treated with topical tazarotene, and the other four had been treated with vehicle. One of the patients who was treated with tazarotene cream elected to terminate the pregnancy for non-medical reasons unrelated to treatment. The other eight pregnant women who were inadvertently exposed to topical tazarotene during the clinical trials subsequently delivered apparently healthy babies. As the exact timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestation times are not certain, the significance of these findings is unknown.

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
</h2>
<p class="First">A long term study of tazarotene following oral administration of 0.025, 0.050, and 0.125Â mg/kg/day to rats showed no indications of increased carcinogenic risks. Based on pharmacokinetic data from a shorter term study in rats, the highest dose of 0.125 mg/kg/day was anticipated to give systemic exposure in the rat equivalent to 1.4 times the maximum AUC<span class="Sub">0-24hr</span> in patients treated with 2 mg/cm<span class="Sup">2</span> of tazarotene cream 0.1% over 15% body surface area for fine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkling</span> and mottled hyperpigmentation.
</p>
<p>In evaluation of photo co-carcinogenicity, median time to onset of tumors was decreased, and the number of tumors increased in hairless mice following chronic topical dosing with intercurrent exposure to ultraviolet radiation at tazarotene concentrations of 0.001%, 0.005%, and 0.01% in a gel formulation for up to 40 weeks.
</p>
<p>A long-term topical application study of up to 0.1% tazarotene in a gel formulation in mice terminated at 88 weeks showed that dose levels of 0.05, 0.125, 0.25, and 1 mg/kg/day (reduced to 0.5 mg/kg/day for males after 41 weeks due to severe dermal irritation) revealed no apparent carcinogenic effects when compared to vehicle control animals; untreated control animals were not completely evaluated. Systemic exposure (AUC<span class="Sub">0-12hr</span>) at the highest dose was 7.8 times the maximum AUC<span class="Sub">0-24hr</span> in patients treated with 2 mg/cm<span class="Sup">2</span> of tazarotene cream 0.1% over 15% body surface area for fine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkling</span> and mottled hyperpigmentation.
</p>
<p>Tazarotene was found to be non-mutagenic in the Ames assays using <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span> and <span class="Italics">E. coli</span> and did not produce structural chromosomal aberrations in a human lymphocyte assay. Tazarotene was also non-mutagenic in the CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell forward gene mutation assay and was non-clastogenic in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test.
</p>
<p>No impairment of fertility occurred in rats when male animals were treated for 70 days prior to mating and female animals were treated for 14Â days prior to mating and continuing through gestation and lactation with topical doses of tazarotene gel up to 0.125Â mg/kg/day. Based on data from another study, the systemic drug exposure in the rat would be equivalent to 1.2 times the maximum AUC<span class="Sub">0-24hr</span> in patients treated with 2 mg/cm<span class="Sup">2</span> of tazarotene cream 0.1% over 15% body surface area for fine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkling</span> and mottled hyperpigmentation.
</p>
<p>No impairment of mating performance or fertility was observed in male rats treated for 70 days prior to mating with oral doses of up to 1 mg/kg/day tazarotene. That dose produced an AUC<span class="Sub">0-24hr</span> that was 3.7 times the maximum AUC<span class="Sub">0-24hr</span> in patients treated with 2 mg/cm<span class="Sup">2</span> of tazarotene cream 0.1% over 15% body surface area for fine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkling</span> and mottled hyperpigmentation.
</p>
<p>No effect on parameters of mating performance or fertility was observed in female rats treated for 15 days prior to mating and continuing through day 7 of gestation with oral doses of tazarotene up to 2 mg/kg/day. However, there was a significant decrease in the number of estrous stages and an increase in developmental effects at that dose (see <a href="#s11">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>). That dose produced an AUC<span class="Sub">0-24hr</span> that was 6.7 times the maximum AUC<span class="Sub">0-24hr</span> in patients treated with 2 mg/cm<span class="Sup">2</span> of tazarotene cream 0.1% over 15% body surface area for signs of fine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkling</span> and mottled hyperpigmentation.
</p>
<p>Reproductive capabilities of F1 animals, including F2 survival and development, were not affected by topical administration of tazarotene gel to female F0 parental rats from gestation day 16 through lactation day 20 at the maximum tolerated dose of 0.125Â mg/kg/day. Based on data from another study, the systemic drug exposure in the rat would be equivalent to 1.2 times the maximum AUC<span class="Sub">0-24hr</span> in patients treated with 2 mg/cm<span class="Sup">2</span> of tazarotene cream 0.1% over 15% body surface area for fine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkling</span> and mottled hyperpigmentation.

These actions help assure you are not pregnant when you begin use.
</li>
<li>If you get pregnant while using <span class="Bold">AVAGE<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> Cream, stop use and contact your doctor right away.
</li>
<li>Use <span class="Bold">AVAGE<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> Cream only under the guidance of your doctor as part of a total skin care program in which you avoid sunlight. This program should include avoiding sunlight as much as possible, using clothing to protect you from sunlight, using sunscreens with an SPF of 15 or higher, and using face creams that add moisture to your skin.
</li>
<li>Follow these directions:<ol class="Arabic">
<li>Use <span class="Bold">AVAGE<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> Cream once a day in the evening.
</li>
<li>In the evening, gently wash your face with mild soap. Pat your <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4039266" conceptname="Dry skin">skin dry</span> and wait 20-30 minutes before applying <span class="Bold">AVAGE<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> Cream.
</li>
<li>Be sure your skin is dry before you use <span class="Bold">AVAGE<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> Cream.
</li>
<li>Apply only a pea-sized amount (about Â¼ inch or 5 mm wide) to your face at one time. This should be enough to cover the wrinkled or discolored areas lightly. You can include your eyelids, if desired.
</li>
<li>Wash your hands after applying the medicine. If the cream gets on areas you do not need to treat, wash it off.
</li>
<li>In the morning, apply a moisturizing sunscreen of SPF 15 or greater.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>You can use a cream or lotion to soften or moisten your skin before or after you apply <span class="Bold">AVAGE<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> Cream. Just be sure there is no more of the first cream or lotion on your skin and your skin is dry before you apply the second product.
</li>
<li>Keep <span class="Bold">AVAGE<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> Cream out of your eyes and mouth. If it gets in your eyes, wash them off with large amounts of cool water. Contact your doctor if irritation continues.
</li>
<li>If you miss a dose, do not try to make it up. Continue with your normal schedule.
</li>
<li>In general, you can use facial moisturizers, such as lotions, oils, and creams, as often as you want. However, follow your doctor's advice for routine skin care and for using makeup, moisturizers, and sunscreens.
</li>
<li>Do not use more <span class="Bold">AVAGE<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> Cream than instructed or more often than instructed. Using larger amounts of medicine than recommended will not lead to faster or better results and may cause more side effects.
</li>
<li>Wear clothing that protects your skin from the sun, and use non-prescription creams to help keep your skin soft.
</li>
<li>Watch your reaction to <span class="Bold">AVAGE<span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> Cream carefully if you are also using other skin products or processes with strong drying or irritating effects. These include products with high amounts of alcohol, astringents, spices, lime peel, medicated or abrasive soaps, medicated shampoos, and permanent wave solution.
