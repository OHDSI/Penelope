<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Trandolapril is the ethyl ester prodrug of a nonsulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, trandolaprilat. Trandolapril is chemically described as (2S, 3aR, 7aS)-1-[(S)-N-[(S)-1-Carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]alanyl] hexahydro-2-indolinecarboxylic acid, 1-ethyl ester. Its empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">24</span>H<span class="Sub">34</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">5</span> and its structural formula is</p>

<a name="GN66767"></a><a name="section-2.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Trandolapril is deesterified to the diacid metabolite, trandolaprilat, which is approximately eight times more active as an inhibitor of ACE activity. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent peripheral vasoconstrictor that also stimulates secretion of aldosterone by the adrenal cortex and provides negative feedback for renin secretion. The effect of trandolapril in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> appears to result primarily from the inhibition of circulating and tissue ACE activity thereby reducing angiotensin II formation, decreasing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137788" conceptname="Vascular constriction">vasoconstriction</span>, decreasing aldosterone secretion, and increasing plasma renin. Decreased aldosterone secretion leads to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span>, natriuresis, and a small increase of serum potassium.  In controlled clinical trials, treatment with MAVIK alone resulted in mean increases in potassium of 0.1 mEq/L. (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS.</span>)</p>
<p>ACE is identical to kininase II, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin, a potent peptide vasodilator; whether increased levels of bradykinin play a role in the therapeutic effect of trandolapril remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>While the principal mechanism of antihypertensive effect is thought to be through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, trandolapril exerts antihypertensive actions even in patients with low-renin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>. MAVIK was an effective antihypertensive in all races studied. Both black patients (usually a predominantly low-renin group) and non-black patients responded to 2 to 4 mg of MAVIK.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</h2>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="GN66821"></a><a name="section-2.2.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3>
<p class="First">Trandolapril's ACE-inhibiting activity is primarily due to its diacid metabolite, trandolaprilat. Cleavage of the ester group of trandolapril, primarily in the liver, is responsible for conversion. Absolute bioavailability after oral administration of trandolapril is about 10% as trandolapril and 70% as trandolaprilat. After oral trandolapril under fasting conditions, peak trandolapril levels occur at about one hour and peak trandolaprilat levels occur between 4 and 10 hours. The elimination half-life of trandolapril is about 6 hours. At steady state, the effective half-life of trandolaprilat is 22.5 hours. Like all ACE inhibitors, trandolaprilat also has a prolonged terminal elimination phase, involving a small fraction of administered drug, probably representing binding to plasma and tissue ACE. During multiple dosing of trandolapril, there is no significant accumulation of trandolaprilat. Food slows absorption of trandolapril, but does not affect AUC or C<span class="Sub">max</span> of trandolaprilat or C<span class="Sub">max</span> of trandolapril.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="GN66853"></a><a name="section-2.2.2"></a><p></p>
<h3>Metabolism and Excretion</h3>
<p class="First">After oral administration of trandolapril, about 33% of parent drug and metabolites are recovered in urine, mostly as trandolaprilat, with about 66% in feces. The extent of the absorbed dose which is biliary excreted has not been determined. Plasma concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of trandolapril and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of trandolaprilat) are dose proportional over the 1-4 mg range, but the AUC of trandolaprilat is somewhat less than dose proportional. In addition to trandolaprilat, at least 7 other metabolites have been found, principally glucuronides or deesterification products.</p>
<p>Serum protein binding of trandolapril is about 80%, and is independent of concentration. Binding of trandolaprilat is concentration-dependent, varying from 65% at 1000 ng/mL to 94% at 0.1 ng/mL, indicating saturation of binding with increasing concentration.</p>
<p>The volume of distribution of trandolapril is about 18 liters. Total plasma clearances of trandolapril and trandolaprilat after approximately 2 mg IV doses are about 52 liters/hour and 7 liters/hour respectively. Renal clearance of trandolaprilat varies from 1-4 liters/hour, depending on dose.</p>

The plasma concentration of trandolapril is increased in elderly hypertensive patients, but the plasma concentration of trandolaprilat and inhibition of ACE activity are similar in elderly and young hypertensive patients. The pharmacokinetics of trandolapril and trandolaprilat and inhibition of ACE activity are similar in male and female elderly hypertensive patients.</p>

<p class="First">Compared to normal subjects, the plasma concentrations of trandolapril and trandolaprilat are approximately 2-fold greater and renal clearance is reduced by about 85% in patients with creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min and in patients on hemodialysis.  Dosage adjustment is recommended in renally impaired patients. (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>.)</p>

<h3>Drug Interactions</h3>
<p class="First">Trandolapril did not affect the plasma concentration (pre-dose and 2 hours post-dose) of oral digoxin (0.25 mg). Coadministration of trandolapril and cimetidine led to an increase of about 44% in C<span class="Sub">max</span> for trandolapril, but no difference in the pharmacokinetics of trandolaprilat or in ACE inhibition. Coadministration of trandolapril and furosemide led to an increase of about 25% in the renal clearance of trandolaprilat, but no effect was seen on the pharmacokinetics of furosemide or trandolaprilat or on ACE inhibition.</p>

<h2>Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects</h2>
<p class="First">A single 2-mg dose of MAVIK produces 70 to 85% inhibition of plasma ACE activity at 4 hours with about 10% decline at 24 hours and about half the effect manifest at 8 days. Maximum ACE inhibition is achieved with a plasma trandolaprilat concentration of 2 ng/mL. ACE inhibition is a function of trandolaprilat concentration, not trandolapril concentration. The effect of trandolapril on exogenous angiotensin I was not measured.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">Hypertension</span></h2>
<p class="First">Four placebo-controlled dose response studies were conducted using once-daily oral dosing of MAVIK in doses from 0.25 to 16 mg per day in 827 black and non-black patients with mild to moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>. The minimal effective once-daily dose was 1 mg in non-black patients and 2 mg in black patients. Further decreases in trough supine diastolic blood pressure were obtained in non-black patients with higher doses, and no further response was seen with doses above 4 mg (up to 16 mg). The antihypertensive effect diminished somewhat at the end of the dosing interval, but trough/peak ratios are well above 50% for all effective doses. There was a slightly greater effect on the diastolic pressure, but no difference on systolic pressure with b.i.d. dosing. During chronic therapy, the maximum reduction in blood pressure with any dose is achieved within one week. Following 6 weeks of monotherapy in placebo-controlled trials in patients with mild to moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, once-daily doses of 2 to 4 mg lowered supine or standing systolic/diastolic blood pressure 24 hours after dosing by an average 7-10/4-5 mmHg below placebo responses in non-black patients.  Once-daily doses of 2 to 4 mg <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314171" conceptname="Low blood pressure reading">lowered blood pressure</span> 4-6/3-4 mmHg in black patients. Trough to peak ratios for effective doses ranged from 0.5 to 0.9. There were no differences in response between men and women, but responses were somewhat greater in patients under 60 than in patients over 60 years old. Abrupt withdrawal of MAVIK has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure.</p>
<p>Administration of MAVIK to patients with mild to moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> results in a reduction of supine, sitting and standing blood pressure to about the same extent without compensatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>.</p>
<p>Symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> is infrequent, although it can occur in patients who are salt- and/or volume-depleted. (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>.) Use of MAVIK in combination with thiazide diuretics gives a blood pressure lowering effect greater than that seen with either agent alone, and the additional effect of trandolapril is similar to the effect of monotherapy.</p>

Patients tolerant of a test dose of 1 mg trandolapril were randomized to placebo (n=873) or trandolapril (n=876) and followed for 24 months. Among patients randomized to trandolapril, who began treatment on 1 mg, 62% were successfully titrated to a target dose of 4 mg once daily over a period of weeks. The use of trandolapril was associated with a 16% reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality (p=0.042), largely cardiovascular mortality. Trandolapril was also associated with a 20% reduction in the risk of progression of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> (p=0.047), defined by a time-to-first-event analysis of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> attributed to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, hospitalization for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, or requirement for open-label ACE inhibitor for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>.

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span></h2>
<p class="First">MAVIK can cause symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>. Like other ACE inhibitors, MAVIK has only rarely been associated with symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> in uncomplicated hypertensive patients. Symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> is most likely to occur in patients who have been salt- or volume-depleted as a result of prolonged treatment with diuretics, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>. Volume and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">salt depletion</span> should be corrected before initiating treatment with MAVIK.

<h2>Fetal Toxicity</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category D</span></p>
<p>Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. Resulting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090272" conceptname="Anuria">anuria</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue MAVIK as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus.</p>
<p>In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> is observed, discontinue MAVIK, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of <span class="Italics">in utero</span> exposure to MAVIK for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306451" conceptname="Oliguria">oliguria</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span> (See <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use</span>).</p>

<p class="First">As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with ACE inhibitors, including MAVIK (trandolapril), may be associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306451" conceptname="Oliguria">oliguria</span> and/or progressive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4261202" conceptname="Uremia">azotemia</span> and rarely with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.</p>
<p>In hypertensive patients with unilateral or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118795" conceptname="Renal artery stenosis">bilateral renal artery stenosis</span>, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine have been observed in some patients following ACE inhibitor therapy. These increases were almost always reversible upon discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor and/or diuretic therapy. In such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy.</p>
<p>Some hypertensive patients with no apparent preexisting renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when ACE inhibitors have been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with preexisting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>.

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Long-term studies were conducted with oral trandolapril administered by gavage to mice (78 weeks) and rats (104 and 106 weeks). No evidence of carcinogenic potential was seen in mice dosed up to 25 mg/kg/day (85 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day) or rats dosed up to 8 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day). These doses are 313 and 32 times (mice), and 100 and 23 times (rats) the maximum recommended human daily dose (MRHDD) of 4 mg based on body-weight and body-surface-area, respectively assuming a 50 kg individual. The genotoxic potential of trandolapril was evaluated in the microbial mutagenicity (Ames) test, the point mutation and chromosome aberration assays in Chinese hamster V79 cells, and the micronucleus test in mice. There was no evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic potential in these <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> assays.</p>
<p>Reproduction studies in rats did not show any impairment of fertility at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (710 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day) of trandolapril, or 1250 and 260 times the MRHDD on the basis of body-weight and body-surface-area, respectively.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">In placebo-controlled studies of MAVIK, 31.1% of patients were 60 years and older, 20.1% were 65 years and older, and 2.3% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between these patients and younger patients. (Greater sensitivity of some older individual patients cannot be ruled out).</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">The safety experience in U.S. placebo-controlled trials included 1069 hypertensive patients, of whom 832 received MAVIK. Nearly 200 hypertensive patients received MAVIK for over one year in open-label trials. In controlled trials, withdrawals for adverse events were 2.1% on placebo and 1.4% on MAVIK. Adverse events considered at least possibly related to treatment occurring in 1% of MAVIK-treated patients and more common on MAVIK than placebo, pooled for all doses, are shown below, together with the frequency of discontinuation of treatment because of these events.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">No data are available with respect to overdosage in humans. The oral LD<span class="Sub">50</span> of trandolapril in mice was 4875 mg/Kg in males and 3990 mg/Kg in females. In rats, an oral dose of 5000 mg/Kg caused low mortality (1 male out of 5; 0 females). In dogs, an oral dose of 1000 mg/Kg did not cause mortality and abnormal clinical signs were not observed. In humans, the most likely clinical manifestation would be symptoms attributable to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>. Symptoms also expected with ACE inhibitors are <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span>.</p>
<p>Laboratory determinations of serum levels of trandolapril and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of trandolapril <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. No data are available to suggest that physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) might accelerate elimination of trandolapril and its metabolites. Trandolaprilat is removed by hemodialysis. Angiotensin II could presumably serve as a specific antagonist antidote in the setting of trandolapril <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, but angiotensin II is essentially unavailable outside of scattered research facilities. Because the hypotensive effect of trandolapril is achieved through vasodilation and effective <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436375" conceptname="Hypovolemia">hypovolemia</span>, it is reasonable to treat trandolapril <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> by infusion of normal saline solution.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">Hypertension</span></h2>
<p class="First">The recommended initial dosage of MAVIK for patients not receiving a diuretic is 1 mg once daily in non-black patients and 2 mg in black patients. Dosage should be adjusted according to the blood pressure response. Generally, dosage adjustments should be made at intervals of at least 1 week. Most patients have required dosages of 2 to 4 mg once daily. There is little clinical experience with doses above 8 mg.</p>
<p>Patients inadequately treated with once-daily dosing at 4 mg may be treated with twice-daily dosing. If blood pressure is not adequately controlled with MAVIK monotherapy, a diuretic may be added.</p>
<p>In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> occasionally can occur following the initial dose of MAVIK. To reduce the likelihood of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, the diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued two to three days prior to beginning therapy with MAVIK. (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>.) Then, if blood pressure is not controlled with MAVIK alone, diuretic therapy should be resumed. If the diuretic cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 0.5 mg MAVIK should be used with careful medical supervision for several hours until blood pressure has stabilized. The dosage should subsequently be titrated (as described above) to the optimal response. (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS</span> and <span class="Bold">DRUG INTERACTIONS</span>.)</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of MAVIK with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes, or potassium sparing diuretics can lead to increases of serum potassium. (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>.)</p>

<p class="First">The recommended starting dose is 1 mg, once daily. Following the initial dose, all patients should be titrated (as tolerated) toward a target dose of 4 mg, once daily. If a 4 mg dose is not tolerated, patients can continue therapy with the greatest tolerated dose.</p>
