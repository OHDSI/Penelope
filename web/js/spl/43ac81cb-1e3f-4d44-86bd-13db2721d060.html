<p>ZALEPLON </p>
<p>Zaleplon is a white to off-white powder that is practically insoluble in 
water and sparingly soluble in alcohol or propylene glycol. Its partition 
coefficient in octanol/water is constant (log PC = 1.23) over the pH range of 1 
to 7. </p>
<p>Sonata<span class="Sup">®</span> capsules contain zaleplon as the active 
ingredient. Inactive ingredients consist of microcrystalline cellulose, 
pregelatinized starch, silicon dioxide, sodium lauryl sulfate, magnesium 
stearate, lactose, gelatin, titanium dioxide, D&amp;C yellow #10, FD&amp;C blue 
#1, FD&amp;C green #3, and FD&amp;C yellow #5. </p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<a href="http://"></a>Pharmacodynamics and Mechanism of Action <p class="First">While Sonata (zaleplon) is a hypnotic agent with a chemical 
structure unrelated to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or other drugs with known 
hypnotic properties, it interacts with the gamma-aminobutyric 
acid-benzodiazepine (GABA-BZ) receptor complex. Subunit modulation of the 
GABA-BZ receptor chloride channel macromolecular complex is hypothesized to be 
responsible for some of the pharmacological properties of benzodiazepines, which 
include sedative, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsive effects in 
animal models. </p>
<p>Other nonclinical studies have also shown that zaleplon binds selectively to 
the brain omega-1 receptor situated on the alpha subunit of the GABA<span class="Sub">A</span>/chloride ion channel receptor complex and potentiates 
t-butyl-bicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding. Studies of binding of zaleplon 
to recombinant GABA<span class="Sub">A</span> receptors (α<span class="Sub">1</span>β<span class="Sub">1</span>γ<span class="Sub">2</span> [omega-1] 
and α<span class="Sub">2</span>β<span class="Sub">1</span>γ<span class="Sub">2</span> 
[omega-2]) have shown that zaleplon has a low affinity for these receptors, with 
preferential binding to the omega-1 receptor. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pharmacokinetics <p>The pharmacokinetics of zaleplon have been investigated in more 
than 500 healthy subjects (young and elderly), nursing mothers, and patients 
with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>. In healthy subjects, the pharmacokinetic 
profile has been examined after single doses of up to 60 mg and once-daily 
administration at 15 mg and 30 mg for 10 days. Zaleplon was rapidly absorbed 
with a time to peak concentration (t<span class="Sub">max</span>) of approximately 
1 hour and a terminal-phase elimination half-life (t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>) 
of approximately 1 hour. Zaleplon does not accumulate with once-daily 
administration and its pharmacokinetics are dose proportional in the therapeutic 
range. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Absorption</span><p>Zaleplon is rapidly and almost completely absorbed following oral 
administration. Peak plasma concentrations are attained within approximately 1 
hour after oral administration. Although zaleplon is well absorbed, its absolute 
bioavailability is approximately 30% because it undergoes significant 
presystemic metabolism. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Distribution</span><p>Zaleplon is a lipophilic compound with a volume of distribution 
of approximately 1.4 L/kg following intravenous (IV) administration, indicating 
substantial distribution into extravascular tissues. The in vitro plasma protein 
binding is approximately 60%±15% and is independent of zaleplon concentration 
over the range of 10 ng/mL to 1000 ng/mL. This suggests that zaleplon 
disposition should not be sensitive to alterations in protein binding. The blood 
to plasma ratio for zaleplon is approximately 1, indicating that zaleplon is 
uniformly distributed throughout the blood with no extensive distribution into 
red blood cells. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span><p>After oral administration, zaleplon is extensively metabolized, 
with less than 1% of the dose excreted unchanged in urine. Zaleplon is primarily 
metabolized by aldehyde oxidase to form 5-oxo-zaleplon. Zaleplon is metabolized 
to a lesser extent by cytochrome P<span class="Sub">450</span> (CYP) 3A4 to form 
desethylzaleplon, which is quickly converted, presumably by aldehyde oxidase, to 
5-oxo-desethylzaleplon. These oxidative metabolites are then converted to 
glucuronides and eliminated in urine. All of zaleplon's metabolites are 
pharmacologically inactive. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Elimination</span><p>After either oral or IV administration, zaleplon is rapidly 
eliminated with a mean t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> of approximately 1 hour. The 
oral-dose plasma clearance of zaleplon is about 3 L/h/kg and the IV zaleplon 
plasma clearance is approximately 1 L/h/kg. Assuming normal hepatic blood flow 
and negligible renal clearance of zaleplon, the estimated hepatic extraction 
ratio of zaleplon is approximately 0.7, indicating that zaleplon is subject to 
high first-pass metabolism. </p>
<p>After administration of a radiolabeled dose of zaleplon, 70% of the 
administered dose is recovered in urine within 48 hours (71% recovered within 6 
days), almost all as zaleplon metabolites and their glucuronides. An additional 
17% is recovered in feces within 6 days, most as 5-oxo-zaleplon. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Effect of Food</span><p>In healthy adults a high-fat/heavy meal prolonged the absorption 
of zaleplon compared to the fasted state, delaying t<span class="Sub">max</span> 
by approximately 2 hours and reducing C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 
approximately 35%. Zaleplon AUC and elimination half-life were not significantly 
affected. These results suggest that the effects of Sonata on sleep onset may be 
reduced if it is taken with or immediately after a high-fat/heavy meal. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Special Populations</span><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p>Age: The pharmacokinetics of Sonata (zaleplon) have been 
investigated in three studies with elderly men and women ranging in age from 65 
to 85 years. The pharmacokinetics of Sonata in elderly subjects, including those 
over 75 years of age, are not significantly different from those in young 
healthy subjects. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p>Gender: There is no significant difference in the 
pharmacokinetics of Sonata in men and women. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p>Race: The pharmacokinetics of zaleplon have been studied in 
Japanese subjects as representative of Asian populations. For this group, C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC were increased 37% and 64%, respectively. This 
finding can likely be attributed to differences in body weight, or 
alternatively, may represent differences in enzyme activities resulting from 
differences in diet, environment, or other factors. The effects of race on 
pharmacokinetic characteristics in other ethnic groups have not been well 
characterized. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic impairment</span>: Zaleplon is metabolized primarily by the 
liver and undergoes significant presystemic metabolism. Consequently, the oral 
clearance of zaleplon was reduced by 70% and 87% in compensated and 
decompensated cirrhotic patients, respectively, leading to marked increases in 
mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC (up to 4-fold and 7-fold in compensated 
and decompensated patients, respectively), in comparison with healthy subjects. 
The dose of Sonata should therefore be reduced in patients with mild to moderate 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#section-12">DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION</a></span>). Sonata is not recommended for use in patients with 
severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal impairment</span>: Because renal excretion of unchanged zaleplon 
accounts for less than 1% of the administered dose, the pharmacokinetics of 
zaleplon are not altered in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>. No dose 
adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>. 
Sonata has not been adequately studied in patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>. 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Drug-Drug Interactions <p>Because zaleplon is primarily metabolized by aldehyde oxidase, 
and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4, inhibitors of these enzymes might be expected 
to decrease zaleplon's clearance and inducers of these enzymes might be expected 
to increase its clearance. Zaleplon has been shown to have minimal effects on 
the kinetics of warfarin (both R- and S- forms), imipramine, ethanol, ibuprofen, 
diphenhydramine, thioridazine, and digoxin. However, the effects of zaleplon on 
inhibition of enzymes involved in the metabolism of other drugs have not been 
studied. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#section-8.4">Drug 
Interactions</a></span> under <span class="Bold"><a href="#section-8">PRECAUTIONS.</a></span>) </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Clinical Trials <a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><span class="Underline">Controlled Trials Supporting Effectiveness</span></span></span><p>Sonata (typically administered in doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, or 20 mg) 
has been studied in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">chronic insomnia</span> (n = 3,435) in 12 placebo- 
and active-drug-controlled trials. Three of the trials were in elderly patients 
(n = 1,019). It has also been studied in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">transient insomnia</span> (n = 264). Because 
of its very short half-life, studies focused on decreasing sleep latency, with 
less attention to duration of sleep and number of awakenings, for which 
consistent differences from placebo were not demonstrated. Studies were also 
carried out to examine the time course of effects on memory and psychomotor 
function, and to examine withdrawal phenomena. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">Transient Insomnia</span> <p>Normal adults experiencing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">transient insomnia</span> during the first 
night in a sleep laboratory were evaluated in a double-blind, parallel-group 
trial comparing the effects of two doses of Sonata (5 mg and 10 mg) with 
placebo. Sonata 10 mg, but not 5 mg, was superior to placebo in decreasing 
latency to persistent sleep (LPS), a polysomnographic measure of time to onset 
of sleep. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">Chronic Insomnia</span> <a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Non-elderly patients: <p>Adult outpatients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">chronic insomnia</span> were evaluated in three 
double-blind, parallel-group outpatient studies, one of 2 weeks duration and two 
of 4 weeks duration, that compared the effects of Sonata at doses of 5 mg (in 
two studies), 10 mg, and 20 mg with placebo on a subjective measure of time to 
sleep onset (TSO). Sonata 10 mg and 20 mg were consistently superior to placebo 
for TSO, generally for the full duration of all three studies. Although both 
doses were effective, the effect was greater and more consistent for the 20-mg 
dose. The 5-mg dose was less consistently effective than were the 10-mg and 
20-mg doses. Sleep latency with Sonata 10 mg and 20 mg was on the order of 10-20 
minutes (15%-30%) less than with placebo in these studies. </p>
<p>Adult outpatients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">chronic insomnia</span> were evaluated in six double-blind, 
parallel-group sleep laboratory studies that varied in duration from a single 
night up to 35 nights. Overall, these studies demonstrated a superiority of 
Sonata 10 mg and 20 mg over placebo in reducing LPS on the first 2 nights of 
treatment. At later time points in 5-, 14-, and 28-night studies, a reduction in 
LPS from baseline was observed for all treatment groups, including the placebo 
group, and thus, a significant difference between Sonata and placebo was not 
seen beyond 2 nights. In a 35-night study, Sonata 10 mg was significantly more 
effective than placebo in reducing LPS at the primary efficacy endpoint on 
nights 29 and 30. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Elderly patients: <p>Elderly outpatients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">chronic insomnia</span> were evaluated in two 
2-week, double-blind, parallel-group outpatient studies that compared the 
effects of Sonata 5 mg and 10 mg with placebo on a subjective measure of time to 
sleep onset (TSO). Sonata at both doses was superior to placebo on TSO, 
generally for the full duration of both studies, with an effect size generally 
similar to that seen in younger persons. The 10-mg dose tended to have a greater 
effect in reducing TSO. </p>
<p>Elderly outpatients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">chronic insomnia</span> were also evaluated in a 2-night 
sleep laboratory study involving doses of 5 mg and 10 mg. Both 5-mg and 10-mg 
doses of Sonata were superior to placebo in reducing latency to persistent sleep 
(LPS). </p>
<p>Generally in these studies, there was a slight increase in sleep duration, 
compared to baseline, for all treatment groups, including placebo, and thus, a 
significant difference from placebo on sleep duration was not demonstrated.

generally revealed the expected impairment of short-term memory at 1 hour, the 
time of peak exposure to zaleplon, for both doses, with a tendency for the 
effect to be greater after 20 mg. Consistent with the rapid clearance of 
zaleplon, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4304008" conceptname="Memory impairment">memory impairment</span> was no longer present as early as 2 hours post

tolerance or adaptation to some effects of hypnotics may develop. If the drug 
has a short elimination half-life, it is possible that a relative deficiency of 
the drug or its active metabolites (ie, in relationship to the receptor site) 
may occur at some point in the interval between each night's use. This sequence 
of events is believed to be responsible for two clinical findings reported to 
occur after several weeks of nightly use of other rapidly eliminated hypnotics: 
increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4100068" conceptname="Wakefulness">wakefulness</span> during the last quarter of the night and the appearance of 
increased signs of daytime <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>. </p>
<p>Zaleplon has a short half-life and no active metabolites. At the primary 
efficacy endpoint (nights 29 and 30) in a 35-night sleep laboratory study, 
polysomnographic recordings showed that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4100068" conceptname="Wakefulness">wakefulness</span> was not significantly longer 
with Sonata than with placebo during the last quarter of the night. No increase 
in the signs of daytime <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> was observed in clinical trials with Sonata. In 
two sleep laboratory studies involving 14- and 28-nightly doses of Sonata (5 mg 
and 10 mg in one study and 10 mg and 20 mg in the second) and structured 
assessments of daytime <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, no increases in daytime <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> were detected. 
Similarly, in a pooled analysis (all the parallel-group, placebo-controlled 
studies) of spontaneously reported daytime <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, no difference was observed 
between Sonata and placebo. </p>
<p>Rebound <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, defined as a dose-dependent temporary worsening in sleep 
parameters (latency, total sleep time, and number of awakenings) compared to 
baseline following discontinuation of treatment, is observed with short- and 
intermediate-acting hypnotics. Rebound <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> following discontinuation of 
Sonata relative to baseline was examined at both nights 1 and 2 following 
discontinuation in three sleep laboratory studies (14, 28, and 35 nights) and 
five outpatient studies utilizing patient diaries (14 and 28 nights). Overall, 
the data suggest that rebound <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> may be dose dependent. At 20 mg, there 
appeared to be both objective (polysomnographic) and subjective (diary) evidence 
of rebound <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> on the first night after discontinuation of treatment with 
Sonata. At 5 mg and 10 mg, there was no objectiveand minimal subjective evidence 
of rebound <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> on the first night after discontinuation of treatment with 
Sonata. At all doses, the rebound effect appeared to resolve by the second night 
following withdrawal. In the 35-night study, there was a worsening in sleep on 
the first night off for both the 10-mg and 20-mg groups compared to placebo, but 
not to baseline. This discontinuation-emergent effect was mild, had the 
characteristics of the return of the symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">chronic insomnia</span>, and appeared 
to resolve by the second night after zaleplon discontinuation. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Other Withdrawal-Emergent Phenomena <p>The potential for other withdrawal phenomena was also assessed in 
14- to 28-night studies, including both the sleep laboratory studies and the 
outpatient studies, and in open-label studies of 6- and 12-month durations. The 
Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Symptom Questionnaire was used in several of these 
studies, both at baseline and then during days 1 and 2 following 
discontinuation. Withdrawal was operationally defined as the emergence of 3 or 
more new symptoms after discontinuation. Sonata was not distinguishable from 
placebo at doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, or 20 mg on this measure, nor was Sonata 
distinguishable from placebo on spontaneously reported withdrawal-emergent 
adverse events. There were no instances of withdrawal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373995" conceptname="Delirium">delirium</span>, withdrawal

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First">Because <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435524" conceptname="Sleep disorder">sleep disturbances</span> may be the presenting manifestation of 
a physical and/or psychiatric disorder, symptomatic treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> should 
be initiated only after a careful evaluation of the patient. <span class="Bold">The failure of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may 
indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that 
should be evaluated.</span> Worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> or the emergence of new 
thinking or behavior abnormalities may be the consequence of an unrecognized 
psychiatric or physical disorder. Such findings have emerged during the course 
of treatment with sedative/hypnotic drugs, including Sonata. Because some of the 
important adverse effects of Sonata appear to be dose-related, it is important 
to use the lowest possible effective dose, especially in the elderly (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#section-12">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>). </p>
<p>A variety of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4131797" conceptname="Disturbance in thinking">abnormal thinking</span> and behavior changes have been reported to 
occur in association with the use of sedative/hypnotics. Some of these changes 
may be characterized by decreased inhibition (eg, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021344" conceptname="Abusive behavior">aggressiveness</span> and

other neuropsychiatric symptoms may occur unpredictably. In primarily depressed 
patients, worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, including suicidal thinking, has been 
reported in association with the use of sedative/hypnotics. </p>
<p>It can rarely be determined with certainty whether a particular instance of 
the abnormal behaviors listed above is drug induced, spontaneous in origin, or a 
result of an underlying psychiatric or physical disorder. Nonetheless, the 
emergence of any new behavioral sign or symptom of concern requires careful and 
immediate evaluation. </p>
<p>Following rapid dose decrease or abrupt discontinuation of the use of 
sedative/hypnotics, there have been reports of signs and symptoms similar to 
those associated with withdrawal from other CNS-depressant drugs (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#section-10">DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></a></span>). </p>
<p>Sonata, like other hypnotics, has CNS-depressant effects. <span class="Underline">Because of the rapid onset of action, Sonata should only be 
ingested immediately prior to going to bed or after the patient has gone to bed 
and has experienced difficulty <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falling</span> asleep</span>. Patients receiving Sonata 
should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete 
mental alertness or motor coordination (eg, operating machinery or driving a 
motor vehicle) after ingesting the drug, including potential impairment of the 
performance of such activities that may occur the day following ingestion of 
Sonata. Sonata, as well as other hypnotics, may produce additive CNS-depressant

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<a href="http://"></a>General <a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Timing of Drug 
Administration</span><p class="First">Sonata should be taken immediately before bedtime or after the 
patient has gone to bed and has experienced difficulty <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falling</span> asleep. As with 
all sedative/hypnotics, taking Sonata while still up and about may result in

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Use in the elderly and/or 
debilitated patients</span><p>Impaired motor and/or cognitive performance after repeated 
exposure or unusual sensitivity to sedative/hypnotic drugs is a concern in the 
treatment of elderly and/or debilitated patients. A dose of 5 mg is recommended 
for elderly patients to decrease the possibility of side effects (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#section-12">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>). Elderly 
and/or debilitated patients should be monitored closely. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Use in patients with concomitant 
illness </span><p>Clinical experience with Sonata in patients with concomitant 
systemic illness is limited. Sonata should be used with caution in patients with 
diseases or conditions that could affect metabolism or hemodynamic responses. 
</p>
<p>Although preliminary studies did not reveal respiratory depressant effects at 
hypnotic doses of Sonata in normal subjects, caution should be observed if 
Sonata (zaleplon) is prescribed to patients with compromised respiratory 
function, because sedative/hypnotics have the capacity to depress respiratory 
drive. Controlled trials of acute administration of Sonata 10 mg in patients 
with mild to moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255573" conceptname="Chronic obstructive lung disease">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</span> or moderate 
obstructive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313459" conceptname="Sleep apnea">sleep apnea</span> showed no evidence of alterations in blood gases or

respiration due to preexisting illness should be monitored carefully. </p>
<p>The dose of Sonata should be reduced to 5 mg in patients with mild to 
moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#section-12">DOSAGE

severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>. </p>
<p>No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal 
impairment. Sonata has not been adequately studied in patients with severe renal 
impairment. </p>

<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span></span><p>As with other sedative/hypnotic drugs, Sonata should be 
administered with caution to patients exhibiting signs or symptoms of 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>. Suicidal tendencies may be present in such patients and protective 
measures may be required. Intentional overdosage is more common in this group of 
patients (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#section-11">OVERDOSAGE</a></span>); 
therefore, the least amount of drug that is feasible should be prescribed for 
the patient at any one time. </p>

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Information for Patients <p>Patient information is printed at the end of this insert. To

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Laboratory Tests <p>There are no specific laboratory tests recommended. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Drug Interactions <p>As with all drugs, the potential exists for interaction with 
other drugs by a variety of mechanisms. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">CNS-Active Drugs</span><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p>Ethanol: Sonata 10 mg potentiated the CNS-impairing effects of 
ethanol 0.75 g/kg on balance testing and reaction time for 1 hour after ethanol 
administration and on the digit symbol substitution test (DSST), symbol copying 
test, and the variability component of the divided attention test for 2.5 hours 
after ethanol administration. The potentiation resulted from a CNS 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacodynamic interaction</span>; zaleplon did not affect the pharmacokinetics of 
ethanol. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p>Imipramine: Coadministration of single doses of Sonata 20 mg and 
imipramine 75 mg produced additive effects on decreased alertness and impaired 
psychomotor performance for 2 to 4 hours after administration. The interaction 
was pharmacodynamic with no alteration of the pharmacokinetics of either drug. 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p>Paroxetine: Coadministration of a single dose of Sonata 20 mg and 
paroxetine 20 mg daily for 7 days did not produce any interaction on psychomotor 
performance. Additionally, paroxetine did not alter the pharmacokinetics of 
Sonata, reflecting the absence of a role of CYP2D6 in zaleplon's metabolism. 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p>Thioridazine: Coadministration of single doses of Sonata 20 mg 
and thioridazine 50 mg produced additive effects on decreased alertness and 
impaired psychomotor performance for 2 to 4 hours after administration. The 
interaction was pharmacodynamic with no alteration of the pharmacokinetics of 
either drug. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p>Venlafaxine: Coadministration of a single dose of zaleplon 10 mg 
and multiple doses of venlafaxine ER (extended release) 150 mg did not result in 
any significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of either zaleplon of 
venlafaxine. In addition, there was no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacodynamic interaction</span> as a result 
of coadministration of zaleplon and venlafaxine ER. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p>Promethazine: Coadministration of a single dose of zaleplon and 
promethazine (10 and 25 mg, respectively) resulted in a 15% decrease in maximal 
plasma concentrations of zaleplon, but no change in the area under the plasma 
concentration-time curve. however, the pharmacodynamics of coadministration of 
zaleplon and promethazine have not been evaluated. Caution should be exercised 
when these 2 agents are coadministered. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Drugs That Induce CYP3A4</span><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p>Rifampin: CYP3A4 is ordinarily a minor metabolizing enzyme of 
zaleplon. Multiple-dose administration of the potent CYP3A4 inducer rifampin 
(600 mg every 24 hours, q24h, for 14 days), however, reduced zaleplon C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC by approximately 80%. The coadministration of a 
potent CYP3A4 enzyme inducer, although not posing a safety concern, thus could 
lead to ineffectiveness of zaleplon. An alternative non-CYP3A4 substrate 
hypnotic agent may be considered in patients taking CYP3A4 inducers such as 
rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Drugs That Inhibit CYP3A4</span><p>CYP3A4 is a minor metabolic pathway for the elimination of 
zaleplon because the sum of desethylzaleplon (formed via CYP3A4 in vitro) and 
its metabolites, 5-oxo-desethylzaleplon and 5-oxo-desethylzaleplon glucuronide, 
account for only 9% of the urinary recovery of a zaleplon dose. Coadministration 
of single, oral doses of zaleplon with erythromycin (10 mg and 800 mg 
respectively), a strong, selective CYP3A4 inhibitor, produced a 34% increase in 
zaleplon's maximal plasma concentrations and a 20% increase in the area under 
the plasma concentration-time curve. The magnitude of interaction with multiple 
doses of erythromycin is unknown. Other strong selective CYP3A4 inhibitors such 
as ketoconazole can also be expected to increase the exposure of zaleplon. A 
routine dosage adjustment of zaleplon is not considered necessary. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Drugs That Inhibit Aldehyde 
Oxidase</span><p>The aldehyde oxidase enzyme system is less well studied than the 
cytochrome P450 enzyme system. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p>Diphenhydramine: Diphenhydramine is reported to be a weak 
inhibitor of aldehyde oxidase in rat liver, but its inhibitory effects in human 
liver are not known. There is no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interaction</span> between zaleplon 
and diphenhydramine following the administration of a single dose (10 mg and 50 
mg, respectively) of each drug. However, because both of these compounds have 
CNS effects, an additive pharmacodynamic effect is possible. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Drugs That Inhibit Both Aldehyde 
Oxidase and CYP3A4</span><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p>Cimetidine: Cimetidine inhibits both aldehyde oxidase (in vitro) 
and CYP3A4 (in vitro and in vivo), the primary and secondary enzymes, 
respectively, responsible for zaleplon metabolism. Concomitant administration of 
Sonata (10 mg) and cimetidine (800 mg) produced an 85% increase in the mean 
C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of zaleplon. An initial dose of 5 mg should 
be given to patients who are concomitantly being treated with cimetidine (see 
<span class="Bold"><a href="#section-12">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>). 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma 
Protein</span><p>Zaleplon is not highly bound to plasma proteins (fraction bound 
60%±15%); therefore, the disposition of zaleplon is not expected to be sensitive 
to alterations in protein binding. In addition, administration of Sonata to a 
patient taking another drug that is highly protein bound should not cause 
transient increase in free concentrations of the other drug. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Drugs with a Narrow Therapeutic 
Index </span><p>Digoxin: Sonata (10 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetic or 
pharmacodynamic profile of digoxin (0.375 mg q24h for 8 days). </p>
<p>Warfarin: Multiple oral doses of Sonata (20 mg q24h for 13 days) did not 
affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin (R+)- or (S-)-enantiomers or the 
pharmacodynamics (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time) following a single 25-mg oral dose of 
warfarin. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Drugs That Alter Renal 
Excretion</span><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p>Ibuprofen: Ibuprofen is known to affect renal function and, 
consequently, alter the renal excretion of other drugs. There was no apparent 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interaction</span> between zaleplon and ibuprofen following single dose 
administration (10 mg and 600 mg, respectively) of each drug. This was expected 
because zaleplon is primarily metabolized and renal excretion of unchanged 
zaleplon accounts for less than 1% of the administered dose. </p>

Fertility <a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Carcinogenesis</span><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p>Lifetime carcinogenicity studies of zaleplon were conducted in 
mice and rats. Mice received doses of 25 mg/kg/day, 50 mg/kg/day, 100 mg/kg/day, 
and 200 mg/kg/day in the diet for two years. These doses are equivalent to 6 to 
49 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. There was a significant increase in the incidence of 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4301500" conceptname="Liver cell adenoma">hepatocellular adenomas</span> in female mice in the high dose group. Rats received 
doses of 1 mg/kg/day, 10 mg/kg/day, and 20 mg/kg/day in the diet for two years. 
These doses are equivalent to 0.5 to 10 times the maximum recommended human dose 
(MRHD) of 20 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. Zaleplon was not 
carcinogenic in rats. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Mutagenesis</span><p>Zaleplon was clastogenic, both in the presence and absence of 
metabolic activation, causing structural and numerical aberrations (polyploidy 
and endoreduplication), when tested for chromosomal aberrations in the in vitro 
Chinese hamster ovary cell assay. In the in vitro human lymphocyte assay, 
zaleplon caused numerical, but not structural, aberrations only in the presence 
of metabolic activation at the highest concentrations tested. In other in vitro 
assays, zaleplon was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial gene mutation assay or 
the Chinese hamster ovary HGPRT gene mutation assay. Zaleplon was not 
clastogenic in two in vivo assays, the mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay and 
the rat bone marrow chromosomal aberration assay, and did not cause DNA damage 
in the rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis assay. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Impairment of Fertility</span><p>In a fertility and reproductive performance study in rats, 
mortality and decreased fertility were associated with administration of an oral 
dose of zaleplon of 100 mg/kg/day to males and females prior to and during 
mating. This dose is equivalent to 49 times the maximum recommended human dose 
(MRHD) of 20 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. Follow-up studies 
indicated that impaired fertility was due to an effect on the female. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C <p>In embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits, oral 
administration of up to 100 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day, respectively, to 
pregnant animals throughout organogenesis produced no evidence of 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span>. These doses are equivalent to 49 (rat) and 48 (rabbit) times the 
maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> 
basis. In rats, pre- and postnatal growth was reduced in the offspring of dams 
receiving 100 mg/kg/day. This dose was also maternally toxic, as evidenced by 
clinical signs and decreased maternal body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span> during gestation. The 
no-effect dose for rat offspring growth reduction was 10 mg/kg (a dose 
equivalent to 5 times the MRHD of 20 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> 
basis). No adverse effects on embryofetal development were observed in rabbits 
at the doses examined. </p>
<p>In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443213" conceptname="Stillbirth">stillbirth</span> and 
postnatal mortality, and decreased growth and physical development, were 
observed in the offspring of females treated with doses of 7 mg/kg/day or 
greater during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation. There was 
no evidence of maternal toxicity at this dose. The no-effect dose for offspring 
development was 1 mg/kg/day (a dose equivalent to 0.5 times the MRHD of 20 mg on 
a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). When the adverse effects on offspring 
viability and growth were examined in a cross-fostering study, they appeared to 
result from both <span class="Italics">in utero</span> and lactational exposure to 
the drug. </p>
<p>There are no studies of zaleplon in pregnant women; therefore, Sonata<span class="Sup">®</span> (zaleplon)is not recommended for use in women during 
pregnancy. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Labor and Delivery <p>Sonata has no established use in labor and delivery. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Nursing Mothers <p>A study in lactating mothers indicated that the clearance and 
half-life of zaleplon is similar to that in young normal subjects. A small 
amount of zaleplon is excreted in breast milk, with the highest excreted amount 
occurring during a feeding at approximately 1 hour after Sonata administration. 
Since the small amount of the drug from breast milk may result in potentially 
important concentrations in infants, and because the effects of zaleplon on a 
nursing infant are not known, it is recommended that nursing mothers not take 
Sonata. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pediatric Use <p>The safety and effectiveness of Sonata in pediatric patients have 
not been established. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Geriatric Use <p>A total of 628 patients in double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group clinical trials who received Sonata were at least 65 years of 
age; of these, 311 received 5 mg and 317 received 10 mg. In both sleep 
laboratory and outpatient studies, elderly patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> responded to a 
5 mg dose with a reduced sleep latency, and thus 5 mg is the recommended dose in 
this population. During short-term treatment (14 night studies) of elderly 
patients with Sonata, no adverse event with a frequency of at least 1% occurred 
at a significantly higher rate with either 5 mg or 10 mg Sonata than with 
placebo. </p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">The premarketing development program for Sonata included zaleplon 
exposures in patients and/or normal subjects from 2 different groups of studies: 
approximately 900 normal subjects in clinical pharmacology/pharmacokinetic 
studies; and approximately 2,900 exposures from patients in placebo-controlled 
clinical effectiveness studies, corresponding to approximately 450 patient 
exposure years. The conditions and duration of treatment with Sonata varied 
greatly and included (in overlapping categories) open-label and double-blind 
phases of studies, inpatients and outpatients, and short-term or longer-term 
exposure. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse events, results 
of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analyses, and ECGs. 
</p>
<p>Adverse events during exposure were obtained primarily by general inquiry and 
recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. 
Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the 
proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping 
similar types of events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. 
In the tables and tabulations that follow, COSTART terminology has been used to 
classify reported adverse events. </p>
<p>The stated frequencies of adverse events represent the proportion of 
individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse event 
of the type listed. An event was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred 
for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline 
evaluation. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Adverse Findings Observed in Short-Term, 
Placebo-Controlled Trials <a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Adverse Events Associated With 
Discontinuation of Treatment </span><p>In premarketing placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase 2 and 
phase 3 clinical trials, 3.1% of 744 patients who received placebo and 3.7% of 
2,149 patients who received Sonata discontinued treatment because of an adverse 
clinical event. This difference was not statistically significant. No event that 
resulted in discontinuation occurred at a rate of greater than or equal to 1%. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Adverse Events Occurring at an 
Incidence of 1% or More Among Sonata 20 mg-Treated Patients</span><p><a href="#t1">Table 1</a> enumerates the incidence of 
treatment-emergent adverse events for a pool of three 28-night and one 35-night 
placebo-controlled studies of Sonata at doses of 5 mg or 10 mg and 20 mg. The 
table includes only those events that occurred in 1% or more of patients treated 
with Sonata 20 mg and that had a higher incidence in patients treated with 
Sonata 20 mg than in placebo-treated patients. </p>
<p>The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict 
the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where 
patient characteristics and other factors differ from those which prevailed in 
the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with 
figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different 
treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the 
prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution 
of drug and non-drug factors to the adverse event incidence rate in the 
population studied. </p>

</table>1: Events for which the 
incidence for Sonata 20 mg-treated patients was at least 1% and greater than the 
incidence among placebo-treated patients. Incidence greater than 1% has been 
rounded to the nearest whole number. <a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Other Adverse Events Observed During the Premarketing 
Evaluation of Sonata <p>Listed below are COSTART terms that reflect treatment-emergent 
adverse events as defined in the introduction to the <span class="Bold"><a href="#section-9">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span> section. These events were 
reported by patients treated with Sonata (zaleplon) at doses in a range of 5 
mg/day to 20 mg/day during premarketing phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials 
throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe, including approximately 2,900 
patients. All reported events are included except those already listed in <a href="#t1">Table 1</a> or elsewhere in labeling, those events for which a drug 
cause was remote, and those event terms that were so general as to be 
uninformative. It is important to emphasize that although the events reported 
occurred during treatment with Sonata, they were not necessarily caused by it. 
</p>
<p>Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of 
decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: <span class="Bold">frequent</span> adverse events are those occurring on one or more 
occasions in at least 1/100 patients; <span class="Bold">infrequent</span> adverse 
events are those occurring in less than 1/100 patients but at least 1/1,000 
patients; <span class="Bold">rare </span>events are those occurring in fewer than 
1/1,000 patients. </p>

<h1>DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></h1>
<a href="http://"></a>Controlled Substance Class <p class="First">Sonata is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance by 
federal regulation. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Abuse, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">Dependence</span>, and Tolerance <a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> and tolerance. Abuse is characterized by misuse of the drug for 
non-medical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. 
Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> is a state of adaption that is manifested by a specific 
withdrawal syndrome that can be produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose 
reduction, decreasing blood level of the drug and/or administration of an 
antagonist. Tolerance is a state of adaptation in which exposure to a drug 
induces changes that result in a diminution of one or more of the drug's effects 
over time. Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of 
drugs and may develop at different rates for different effects.</p>
<p>Addiction is a primary, chronic, neurobiological disease with genetic, 
psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and 
manifestations. It is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the 
following: impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite 
harm, and craving. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug addiction</span> is a treatable disease, utilizing a 
multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Abuse</span><p>Two studies assessed the abuse liability of Sonata at doses of 25 
mg, 50 mg, and 75 mg in subjects with known histories of sedative drug abuse. 
The results of these studies indicate that Sonata has an abuse potential similar 
to benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine-like hypnotics. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">Dependence</span></span><p>The potential for developing physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> on Sonata and a 
subsequent withdrawal syndrome was assessed in controlled studies of 14-, 28-, 
and 35-night durations and in open-label studies of 6- and 12-month durations by 
examining for the emergence of rebound <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> following drug discontinuation. 
Some patients (mostly those treated with 20 mg) experienced a mild rebound 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> on the first night following withdrawal that appeared to be resolved by 
the second night. The use of the Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Symptom Questionnaire 
and examination of any other withdrawal-emergent events did not detect any other 
evidence for a withdrawal syndrome following abrupt discontinuation of Sonata 
therapy in pre-marketing studies. </p>
<p>However, available data cannot provide a reliable estimate of the incidence 
of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> during treatment at recommended doses of Sonata. Other 
sedative/hypnotics have been associated with various signs and symptoms 
following abrupt discontinuation, ranging from mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4148767" conceptname="Dysphoric mood">dysphoria</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> to a

one of which had a prior <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span>, in clinical trials with Sonata. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">Seizures</span> and 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> have been seen following the withdrawal of zaleplon from animals at doses 
many times higher than those proposed for human use. Because individuals with a 
history of addiction to, or abuse of, drugs or alcohol are at risk of 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4036424" conceptname="Drug tolerance">habituation</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>, they should be under careful surveillance when 
receiving Sonata or any other hypnotic. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Italics">Tolerance</span><p>Possible tolerance to the hypnotic effects of Sonata 10 mg and 20 
mg was assessed by evaluating time to sleep onset for Sonata compared with 
placebo in two 28-night placebo-controlled studies and latency to persistent 
sleep in one 35-night placebo-controlled study where tolerance was evaluated on 
nights 29 and 30. No development of tolerance to Sonata was observed for time to 
sleep onset over 4 weeks. </p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">There is limited pre-marketing clinical experience with the 
effects of an overdosage of Sonata. Two cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> were reported. One was 
the accidental ingestion by a 2½ year old boy of 20 mg to 40 mg of zaleplon. The 
second was a 20 year old man who took 100 mg zaleplon plus 2.25 mg of triazolam. 
Both were treated and recovered uneventfully. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Signs and Symptoms <p>Signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> effects of CNS depressants can be 
expected to present as exaggerations of the pharmacological effects noted in 
preclinical testing. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">Overdose</span> is usually manifested by degrees of central 
nervous system <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> ranging from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>. In mild cases, 
symptoms include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">mental confusion</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4061577" conceptname="Lethargy">lethargy</span>; in more serious 
cases, symptoms may include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437584" conceptname="Ataxia">ataxia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">hypotonia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, respiratory 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, rarely <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>, and very rarely <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Recommended Treatment <p>General symptomatic and supportive measures should be used along 
with immediate gastric lavage where appropriate. Intravenous fluids should be 
administered as needed. Animal studies suggest that flumazenil is an antagonist 
to zaleplon. However, there is no pre-marketing clinical experience with the use 
of flumazenil as an antidote to a Sonata <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. As in all cases of drug 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, respiration, pulse, blood pressure, and other appropriate signs should 
be monitored and general supportive measures employed. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> and CNS 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> should be monitored and treated by appropriate medical intervention. 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Poison Control Center <p>As with the management of all overdosage, the possibility of 
multiple drug ingestion should be considered. The physician may wish to consider 
contacting a poison control center for up-to-date information on the management 
of hypnotic drug product overdosage. </p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34068-7">
<a name="section-11"></a><p></p>
<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">The dose of Sonata should be individualized. The recommended dose 
of Sonata for most nonelderly adults is 10 mg. For certain <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435372" conceptname="Underweight">low weight</span> 
individuals, 5 mg may be a sufficient dose. Although the risk of certain adverse 
events associated with the use of Sonata appears to be dose dependent, the 20 mg 
dose has been shown to be adequately tolerated and may be considered for the 
occasional patient who does not benefit from a trial of a lower dose. Doses 
above 20 mg have not been adequately evaluated and are not recommended. </p>
<p>Sonata should be taken immediately before bedtime or after the patient has 
gone to bed and has experienced difficulty <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falling</span> asleep (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#section-8">PRECAUTIONS.</a></span>). Taking Sonata with or 
immediately after a heavy, high-fat meal results in slower absorption and would 
be expected to reduce the effect of Sonata on sleep latency (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#section-4.2">Pharmacokinetics</a></span> under <span class="Bold"><a href="#section-4">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span>). </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Special Populations <p>Elderly patients and debilitated patients appear to be more 
sensitive to the effects of hypnotics, and respond to 5 mg of Sonata. The 
recommended dose for these patients is therefore 5 mg. Doses over 10 mg are not 
recommended. </p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">Hepatic insufficiency</span>: Patients with mild to moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> 
should be treated with Sonata 5 mg because clearance is reduced in this 
population. Sonata is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment. </p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal insufficiency</span>: No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to 
moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>. Sonata has not been adequately studied in patients 
with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>. </p>
<p>An initial dose of 5 mg should be given to patients concomitantly taking 
cimetidine because zaleplon clearance is reduced in this population (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#section-8.4">Drug Interactions</a></span> under <span class="Bold"><a href="#section-8">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>). </p>

<h1>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS TAKING SONATA</h1>
<p class="First">Your doctor has prescribed Sonata to help you sleep. The 
following information is intended to guide you in the safe use of this medicine. 
It is not meant to take the place of your doctor's instructions. If you have any 
questions about Sonata capsules, be sure to ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>Sonata is used to treat difficulty in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falling</span> asleep. Sonata works very 
quickly and has its effect during the first part of the night, since it is 
rapidly eliminated by the body. You should take Sonata immediately before going 
to bed or after you have gone to bed and are having difficulty <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falling</span> asleep. 
If your principal sleep difficulty is awakening prematurely after <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falling</span> 
asleep, there is no evidence that Sonata will be helpful to you. For Sonata to 
help you <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> asleep you should not take it with or immediately after a 
high-fat/heavy meal. </p>
<p>Sonata belongs to a group of medicines known as the “hypnotics?, or simply, 
sleep medicines. There are many different sleep medicines available to help 
people sleep better. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435524" conceptname="Sleep disorder">Sleep problems</span> are usually temporary, requiring treatment 
for only a short time, usually 1 or 2 days up to 1 or 2 weeks. Some people have 
chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435524" conceptname="Sleep disorder">sleep problems</span> that may require more prolonged use of sleep medicine. 
However, you should not use these medicines for long periods without talking 
with your doctor about the risks and benefits of prolonged use. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Who should not take Sonata</span></p>
<p>Do not take Sonata if you are hypersensitive to its active substance, 
zaleplon, or to any of its inactive ingredients, including tartrazine (FD&amp;C 
Yellow No. 5). </p>
<p>This product contains FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause 
allergic-type reactions (including bronchial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>) in certain susceptible 
persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) 
sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients 
who also have aspirin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span>. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Side Effects</span></p>
<p>All medicines have side effects. The most common side effects of sleep 
medicines are: </p>
<ul>
<li><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">Drowsiness</span> </li>
<li><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">Dizziness</span> </li>
<li><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">Lightheadedness</span> </li>
<li>Difficulty with coordination </li>
</ul>
<p>These side effects with Sonata occur most often within an hour after taking 
it, so it is especially important to take it only when you are about to go to 
bed or are already in bed. </p>
<p>Severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergic reactions</span>, sometimes with difficulty in breathing and 
possibly life threatening, have been reported and may require immediate medical 
care. </p>
<p>Sleep medicines can make you <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepy</span> during the day. How drowsy you feel 
depends upon how your body reacts to the medicine, which sleep medicine you are 
taking, and how large a dose your doctor has prescribed. Daytime <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> is 
best avoided by taking the lowest dose possible that will still help you sleep 
at night. Your doctor will work with you to find the dose of Sonata that is best 
for you. Sonata generally does not cause next-day <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> but a few people 
have reported this. </p>
<p>To manage these side effects while you are taking this medicine: </p>- When you first start taking Sonata or any other sleep medicine, until you 
know whether the medicine will still have some carryover effect in you the next 
day, use extreme care while doing anything that requires complete alertness, 
such as driving a car, operating machinery, or piloting an aircraft. - NEVER drink alcohol while you are being treated with Sonata or any sleep 
medicine. Alcohol can increase the side effects of Sonata or any other sleep 
medicine. - Do not take any other medicines without asking your doctor first. This 
includes medicines you can buy without a prescription. Some medicines can cause 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> and are best avoided while taking Sonata. - Always take the exact dose of Sonata prescribed by your doctor. Never change 
your dose without talking to your doctor first. <p><span class="Bold">Special Concerns</span></p>
<p>There are some special problems that may occur while taking sleep medicines. 
</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Memory Problems</span></p>
<p>Sleep medicines may cause a special type of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439147" conceptname="Amnesia">memory loss</span> or “amnesia.? When 
this occurs, a person may not remember what has happened for several hours after 
taking the medicine. This is usually not a problem since most people <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> asleep 
after taking the medicine. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439147" conceptname="Amnesia">Memory loss</span> can be a problem, however, when sleep 
medicines are taken while traveling, such as during an airplane flight and the 
person wakes up before the effect of the medicine is gone. This has been called 
“traveler's <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439147" conceptname="Amnesia">amnesia</span>.? Memory problems are not common while taking Sonata. In 
most instances memory problems can be avoided if you take Sonata only when you 
are able to get 4 or more hours of sleep before you need to be active again. Be 
sure to talk to your doctor if you think you are having memory problems. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Tolerance</span></p>
<p>When sleep medicines are used every night for more than a few weeks, they may 
lose their effectiveness to help you sleep. This is known as “tolerance.? 
Development of tolerance to Sonata has not been observed in outpatient clinical 
studies of up to 4 weeks in duration; however, it is unknown if the benefits of 
Sonata in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falling</span> asleep more quickly persist beyond 4 weeks. Sleep medicines 
should, in most cases, be used only for short periods of time, such as 1 or 2 
days and generally no longer than 1 or 2 weeks. If your <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435524" conceptname="Sleep disorder">sleep problems</span> continue, 
consult your doctor, who will determine whether other measures are needed to 
overcome your <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435524" conceptname="Sleep disorder">sleep problems</span>. </p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">Dependence</span> </span></p>
<p>Sleep medicines can cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>, especially when these medicines are 
used regularly for longer than a few weeks or at high doses. Some people develop 
a need to continue taking their medicines. This is known as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> or 
“addiction.? </p>
<p>When people develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>, they may have difficulty stopping the sleep 
medicine. If the medicine is suddenly stopped, the body is not able to function 
normally and unpleasant symptoms (see <span class="Italics"><a href="#section-14.1">Withdrawal</a></span>) may occur. They may find they have 
to keep taking the medicine either at the prescribed dose or at increasing doses 
just to avoid withdrawal symptoms. </p>
<p>All people taking sleep medicines have some risk of becoming dependent on the 
medicine. However, people who have been dependent on alcohol or other drugs in 
the past may have a higher chance of becoming addicted to sleep medicines. This 
possibility must be considered before using these medicines for more than a few 
weeks. If you have been addicted to alcohol or drugs in the past, it is 
important to tell your doctor before starting Sonata or any sleep medicine. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Withdrawal</span></p>
<p>Withdrawal symptoms may occur when sleep medicines are stopped suddenly after 
being used daily for a long time. In some cases, these symptoms can occur even 
if the medicine has been used for only a week or two. In mild cases, withdrawal 
symptoms may include unpleasant feelings. In more severe cases, abdominal and 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75635" conceptname="Cramp">muscle cramps</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">shakiness</span>, and rarely, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> may occur. 
These more severe withdrawal symptoms are very uncommon. Although withdrawal 
symptoms have not been observed in the relatively limited controlled trials 
experience with Sonata, there is, nevertheless, the risk of such events in 
association with the use of any sleep medicines. </p>
<p>Another problem that may occur when sleep medicines are stopped is known as 
“rebound <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>.? This means that a person may have more trouble sleeping the 
first few nights after the medicine is stopped than before starting the 
medicine. If you should experience rebound <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, do not get discouraged. 
This problem usually goes away on its own after 1 or 2 nights. </p>
<p>If you have been taking Sonata or any other sleep medicine for more than 1 or 
2 weeks, do not stop taking it on your own. Always follow your doctor's 
directions. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Changes In Behavior and Thinking</span></p>
<p>Some people using sleep medicines have experienced unusual changes in their 
thinking and/or behavior. These effects are not common. However, they have 
included: </p>- more outgoing or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021344" conceptname="Abusive behavior">aggressive behavior</span> than normal - loss of personal identity - <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> - strange behavior - <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span> - <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span> - worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> - suicidal thoughts <p>How often these effects occur depends on several factors, such as a person's 
general health, the use of other medicines, and which sleep medicine is being 
used. Clinical experience with Sonata (zaleplon) suggests that it is uncommonly 
associated with these behavior changes. </p>
<p>It is also important to realize that it is rarely clear whether these 
behavior changes are caused by the medicine, an illness, or occur on their own. 
In fact, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435524" conceptname="Sleep disorder">sleep problems</span> that do not improve may be due to illnesses that were 
present before the medicine was used. If you or your family notice any changes 
in your behavior, or if you have any unusual or disturbing thoughts, call your 
doctor immediately. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Pregnancy and Breastfeeding</span></p>
<p>Sleep medicines may cause sedation or other potential effects in the unborn 
baby when used during the last weeks of pregnancy. Therefore, Sonata is not 
recommended for use during pregnancy. Be sure to tell your doctor if you are 
pregnant, if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you become pregnant 
while taking Sonata. </p>
<p>In addition, a very small amount of Sonata may be present in breast milk 
after use of the medication. The effects of very small amounts of Sonata on an 
infant are not known; therefore, as with all other hypnotics, it is recommended 
that you not take Sonata if you are breastfeeding a baby. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Safe Use of Sleeping Medicines</span></p>
<p>To ensure the safe and effective use of Sonata or any other sleep medicine, 
you should observe the following cautions: </p>
<ol>
<li>Sonata is a prescription medicine and should be used ONLY as directed by 
your doctor. Follow your doctor's instructions about how to take, when to take, 
and how long to take Sonata. </li>
<li>Never use Sonata or any other sleep medicine for longer than directed by 
your doctor. </li>
<li>If you notice any unusual and/or disturbing thoughts or behavior during 
treatment with Sonata or any other sleep medicine, contact your doctor. </li>
<li>Tell your doctor about any medicines you may be taking, including medicines 
you may buy without a prescription. You should also tell your doctor if you 
drink alcohol. DO NOT use alcohol while taking Sonata or any other sleep 
medicine. </li>
<li>Do not take Sonata unless you are able to get 4 or more hours of sleep 
before you must be active again. </li>
<li>Do not increase the prescribed dose of Sonata or any other sleep medicine 
unless instructed by your doctor. </li>
<li>When you first start taking Sonata or any other sleep medicine, until you 
know whether the medicine will still have some carryover effect in you the next 
day, use extreme care while doing anything that requires complete alertness, 
such as driving a car, operating machinery, or piloting an aircraft. </li>
<li>Be aware that you may have more sleeping problems the first night or two 
after stopping any sleep medicine. </li>
<li>Be sure to tell your doctor if you are pregnant, if you are planning to 
become pregnant, if you become pregnant, or are breastfeeding a baby while 
taking Sonata. </li>
<li>As with all prescription medicines, never share Sonata or any other sleep 
medicine with anyone else. Always store Sonata or any other sleep medicine in 
the original container and out of reach of children. </li>
<li>Be sure to tell your physician if you suffer from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>. </li>
<li>Sonata works very quickly. You should only take Sonata immediately before 
going to bed or after you have gone to bed and are having difficulty <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falling</span> 
asleep. </li>
<li>For Sonata to work best, you should not take Sonata with or immediately 
after a high-fat/heavy meal. </li>
<li>Some people should start with the lowest dose (5 mg) of Sonata; these 
include the elderly (ie, ages 65 and over) and people with liver disease. 
</li>
