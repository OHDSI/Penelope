<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<br><p class="First">Prochlorperazine is a propylpiperazine derivative of phenothiazine. Like other phenothiazines, it exerts an antiemetic effect through a depressant action on the chemoreceptor trigger zone. It also has a clinically useful antipsychotic effect. Following intramuscular administration of prochlorperazine edisylate, the drug has an onset of action within ten to twenty minutes and a duration of action of three to four hours.</p>

Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic drug treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> is unknown.<br><br>Both the risk of developing the syndrome and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase.

Antipsychotic drug treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying disease process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.<br><br>Given these considerations, antipsychotic drugs should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>.

In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.<br><br>If signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> appear in a patient on antipsychotics, drug discontinuation should be considered.

The symptoms are persistent and in some patients appear to be irreversible.

<h1>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">NOTE ON INJECTION:</span> For intramuscular administration, inject deeply into the upper, outer quadrant of the buttock. <br><span class="Bold">Subcutaneous administration is not advisable because of local irritation. <br>Stability</span><br>This solution should be protected from light. Slight yellowish discoloration will not alter potency. If markedly discolored, solution should be discarded. <br><br><span class="Bold">Compatibility <br></span>It is recommended that Prochlorperazine Edisylate Injection not be mixed with other agents in the syringe. <br><br><span class="Bold">Adults<br></span>(For children's dosage and administration, see below.) Dosage should be increased more gradually in debilitated or emaciated patients.<br>ELDERLY PATIENTS <br>In general, dosages in the lower range are sufficient for most elderly patients. Since they appear to be more susceptible to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> and neuromuscular reactions, such patients should be observed closely. Dosage should be tailored to the individual, response carefully monitored, and dosage adjusted accordingly. Dosage should be increased more gradually in elderly patients.<br><br>TO CONTROL SEVERE <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">NAUSEA</span> AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">VOMITING</span> <br>Adjust dosage to the response of the individual. Begin with lowest recommended dosage.<br><br><span class="Italics">IM Dosage <br></span>Initially 5 mg to 10 mg (1 to 2 mL) injected <span class="Italics">deeply</span> into the upper, outer quadrant of the buttock. If necessary, repeat every 3 or 4 hours. Total IM dosage should not exceed 40 mg per day. <br><br><span class="Italics">IV Dosage<br></span>2.5 mg to 10 mg (0.5 to 2 mL) by slow IV injection or infusion at a rate not to exceed 5 mg per minute. Prochlorperazine Edisylate Injection may be administered either undiluted or diluted in isotonic solution. A single dose of the drug should not exceed 10 mg; total IV dosage should not exceed 40 mg per day. When administered IV, do not use bolus injection. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> is a possibility if the drug is given by IV injection or infusion.<br><br><span class="Bold">Subcutaneous administration is not advisable because of local irritation.<br></span>ADULT SURGERY (FOR SEVERE <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">NAUSEA</span> AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">VOMITING</span>) <br>Total parenteral dosage should not exceed 40 mg per day. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> is a possibility if the drug is given by IV injection or infusion.<br><span class="Italics">IM Dosage <br>5 mg to 10 mg (1 to 2 mL) 1 to 2 hours before induction of anesthesia (repeat once in 30 minutes, if necessary), or to control acute symptoms during and after surgery (repeat once if necessary).<br>IV Dosage <br>5 mg to 10 mg (1 to 2 mL) as a slow IV injection or infusion 15 to 30 minutes before induction of anesthesia, or to control acute symptoms during or after surgery. Repeat once if necessary. Prochlorperazine may be administered either undiluted or diluted in isotonic solution, but a single dose of the drug should not exceed 10 mg. The rate of administration should not exceed 5 mg per minute. When administered IV, do not use bolus injection.<br><br></span>IN ADULT PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS <br>Adjust dosage to the response of the individual and according to the severity of the condition. Begin with the lowest recommended dose. Although response ordinarily is seen within a day or two, longer treatment is usually required before maximal improvement is seen.<br><span class="Italics">IM Dosage <br></span>For immediate control of adult schizophrenic patients with severe symptomatology, inject an initial dose of 10 mg to 20 mg (2 to 4 mL) <span class="Italics">deeply</span> into the upper, outer quadrant of the buttock. Many patients respond shortly after the first injection. If necessary, however, repeat the initial dose every 2 to 4 hours (or, in resistant cases, every hour) to gain control of the patient. More than 3 or 4 doses are seldom necessary. After control is achieved, switch patient to an oral form of the drug at the same dosage level or higher. If, in rare cases, parenteral therapy is needed for a prolonged period, give 10 mg to 20 mg (2 to 4 mL) every 4 to 6 hours. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">Pain</span> and irritation at the site of injection have seldom occurred. <br><br><span class="Bold">Subcutaneous administration is not advisable because of local irritation.<br>Children <br>DO NOT USE IN PEDIATRIC SURGERY<br></span>Children seem more prone to develop extrapyramidal reactions, even on moderate doses. Therefore, use lowest effective dosage.

It should not be used in conditions for which children’s dosages have not been established. Dosage and frequency of administration should be adjusted according to the severity of the symptoms and the response of the patient. The duration of activity following intramuscular administration may last up to 12 hours. Subsequent doses may be given by the same route if necessary. <br><br><span class="Italics">IM Dosage</span><br>Calculate each dose on the basis of 0.06 mg of the drug per <span class="Bold">lb</span> of body weight; give by deep IM injection.
