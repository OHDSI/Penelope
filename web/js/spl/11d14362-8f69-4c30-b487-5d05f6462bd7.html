<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Quinidine is an antimalarial schizonticide and an antiarrhythmic agent with class
1a activity; it is the d–isomer of quinine and its molecular weight
is 324.43. Quinidine gluconate
is the gluconate salt of quinidine; its chemical name is cinchonan–9–ol, 6'–methoxy–,
(9<span class="Italics">S</span>)–,
mono–D–gluconate; its structural formula is</p>

and its molecular weight is 520.58, of which 62.3% is quinidine base.</p>
<p>Each vial of Quinidine Gluconate Injection
contains 800 mg (1.5 mmol) of quinidine gluconate (500
mg of quinidine)
in 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, 0.005% of edetate disodium, 0.25%
phenol, and (as needed) D–gluconic acid δ–lactone to adjust
the pH.</p>

<h2></h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism —</span> After intramuscular
injection of quinidine gluconate,
peak serum levels of quinidine are
achieved in a little less than two hours. This time to peak levels is identical
to the time measured when quinidine salts are administered orally.</p>
<p>The volume of
distribution of quinidine is
typically 2–3 L/kg in healthy young adults, but this may be reduced
to as little as 0.5 L/kg in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>, or increased
to 3–5 L/kg in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. At concentrations
of 2–5 mg/L (6.5–16.2 μmol/L), the fraction of quinidine bound
to plasma proteins (mainly to α<span class="Sub">1</span>–acid glycoprotein
and to albumin) is 80–88% in adults and older children, but it is lower
in pregnant women, and in infants and neonates it may be as low as 50–70%.
Because α<span class="Sub">1</span>–acid glycoprotein levels are increased
in response to stress, serum levels of total quinidine may
be greatly increased in settings such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">acute myocardial infarction</span>, even
though the serum content of unbound (active) drug may remain normal. Protein
binding is also increased in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198185" conceptname="Chronic renal failure">chronic renal failure</span>, but binding abruptly descends
toward or below normal when heparin is administered for hemodialysis.</p>
<p>Quinidine clearance
typically proceeds at 3–5 mL/min/kg in adults, but clearance in pediatric
patients may be twice or three times as rapid. The elimination half–life
is about 6–8 hours in adults and 3–4 hours in pediatric patients. Quinidine clearance
is unaffected by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4064161" conceptname="Cirrhosis of liver">hepatic cirrhosis</span>, so the increased volume of distribution
seen in cirrhosis leads to a proportionate increase in the elimination half–life.</p>
<p>Most quinidine is
eliminated hepatically via the action of cytochrome P450IIIA4; there are several
different hydroxylated metabolites, and some of these have antiarrhythmic
activity.</p>
<p>The most important
of quinidine's
metabolites is 3–hydroxy–quinidine (3HQ),
serum levels of which can approach those of quinidine in
patients receiving conventional doses of quinidine gluconate. The volume of distribution of 3HQ appears to be larger than that of quinidine,
and the elimination half–life of 3HQ is about 12 hours.</p>
<p>As measured by
antiarrhythmic effects in animals, by QT<span class="Sub">c</span> prolongation
in human volunteers, or by various <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> techniques, 3HQ has at least half the
antiarrhythmic activity of the parent compound, so it may be responsible for
a substantial fraction of the effect of quinidine gluconate in chronic use.</p>
<p>When the urine pH is less than 7, about 20% of administered quinidine appears
unchanged in the urine, but this fraction drops to as little as 5% when the
urine is more alkaline. Renal clearance involves both glomerular filtration
and active tubular secretion, moderated by (pH–dependent) tubular reabsorption.
The net renal clearance is about 1 mL/min/kg in healthy adults.</p>
<p>When renal function
is taken into account, quinidine clearance is apparently independent of patient age.</p>
<p>Assays of serum quinidine levels
are widely available, but the results of modern assays may not be consistent
with results cited in the older medical literature. The serum levels of quinidine cited
in this package insert are those derived from specific assays, using either
benzene extraction or (preferably) reverse–phase high–pressure
liquid chromatography. In matched samples, older assays might unpredictably
have given results that were as much as two or three times higher. A typical
"therapeutic" concentration range is 2–6 mg/L (6.2 – 18.5 μmol/L).</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Mechanisms of Action —</span> In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438067" conceptname="Malaria">malaria</span>, quinidine acts
primarily as an intraerythrocytic schizonticide, with little effect upon sporozoites
or upon pre–erythrocytic parasites. Quinidine is gametocidal to <span class="Italics">Plasmodium
vivax</span> and <span class="Italics">P. malariae</span>, but not to <span class="Italics">P.
falciparum</span>.</p>
<p>In cardiac muscle and in Purkinje fibers, quinidine depresses
the rapid inward depolarizing sodium current, thereby slowing phase–0
depolarization and reducing the amplitude of the action potential without
affecting the resting potential. In normal Purkinje fibers, it reduces the
slope of phase–4 depolarization, shifting the threshold voltage upward
toward zero. The result is slowed conduction and reduced automaticity in all
parts of the heart, with increase of the effective refractory period relative
to the duration of the action potential in the atria, ventricles, and Purkinje
tissues. Quinidine also raises the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226399" conceptname="Fibrillation">fibrillation</span> thresholds of the atria and ventricles, and it raises
the ventricular <span class="Italics">de</span><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226399" conceptname="Fibrillation">fibrillation</span> threshold as well. Quinidine's actions <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> into class Ia in the Vaughan–Williams classification.</p>
<p>By slowing conduction and prolonging the effective refractory period, quinidine can
interrupt or prevent reentrant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span> due to increased automaticity, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314665" conceptname="Atrial flutter">atrial flutter</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">atrial fibrillation</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317893" conceptname="Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia">paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia</span>.</p>
<p>In patients with the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317302" conceptname="Sinus node dysfunction">sick sinus syndrome</span>, quinidine can
cause marked sinus node <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>. In most patients, however,
use of quinidine is associated with an increase in sinus rate.</p>
<p>Quinidine prolongs the QT interval in a dose–related fashion. This may lead
to increased ventricular automaticity and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">polymorphic ventricular tachycardias</span>,

<p>In addition, quinidine has anticholinergic activity, it has negative inotropic activity, and it acts
peripherally as an α–adrenergic antagonist (that is, as a vasodilator).</p>

<p class="First">Coadministration of <span class="Bold">propranolol</span> usually

the elimination of <span class="Bold">digoxin</span> and
simultaneously reduces digoxin's apparent volume of distribution. As a result,
serum digoxin levels may be as much as doubled. When quinidine and
digoxin are coadministered, digoxin doses usually need to be reduced. Serum
levels of <span class="Bold">digitoxin</span> are
also raised when quinidine is
coadministered, although the effect appears to be smaller.</p>

<p class="First">Cytochrome P450IID6 is an enzyme critical to the metabolism of many
drugs, notably including <span class="Bold">mexiletine</span>,
some <span class="Bold">phenothiazines</span>,
and most <span class="Bold">polycyclic
antidepressants</span>. Constitutional deficiency of cytochrome P450IID6
is found in less than 1% of Orientals, in about 2% of American blacks, and
in about 8% of American whites. Testing with debrisoquine is sometimes used
to distinguish the P450IID6–deficient "poor metabolizers" from the majority–phenotype
"extensive metabolizers."</p>
<p>When drugs whose metabolism is P450IID6–dependent are given to
poor metabolizers, the serum levels achieved are higher, sometimes much higher,
than the serum levels achieved when identical doses are given to extensive
metabolizers. To obtain similar clinical benefit without toxicity, doses given
to poor metabolizers may need to be greatly reduced. In the cases of prodrugs
whose actions are actually mediated by P450IID6–produced metabolites
(for example, <span class="Bold">codeine</span> and <span class="Bold">hydrocodone</span>, whose
analgesic and antitussive effects appear to be mediated by morphine and hydromorphone,
respectively), it may not be possible to achieve the desired clinical benefits
in poor metabolizers.</p>
<p>Quinidine is
not metabolized by cytochrome P450IID6, but therapeutic serum levels of quinidine inhibit
the action of cytochrome P450IID6, effectively converting extensive metabolizers
into poor metabolizers. Caution must be exercised whenever quinidine is
prescribed together with drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450IID6.</p>

variable slowing of the metabolism of <span class="Bold">nifedipine</span>. Interactions with other dihydropyridine
calcium–channel blockers have not been reported, but these agents (including <span class="Bold">felodipine</span>, <span class="Bold">nicardipine</span>, and <span class="Bold">nimodipine</span>) are all

<p><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">Arrhythmias</span></span> — Serum quinidine levels
can be conveniently assayed and monitored, but the electrocardiographic QT<span class="Sub">c</span> interval
is a better predictor of quinidine–induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span>.</p>
<p>The
necessary treatment of hemodynamically unstable <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">polymorphic ventricular tachycardia</span>
(including <span class="Italics">torsades
de pointes</span>) is withdrawal of treatment with quinidine and
either immediate cardioversion or, if a cardiac pacemaker is in place or immediately
available, immediate overdrive pacing. After pacing or cardioversion, further
management must be guided by the length of the QT<span class="Sub">c</span> interval.</p>
<p>Quinidine–associated
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">ventricular tachyarrhythmias</span> with normal underlying QT<span class="Sub">c</span> intervals
have not been adequately studied. Because of the theoretical possibility of
QT–prolonging effects that might be additive to those of quinidine,
other antiarrhythmics with Class I (disopyramide, procainamide) or Class III
activities should (if possible) be avoided. Similarly, although the use of
bretylium in quinidine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>
has not been reported, it is reasonable to expect that the α–blocking
properties of bretylium might be additive to those of quinidine,
resulting in problematic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>.</p>
<p>If
the post–cardioversion QT<span class="Sub">c</span> interval is prolonged,
then the pre–cardioversion polymorphic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">ventricular tachyarrhythmia</span> was
(by definition) <span class="Italics">torsades
de pointes</span>. In this case, lidocaine and bretylium are unlikely
to be of value, and other Class I antiarrhythmics (disopyramide, procainamide)
are likely to exacerbate the situation. Factors contributing to QT<span class="Sub">c</span> prolongation
(especially <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4098604" conceptname="Hypomagnesemia">hypomagnesemia</span>) should be sought out and (if possible)
aggressively corrected. Prevention of recurrent <span class="Italics">torsades</span> may require sustained overdrive pacing
or the cautious administration of isoproterenol (30–150 ng/kg/min).</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span></span> — Quinidine–induced

of quinidine–related α–blockade and vasorelaxation. Simple repletion of central volume
(Trendelenburg positioning, saline infusion) may be sufficient therapy; other
interventions reported to have been beneficial in this setting are those that
increase peripheral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span>, including α–agonist catecholamines

regimens have each been shown to be effective, with or without concomitant
exchange transfusion. There are no data indicating that either should be preferred
to the other.</p>
<p>In <span class="Bold">Regimen
A</span>, each patient received a <span class="Bold">loading dose</span> of 15 mg/kg of quinidine base
(that is, 24 mg/kg of quinidine gluconate)
in 250 mL of normal saline infused over 4 hours. Thereafter,  each patient received a <span class="Bold">maintenance
regimen</span> of 7.5 mg/kg of base (12 mg/kg of quinidine gluconate) infused over 4 hours every 8 hours, starting 8 hours after the beginning of the loading dose. This regimen was continued for 7 days, except that in patients
able to swallow, the maintenance infusions were discontinued, and approximately
the same daily doses of quinidine were supplied orally, using 300–mg tablets of quinidine sulfate.</p>
<p>In <span class="Bold">Regimen
B</span>, each patient received a <span class="Bold">loading dose</span> of 6.25 mg/kg of quinidine base
(that is, 10 mg/kg of quinidine gluconate) in approximately 5 mL/kg of normal saline over 1–2 hours. Thereafter, each patient received a <span class="Bold">maintenance infusion</span> of 12.5 μg/kg/min of base (that is, 20 μg/kg/min
of quinidine gluconate). In patients able to swallow, the maintenance infusion was discontinued, and eight–hourly oral quinine sulfate was administered to provide approximately as much daily quinine base as the patient had been receiving quinidine base (for example, each adult patient received 650 mg of quinine sulfate every eight hours). Quinidine/quinine therapy was continued for 72 hours or until parasitemia had decreased to 1% or less, whichever came first. After completion of quinidine/quinine
therapy, adults able to swallow received a single 1500–mg/75–mg dose of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (FANSIDAR<span class="Sup">®</span>, Roche Laboratories) or a seven–day course of tetracycline (250 mg four
times daily), while those unable to swallow received seven–day courses
of intravenous doxycycline hyclate (VIBRAMYCIN<span class="Sup">®</span>,
Roerig), 100 mg twice daily. Most of the patients described as having been
treated with this regimen also underwent exchange transfusion. Small children
have received this regimen without dose adjustment and with apparent good
results, notwithstanding the known differences in quinidine pharmacokinetics
between pediatric patients and adults (<span class="Italics">see</span><a href="#s_clinpharm"> Clinical

<p>To prepare quinidine for infusion, the contents of the supplied vial (80 mg/mL) should be diluted
to 50 mL (16 mg/mL) with 5% dextrose. The resulting solution may be stored
for up to 24 hours at room temperature or up to 48 hours at 4°C (40°F).</p>
<p>Because quinidine may be absorbed to PVC tubing, tubing length should be minimized. In one
study <span class="Italics">(Am J Health
Syst Pharm.</span> 1996; 53:655–8), use of 112 inches of tubing
resulted in 30% loss of quinidine, but drug loss was less than 3% when only 12 inches of tubing was used.</p>
<p>An infusion of quinidine must be delivered slowly, preferable under control of a volumetric pump,
no faster than 0.25 mg/kg/min (that is, no faster than 1 mL/kg/hour). During
the first few minutes of the infusion, the patient should be monitored especially
closely for possible hypersensitive or idiosyncratic reactions.</p>
<p>Most <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span> that will respond to intravenous quinidine will
respond to a total dose of less than 5 mg/kg, but some patients may require
as much as 10 mg/kg. If conversion to sinus rhythm has not been achieved after
infusion of 10 mg/kg, then the infusion should be discontinued, and other
means of conversion (<span class="Italics">eg,</span> direct–current cardioversion) should be considered.</p>
