<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">The active ingredient in CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> 1000 mg 
suppositories is mesalamine, also known as mesalazine or 5-aminosalicylic acid 
(5-ASA). Chemically, mesalamine is 5-amino-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, and is 
classified as an anti-inflammatory drug.</p>
<p>The empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">7</span>H<span class="Sub">7</span>NO<span class="Sub">3</span>, representing a molecular weight of 
153.14. The structural formula is:</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Sulfasalazine has been used in the treatment of ulcerative 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4272488" conceptname="Colitis">colitis</span> for over 55 years. It is split by bacterial action in the colon into 
sulfapyridine (SP) and mesalamine (5-ASA). It is thought that the mesalamine 
component only is therapeutically active in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="81893" conceptname="Ulcerative colitis">ulcerative colitis</span>.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Mechanism of Action<p>The mechanism of action of mesalamine (and sulfasalazine) is not 
fully understood, but appears to be topical rather than systemic. Although the 
pathology of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4074815" conceptname="Inflammatory bowel disease">inflammatory bowel disease</span> is uncertain, both prostaglandins and 
leukotrienes have been implicated as mediators of mucosal injury and 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span>. Recently, however, the role of mesalamine as a free radical 
scavenger or inhibitor of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4147451" conceptname="Tumor necrosis">tumor necrosis</span> factor (TNF) has also been 
postulated.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pharmacokinetics<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Absorption:<p>Mesalamine (5-ASA) administered as a rectal suppository is 
variably absorbed. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="81893" conceptname="Ulcerative colitis">ulcerative colitis</span> treated with mesalamine 
500 mg rectal suppositories, administered once every eight hours for six days, 
the mean mesalamine peak plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) was 
353 ng/mL (CV=55%) following the initial dose and 361 ng/mL (CV=67%) at steady 
state. The mean minimum steady state plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">min</span>) was 89 ng/mL (CV=89%). Absorbed mesalamine does not 
accumulate in the plasma.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Distribution:<p>Mesalamine administered as rectal suppositories distributes in 
rectal tissue to some extent. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75580" conceptname="Chronic ulcerative proctitis">ulcerative proctitis</span> treated with 
CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (mesalamine, USP) 1000 mg rectal suppositories, 
rectal tissue concentrations for 5-ASA and N-acetyl-5-ASA have not been 
rigorously quantified.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Metabolism:<p>Mesalamine is extensively metabolized, mainly to N-acetyl-5-ASA. 
The site of metabolism has not been elucidated. In patients with ulcerative 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4272488" conceptname="Colitis">colitis</span> treated with one 500 mg mesalamine rectal suppository every eight hours 
for six days, peak concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of N-acetyl-5-ASA 
ranged from 467 ng/mL to 1399 ng/mL following the initial dose and from 193 
ng/mL to 1304 ng/mL at steady state.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Elimination:<p>Mesalamine is eliminated from plasma mainly by urinary excretion, 
predominantly as N-acetyl-5-ASA. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75580" conceptname="Chronic ulcerative proctitis">ulcerative proctitis</span> treated 
with one mesalamine 500 mg rectal suppository every eight hours for six days, â‰¤ 
12% of the dose was eliminated in urine as unchanged 5-ASA and 8-77% as 
N-acetyl-5-ASA following the initial dose. At steady state, â‰¤ 11% of the dose 
was eliminated as unchanged 5-ASA and 3-35% as N-acetyl-5-ASA. The mean 
elimination half-life was five hours (CV=73%) for 5-ASA and six hours (CV=63%) 
for N-acetyl-5-ASA following the initial dose. At steady state, the mean 
elimination half-life was seven hours for both 5-ASA and N-acetyl-5-ASA (CV=102% 
for 5-ASA and 82% for N-acetyl-5-ASA).</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Drug-Drug Interactions:<p>The potential for interactions between mesalamine, administered 
as 1000 mg rectal suppositories, and other drugs has not been studied.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Special Populations (Patients with Renal or Hepatic 
Impairment):<p>The effect of renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> on elimination of 
mesalamine in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75580" conceptname="Chronic ulcerative proctitis">ulcerative proctitis</span> patients treated with mesalamine 1000 mg 
suppositories has not been studied.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Preclinical Toxicology<p>Preclinical studies of mesalamine were conducted in rats, mice, 
rabbits and dogs, and kidney was the main target organ of toxicity. In rats, 
adverse renal effects were observed at a single oral dose of 600 mg/kg (about 
3.2 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose, based on body surface area) 
and at IV doses of &gt;214 mg/kg (about 1.2 times the recommended human 
intra-rectal dose, based on body surface area). In a 13-week oral gavage 
toxicity study in rats, papillary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280654" conceptname="Necrosis">necrosis</span> and/or multifocal tubular injury were 
observed in males receiving 160 mg/kg (about 0.86 times the recommended human 
intra-rectal dose, based on body surface area) and in both males and females at 
640 mg/kg (about 3.5 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose, based on 
body surface area). In a combined 52-week toxicity and 127-week carcinogenicity 
study in rats, degeneration of the kidneys and hyalinization of basement 
membranes and Bowmanâ€™s capsule were observed at oral doses of 100 mg/kg/day 
(about 0.54 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose, based on body surface 
area) and above. In a 14-day rectal toxicity study of mesalamine suppositories 
in rabbits, intra-rectal doses up to 800 mg/kg (about 8.6 times the recommended 
human intra-rectal dose, based on body surface area) was not associated with any 
adverse effects. In a six-month oral toxicity study in dogs, doses of 80 mg/kg 
(about 1.4 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose, based on body surface 
area) and higher caused renal pathology similar to that described for the rat. 
In a rectal toxicity study of mesalamine suppositories in dogs, a dose of 166.6 
mg/kg (about 3.0 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose, based on body 
surface area) produced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312358" conceptname="Chronic glomerulonephritis">chronic nephritis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198199" conceptname="Pyelonephritis">pyelitis</span>. In the 12-month eye 
toxicity study in dogs, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373204" conceptname="Conjunctival xerosis">Keratoconjunctivitis sicca</span> (KCS) occurred at oral doses 
of 40 mg/kg (about 0.72 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose, based on 
body surface area) and above.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First">Two double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter studies were 
conducted in North America in patients with mild to moderate active ulcerative 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4215578" conceptname="Proctitis">proctitis</span>. The primary measures of efficacy were the same in all trials 
(clinical disease activity index, sigmoidoscopic and histologic evaluations). 
The main difference between the studies was dosage regimen: 500 mg three times 
daily (1.5 g/d) in Study 1; and 500 mg twice daily (1.0 g/d) in Study 2. A total 
of 173 patients were studied (Study 1, N=79; Study 2, N=94). Eighty-nine (89) 
patients received mesalamine suppositories, and eighty-four (84) patients 
received placebo suppositories. Patients were evaluated clinically and 
sigmoidoscopically after three and six weeks of suppository treatment. In Study 
No. 1 patients were 17 to 73 years of age (mean = 39 yrs), 57% were female, and 
97% were white. Patients had an average extent of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4215578" conceptname="Proctitis">proctitis</span> (upper disease 
boundary) of 10.8 cm. Eighty-four percent (84%) of the study patients had 
multiple prior episodes of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4215578" conceptname="Proctitis">proctitis</span>. In Study No. 2, patients were 21 to 72 
years of age (mean = 39 yrs), 62% were female, and 96% were white. Patients had 
an average extent of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4215578" conceptname="Proctitis">proctitis</span> (upper disease boundary) of 10.3 cm. 
Seventy-eight percent (78%) of the study patients had multiple prior episodes of 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4215578" conceptname="Proctitis">proctitis</span>.</p>
<p>Compared to placebo, mesalamine suppository treatment was statistically 
(p less than 0.01) superior to placebo in all trials with respect to improvement in 
stool frequency, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197925" conceptname="Hemorrhage of rectum and anus">rectal bleeding</span>, mucosal appearance, disease severity, and 
overall disease activity after three and six weeks of treatment. Daily diary 
records indicated significant improvement in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197925" conceptname="Hemorrhage of rectum and anus">rectal bleeding</span> in the first week 
of therapy while tenesmus and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span> improved significantly within two weeks. 
Investigators rated patients receiving mesalamine much improved compared to 
patients receiving placebo (p less than 0.001).</p>
<p>The effectiveness of mesalamine suppositories was statistically significant 
irrespective of sex, extent of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4215578" conceptname="Proctitis">proctitis</span>, duration of current episode or 
duration of disease.</p>
<p>A multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group study in ninety-nine 
(99) patients diagnosed with mild to moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75580" conceptname="Chronic ulcerative proctitis">ulcerative proctitis</span> compared the 
clinical efficacy of the CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> 1000 mg suppository to 
that of the CANASA <span class="Sup">Â®</span> 500 mg suppository. The primary 
measures of efficacy included clinical disease activity index, sigmoidoscopic 
and histologic evaluations. Patients were randomized to one of two treatment 
groups, with a dosage regimen of one 500 mg mesalamine suppository BID, morning 
and HS, or one 1000 mg mesalamine suppository HS for 6 weeks. Patients were 
evaluated clinically and sigmoidoscopically after three and six weeks of 
suppository treatment. Of the eighty-one (81) patients in the Per Protocol 
population, forty-six (46) patients received mesalamine 500 mg suppositories 
BID, and thirty-five (35) patients received mesalamine 1000 mg suppositories 
HS.</p>
<p>The efficacy of the 1000 mg HS treatment was not statistically or clinically 
different after 6 weeks from the 500 mg BID treatment, and both were effective 
in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75580" conceptname="Chronic ulcerative proctitis">ulcerative proctitis</span>. Both treatments resulted in a 
significant decrease between Baseline and 6 weeks in the Disease Activity Index 
(DAI), a composite index reflecting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197925" conceptname="Hemorrhage of rectum and anus">rectal bleeding</span>, stool frequency, mucosal 
appearance at endoscopy, and a global assessment of disease. In the 500 mg BID 
group, the mean DAI value decreased from 6.6 to 1.6, and in the 1000 mg HS 
group, the mean DAI value decreased from 6.2 to 1.3 over 6 weeks of treatment, 
representing a decrease of greater than 75% in both groups. Seventy-eight 
percent (78%; 36/46) of patients in the 500 mg BID group and 86% (30/35) of the 
patients in the 1000 mg HS group achieved a substantial improvement in symptoms 
(defined as a DAI score of less than 3) after 6 weeks of treatment. These 
patients regained normal daily stools, lost their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197925" conceptname="Hemorrhage of rectum and anus">rectal bleeding</span>, and lost 
signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> at endoscopic visualization. The time to onset of response 
to the study drug was within 3 weeks of initiation of therapy in each treatment 
group, but further improvement was observed between 3 and 6 weeks of treatment.</p>

<h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h1>
<p class="First">CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> 1000 mg Suppositories are contraindicated in 
patients who have demonstrated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> to mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic 
acid) or to the suppository vehicle [saturated vegetable fatty acid esters (Hard 
Fat, NF)], or to salicylates (including aspirin).</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42232-9">
<a name="section-6"></a><p></p>
<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Mesalamine has been implicated in the production of an acute 
intolerance syndrome characterized by cramping, acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal pain</span> and bloody 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, sometimes <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> and a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>; in such cases prompt withdrawal 
is required. The patientâ€™s history of sulfasalazine intolerance, if any, should 
be re-evaluated. If a rechallenge is performed later in order to validate the 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span>, it should be carried out under close supervision and only if 
clearly needed, giving consideration to reduced dosage. In the literature, one 
patient previously sensitive to sulfasalazine was rechallenged with 400 mg oral 
mesalamine; within eight hours she experienced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, intensive 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal colic</span>, profuse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span> and was readmitted as an emergency. She 
responded poorly to steroid therapy and two weeks later a pancolectomy was 
required. The possibility of increased absorption of mesalamine and concomitant 
renal tubular damage as noted in the preclinical studies must be kept in mind. 
Patients on CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> 1000 mg, especially those on 
concurrent oral products which contain or release mesalamine and those with 
pre-existing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>, should be carefully monitored with urinalysis, BUN 
and creatinine testing.</p>
<p>In a clinical trial most patients who were hypersensitive to sulfasalazine 
were able to take mesalamine enemas without evidence of any <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergic reaction</span>. 
Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when mesalamine is initially used in 
patients known to be allergic to sulfasalazine. These patients should be 
instructed to discontinue therapy if signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span> become apparent.</p>
<p>A small proportion of patients have developed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4272488" conceptname="Colitis">pancolitis</span> while using 
mesalamine. However, extension of upper disease boundary and/or flare-ups 
occurred less often in the mesalamine-treated group than in the placebo-treated 
group.</p>
<p>Rare instances of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4138837" conceptname="Pericarditis">pericarditis</span> have been reported with mesalamine containing 
products including sulfasalazine. Cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4138837" conceptname="Pericarditis">pericarditis</span> have also been reported 
as manifestations of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4074815" conceptname="Inflammatory bowel disease">inflammatory bowel disease</span>. In the cases reported there 
have been positive rechallenges with mesalamine or mesalamine containing 
products. In one of these cases, however, a second rechallenge with 
sulfasalazine was negative throughout a 2 month follow-up. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77670" conceptname="Chest pain">Chest pain</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">dyspnea</span> 
in patients treated with mesalamine should be investigated with this information 
in mind. Discontinuation of CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> suppositories may be 
warranted in some cases, but rechallenge with mesalamine can be performed under 
careful clinical observation should the continued therapeutic need for 
mesalamine be present.</p>
<p>There have been two reports in the literature of additional serious adverse 
events: one patient who developed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435224" conceptname="Leukopenia">leukopenia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span> after seven 
months of treatment with one 500 mg suppository nightly, and one patient with 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span> which was a similar reaction to sulfasalazine.</p>

end of this insert.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of 
Fertility<p>Mesalamine caused no increase in the incidence of neoplastic 
lesions over controls in a two-year study of Wistar rats fed up to 320 mg/kg/day 
of mesalamine admixed with diet (about 1.7 times the recommended human 
intra-rectal dose, based on body surface area).</p>
<p>Mesalamine was not mutagenic in the Ames test, the mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> cell 
(TK<span class="Sup">Â±</span>) forward mutation test, or the mouse micronucleus 
test.</p>
<p>No effects on fertility or reproductive performance of the male and female 
rats were observed at oral mesalamine doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times 
the recommended human intra-rectal dose, based on body surface area). The 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4339289" conceptname="Oligozoospermia">oligospermia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4035976" conceptname="Sterility">infertility</span> in men associated with sulfasalazine have not been 
reported with mesalamine.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pregnancy<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Teratogenic Effects, Pregnancy Category B<p>Teratology studies have been performed in rats at oral doses up 
to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose, based 
on body surface area) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 495 mg/kg/day (about 
5.4 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose, based on body surface area) 
and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to 
mesalamine. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in 
pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of 
human response, this drug should be used in pregnancy only if clearly 
needed.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Nursing Mothers<p>It is not known whether mesalamine or its metabolite(s) are 
excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution 
should be exercised when CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> 1000 mg suppositories 
are administered to a nursing woman.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pediatric Use<p>Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been 
established.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Geriatric Use<p>Clinical studies of CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> did not 
include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether 
they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical 
experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and 
younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be 
cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or 
cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>
<p>Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk 
of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal 
function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal 
function, it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p>

<p>In the multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group study comparing 
the CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> 1000 mg suppository (HS) to that of the 
CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> 500 mg suppository (BID), there were no 
differences between the two treatment groups in the adverse event profile. The 
most frequent AEs were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> (14.4%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012503" conceptname="Excessive upper gastrointestinal gas">flatulence</span> (5.2%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal pain</span>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">The usual dosage of CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (mesalamine, 
USP) 1000 mg suppositories is one rectal suppository 1 time daily at 
bedtime.</p>
<p>The suppository should be retained for one to three hours or longer, if 
possible, to achieve the maximum benefit. While the effect of CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> suppositories may be seen within three to twenty-one days, 
the usual course of therapy would be from three to six weeks depending on 
symptoms and sigmoidoscopic findings. Studies have suggested that CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> suppositories will delay relapse after the six-week 
short-term treatment.</p>

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>What is CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span>?<p>CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (can-AH-sah) is a medicine used to 
treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75580" conceptname="Chronic ulcerative proctitis">ulcerative proctitis</span> (ulcerative rectal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4272488" conceptname="Colitis">colitis</span>). CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> works inside your rectum (lower intestine) to help reduce 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, mucous and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4318833" conceptname="Hemorrhagic diarrhea">bloody diarrhea</span> caused by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span> and 
soreness) of the rectal area. You use CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> by 
inserting it into your rectum.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Who should not use CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span>?<p>Do not use CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> if you are allergic to 
the active ingredient mesalamine (also found in drugs such as Rowasa, Asacol, 
Pentasa, Azulfidine, and Dipentum), if you are allergic to the inactive 
ingredients, or if you have had any unusual reaction to the ingredients.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have kidney problems. Using CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> may make them 
worse.</li>
<li>Have had inflamed pancreas (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192640" conceptname="Pancreatitis">pancreatitis</span>).</li>
<li>Are pregnant. You and your doctor will decide if you should use CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span>.</li>

<li>Are allergic to aspirin.</li>
<li>Are allergic to other things, such as foods, preservatives, or

</ul>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>How should I use CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span>?<p>Follow your doctorâ€™s instructions about how often to use 
CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> and how long to use it. For the 1000 mg 
suppository, the usual dose is one suppository at bedtime for 3-6 weeks. We do 
not know if CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> will work for children or is safe for 
them.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to use CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span>:</p>
<ol>
<li>For best results, empty your rectum (have a bowel movement) just before 
using CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span>.</li>
<li>Detach one CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> suppository from the strip of 
suppositories.</li>
<li>Hold the suppository upright and carefully peel open the plastic at the 
pre-cut line to take out the suppository.</li>
<li>Insert the suppository with the pointed end first completely into your 
rectum, using gentle pressure.</li>
<li>For best results, keep the suppository in your rectum for 3 hours or longer, 
if possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have trouble inserting CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span>, you may put a 
little bit of lubricating gel on the suppository.</p>
<p>Do not handle the suppository too much, since it may begin to melt from the 
heat from your hands and body.</p>
<p>If you miss a dose of CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span>, use it as soon as 
possible, unless it is almost time for next dose. Do not use two CANASA<span class="Sup">Â® </span>suppositories at the same time to make up for a missed 
dose.</p>
<p>Keep using CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> as long as your doctor tells you to 
use it, even if you feel better.</p>
<p>CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> can cause stains on things it touches. 
Therefore keep it away from clothing and other fabrics, flooring, painted 
surfaces, marble, granite, plastics, andenamel. Be careful since CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> may stain clothing.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>What should I avoid while taking CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span>?<p>Do not breast feed while using CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span>. We 
do not know if CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> can pass through the milk and harm 
the baby. Tell your doctor if you become pregnant while using CANASA<span class="Sup">Â®</span>.</p>
