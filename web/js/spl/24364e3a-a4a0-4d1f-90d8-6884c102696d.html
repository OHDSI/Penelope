<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Carisoprodol:</span> The mechanism of action of carisoprodol in relieving <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090431" conceptname="Discomfort">discomfort</span> associated with acute painful musculoskeletal conditions has not been clearly identified. In animal studies, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">muscle relaxation</span> induced by carisoprodol is associated with altered interneuronal activity in the spinal cord and in the descending reticular formation of the brain.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Aspirin:</span> The mechanism of action of aspirin in relieving <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> is by inhibition of the body’s production of prostaglandins, which are thought to cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> sensations by stimulating muscle contractions and dilating blood vessels.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Codeine Phosphate:</span> The precise mechanism of action of codeine phosphate, an opioid agonist, in relieving <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> has not been established. The binding of codeine phosphate to mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) may change the perception of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>. The analgesic activity of codeine phosphate is probably due to its conversion to morphine.</p>

<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Carisoprodol:</span> Carisoprodol is a centrally-acting muscle relaxant that does not directly relax <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4136244" conceptname="Feeling tense">tense</span> skeletal muscles. A metabolite of carisoprodol, meprobamate, has anxiolytic and sedative properties. The degree to which these properties of meprobamate contribute to the safety and efficacy of Carisoprodol, Aspirin and Codeine Phosphate is unknown.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Aspirin:</span> Aspirin is a non-narcotic analgesic with anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretic activity. Inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis appears to account for most of its anti-inflammatory and for at least part of its analgesic and antipyretic properties. In the CNS, aspirin works on the hypothalamus heat-regulating center to reduce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>. Aspirin can cause serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168618" conceptname="Injury of gastrointestinal tract">gastrointestinal injury</span> including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, obstruction, and perforations from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcers</span> possibly by inhibition of the production of prostaglandins, compromising the defenses of the gastric mucosa and the activity of substances involved in tissue repair and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcer</span> healing (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#warnings">WARNINGS</a></span>). Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversibly inhibiting prostaglandin cyclo-oxygenase. This effect lasts for the life of the platelet and prevents the formation of the platelet aggregating factor thromboxane A2. </p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Codeine Phosphate:</span> Codeine phosphate is a centrally-acting narcotic analgesic. Its actions are qualitatively similar to morphine, but its potency is substantially less. Opioids, including codeine phosphate have the following effects:</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Carisoprodol:</span> The pharmacokinetics of carisoprodol and its metabolite meprobamate were studied in a study of 24 healthy subjects (12 male and 12 female) who received single doses of 350 mg of carisoprodol (see Table 1). The Cmax of meprobamate was 2.5 ± 0.5 µg/mL (mean ± SD) after administration of a single 350 mg dose of carisoprodol, which is approximately 30% of the Cmax of meprobamate (approximately 8 µg/mL) after administration of a single 400 mg dose of meprobamate.</p>

<p><span class="Italics">Absorption:</span> Absolute bioavailability of carisoprodol has not been determined. After administration of a single dose of 350 mg of carisoprodol, the mean time to peak plasma concentrations (Tmax) of carisoprodol was approximately 1.5 to 2 hours. Co-administration of a high-fat meal with 350 mg of carisoprodol had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of carisoprodol.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Metabolism:</span> The major pathway of carisoprodol metabolism is via the liver by cytochrome enzyme CYP2C19 to form meprobamate. This enzyme exhibits genetic polymorphism (see Patients with Reduced CYP2C19 Activity below).</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Elimination:</span> Carisoprodol is eliminated by both renal and non-renal routes with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 2 hours after administration of a single dose of 350 mg of carisoprodol. The half-life of meprobamate is approximately 10 hours after administration of a single dose of 350 mg of carisoprodol.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Gender:</span> Exposure of carisoprodol is higher in females than in male subjects (approximately 30 to 50% on a weight adjusted basis). Overall exposure of meprobamate is comparable between female and male subjects.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Patients with Reduced CYP2C19 Activity:</span> Carisoprodol should be used with caution in patients with reduced CYP2C19 activity. Published studies indicate that patients who are poor CYP2C19 metabolizers have a 4-fold increase in exposure to carisoprodol, and 50% reduced exposure to meprobamate compared to normal CYP2C19 metabolizers. The prevalence of poor metabolizers in Caucasians and African Americans is approximately 3 to 5% and in Asians is approximately 15 to 20%.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Aspirin: </span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Absorption:</span>  The rate of aspirin absorption from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is dependent upon the presence or absence of food, gastric pH (the presence or absence of GI antacids), and other physiologic factors. Following absorption, aspirin is hydrolyzed to salicylic acid in the gut wall and during first-pass metabolism with peak plasma levels of salicylic acid occurring within 1 to 2 hours of dosing. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Distribution:</span> Salicylic acid is widely distributed to all tissues and fluids in the body including the central nervous system (CNS), breast milk, and fetal tissues. The highest concentrations are found in the plasma, liver, kidneys, heart, and lungs. The protein binding of salicylate is concentration dependent, i.e., nonlinear. At plasma concentrations of salicylic acid &lt; 100 µg/mL and &gt; 400 µg/mL, approximately 90 and 76 percent of plasma salicylate is bound to albumin, respectively. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Metabolism:</span> Aspirin, which has a half-life of about 15 minutes, is hydrolyzed in the plasma to salicylic acid such that plasma levels of aspirin may not be detectable 1 to 2 hours after dosing. Salicylic acid, which has a plasma half-life of approximately 6 hours, is conjugated in the liver to form salicyluric acid, salicyl phenolic glucuronide, salicyl acyl glucuronide, gentisic acid, and gentisuric acid. At higher serum concentrations of salicylic acid, the total clearance of salicylic acid decreases due to the limited ability of the liver to form both salicyluric acid and phenolic glucuronide. Following toxic doses of aspirin (e.g., &gt; 10 grams), the plasma half-life of salicylic acid may be increased to over 20 hours.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Elimination:</span> The elimination of salicylic acid is constant in relation to the plasma salicylic acid concentration. Following therapeutic doses of aspirin, approximately 75, 10, 10, and 5 percent is found excreted in the urine as salicyluric acid, salicylic acid, a phenolic glucuronide of salicylic acid, and an acyl glucuronide of salicylic acid, respectively. As the urinary pH rises above 6.5, the renal clearance of free salicylate increases from less than 5 percent to greater than 80 percent. Alkalinization of the urine is a key concept in the management of salicylate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#overdosage-treatmentofoverdosage">OVERDOSAGE, Treatment of Overdosage</a></span>). Clearance of salicylic acid is also reduced in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Codeine Phosphate:</span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Absorption:</span> Codeine is readily absorbed from the GI tract. At therapeutic doses, the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span> reaches a peak within 2 hours and persists between 4 and 6 hours.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Distribution:</span> Codeine is rapidly distributed from the intravascular spaces to the tissues with preferential uptake by the liver, spleen, and kidney. Codeine crosses the blood-brain barrier, and is found in fetal tissue and breast milk. The plasma concentration of codeine does not correlate with brain concentration of codeine or the relief of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Metabolism:</span> The plasma half-life of codeine is about 2.9 hours.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Elimination:</span> The elimination of codeine is primarily via the kidneys, and about 90% of an oral dose is excreted by the kidneys within 24 hours of dosing. The urinary secretion products consist of free and glucuronide-conjugated codeine (about 70%), free and conjugated norcodeine (about 10%), free and conjugated morphine (about 10%), normorphine (4%), and hydrocodone (1%). The remainder of the dose is excreted in the feces.</p>

Concomitant use of carisoprodol and meprobamate, a metabolite of carisoprodol, is not recommended (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#warnings-sedation">WARNINGS, Sedation</a></span>). Carisoprodol is metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 to form meprobamate (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#clinicalpharmacology">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span>). Co-administration of CYP2C19 inhibitors, such as omeprazole or fluvoxamine, with carisoprodol could result in increased exposure of carisoprodol and decreased exposure of meprobamate. Co-administration of CYP2C19 inducers, such as rifampin or St. John’s Wort, with carisoprodol could result in decreased exposure of carisoprodol and increased exposure of meprobamate. Low dose aspirin also showed an induction effect of CYP2C19. The full pharmacological impact of these potential alterations of exposures in terms of either efficacy or safety of carisoprodol is unknown.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Aspirin:</span> Clinically important interactions may occur when certain drugs or alcohol are administered concomitantly with aspirin.</p>

<p><span class="Italics">Corticosteroids:</span> Concomitant administration of aspirin and corticosteroids may decrease salicylate plasma levels.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Methotrexate:</span> Aspirin may enhance the toxicity of methotrexate due to displacement of methotrexate from its plasma protein binding sites and/or reduction of the renal clearance of methotrexate. </p>

Carisoprodol, Aspirin and Codeine Phosphate should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Carisoprodol:</span> There are no data on the use of carisoprodol during human pregnancy. Animal studies indicate that carisoprodol crosses the placenta and results in adverse effects on fetal growth and postnatal survival.

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Carisoprodol:</span> Very limited data in humans show that carisoprodol is present in breast milk and may reach concentrations two to four times the maternal plasma concentrations. In one case report, a breast-fed infant received about 4 to 6% of the maternal daily dose though breast milk and experienced no adverse effects. However, milk production was inadequate and the baby was supplemented with formula. In lactation studies in mice, female pup survival and pup weight at weaning was decreased. This information suggests that maternal use of carisoprodol may lead to reduced or less effective infant feeding (due to sedation) and/or decreased milk production. Caution should be exercised when carisoprodol is administered to a nursing woman.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Aspirin:</span> Nursing mothers should avoid the use of aspirin because salicylate is excreted in breast milk, which may lead to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> in the infant.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Codeine Phosphate:</span>  Codeine is secreted into human milk. In women with normal codeine metabolism (normal CYP2D6 activity), the amount of codeine secreted into human milk is low. Despite the common use of codeine products to manage postpartum <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, reports of codeine-associated adverse reactions in nursing infants are rare. Nursing mothers who are ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine have higher-than-expected levels of morphine (the active metabolite of codeine) in their blood, leading to higher levels of morphine in their breast milk and potentially dangerously high serum morphine levels in their breastfed infants. Therefore, in nursing mothers who are ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine, the maternal use of codeine can lead to serious adverse reactions, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>; in their nursing infants and in the nursing mothers (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#precautions-ultra">PRECAUTIONS, Ultra-rapid Metabolizers of Codeine</a></span>).</p>
<p>Prior to prescribing nursing mothers codeine phosphate, the risk of infant exposure to codeine and morphine through breast milk should be weighed against the benefits of breastfeeding for both the mother and the infant. If a codeine-containing product is selected, the lowest dose should be prescribed for the shortest period of time to achieve the desired clinical effect. Prescribers should closely monitor mother-infant pairs and notify treating pediatricians about the use of codeine during breastfeeding.</p>

<p><span class="Bold Italics">Codeine Phosphate:</span> After a severe opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, primary attention should be given to the need for re-establishment of a patent airway and institution of assisted ventilation.

Before attempting treatment by gastric emptying or activated charcoal, care should be taken to secure the airway. Pure opioid antagonist (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene) are specific antidotes to severe respiratory and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span> resulting from opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. If the response to these opioid antagonists is sub-optimal, additional antagonist should be administered.
