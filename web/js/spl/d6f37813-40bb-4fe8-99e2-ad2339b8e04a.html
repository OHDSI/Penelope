<h1>1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Azor is indicated for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, alone or with
other antihypertensive agents  , to lower blood pressure.
Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal
cardiovascular events, primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">strokes</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarctions</span>.
These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of
antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes
including the class to which this drug principally belongs. There are
no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with Azor. 
</p>
<p> Control of high blood pressure should be part of
comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as
appropriate, lipid control, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> management, antithrombotic
therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many
patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure
goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published
guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure
Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention,
Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). 
</p>
<p> Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of
pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have
been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood
pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the
drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest
and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a
reduction in the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, but reductions in myocardial
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4206471" conceptname="Infarct">infarction</span> and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen
regularly. 
</p>
<p> Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased
cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is
greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of
severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk
reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations
with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in
patients who are at higher risk independent of their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>
(for example, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432867" conceptname="Hyperlipidemia">hyperlipidemia</span>), and such
patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment
to a lower blood pressure goal. 
</p>
<p> Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure
effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive
drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on
angina, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, or diabetic kidney disease). These
considerations may guide selection of therapy. 
</p>
<p>Azor may also be used as initial therapy in patients who are
likely to need multiple antihypertensive agents to achieve their
blood pressure goals.</p>
<p>Patients with moderate or severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> are at relatively
high risk for cardiovascular events (such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">strokes</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">heart attacks</span>,
and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">kidney failure</span>, and vision problems, so prompt
treatment is clinically relevant. The decision to use a combination
as initial therapy should be individualized and should be shaped by
considerations such as baseline blood pressure, the target goal, and
the incremental likelihood of achieving goal with a combination
compared to monotherapy. Individual blood pressure goals may vary
based upon the patient’s risk.</p>
<p>Data from an 8-week, placebo-controlled, parallel-group factorial
study [see <a href="#a30ad6a0-705c-11dc-b50e-0002a5d5c51b">Clinical
Studies (14.1)</a>] provide estimates of the probability of reaching
a blood pressure goal with Azor compared to amlodipine or olmesartan
medoxomil monotherapy. The figures below provide estimates of the
likelihood of achieving the targeted systolic or diastolic blood
pressure goals with Azor 10/40 mg compared with amlodipine or
olmesartan medoxomil monotherapy, based upon baseline systolic or
diastolic blood pressure. The curve of each treatment group was
estimated by logistic regression modeling from all available data of
that treatment group. The right tail of each curve is less reliable
because of small numbers of subjects with high baseline blood
pressures.</p>

<br><p><span class="Bold">Figure 4: Probability of Achieving Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP)
&lt;80 mmHg at Week 8 With LOCF</span></p>
<p>The figures above provide an approximation of the likelihood of
reaching a targeted blood pressure goal (e.g., Week 8 SBP &lt;140
mmHg or &lt;130 mmHg or a DBP &lt;90 mmHg or &lt;80 mmHg) for the
high-dose treatment groups evaluated in the study. Azor 5/20 mg, the
lowest dose combination treatment group, increases the probability of
reaching blood pressure goal compared with the highest dose
monotherapies, amlodipine 10 mg and olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg.</p>
<p> For example, a patient with a baseline blood pressure of
160/100 mmHg has about a 48% likelihood of achieving a goal of &lt;140
mmHg (systolic) and a 51% likelihood of achieving a goal of &lt;90
mmHg (diastolic) on monotherapy with olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg, and
about a 46% likelihood of achieving a goal of &lt;140 mmHg (systolic)
and a 60% likelihood of achieving a goal of &lt;90 mmHg (diastolic)
on monotherapy with amlodipine 10 mg. The likelihood of achieving
these same goals increases to 63% (systolic) and 71% (diastolic) on
Azor 5/20 mg, and to 68% (systolic) and 85% (diastolic) on Azor 10/40
mg.</p>

<a name="section-5.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>5.1 Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality</h2>
<p class="First"><span>Olmesartan medoxomil</span>. Drugs that 
act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause fetal and neonatal 
morbidity and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> when administered to pregnant women. There have been several 
dozen cases reported in the world literature of patients who were taking 
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. When pregnancy is detected, 
discontinue Azor as soon as possible.</p>
<p>During the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, these drugs have been 
associated with fetal injury that includes <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, neonatal skull 
hypoplasia, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090272" conceptname="Anuria">anuria</span>, reversible or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198185" conceptname="Chronic renal failure">irreversible renal failure</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">Oligohydramnios</span> has also been reported, presumably resulting from decreased 
fetal renal function; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> in this setting has been associated with 
fetal limb <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208264" conceptname="Muscle contracture">contractures</span>, craniofacial deformation, and hypoplastic lung 
development. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439128" conceptname="Extreme immaturity">Prematurity</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80204" conceptname="Fetal growth restriction">intrauterine growth retardation</span>, and patent ductus 
arteriosus have also been reported, although it is not clear whether these 
occurrences were due to exposure to the drug.</p>
<p>These adverse effects do not appear to have resulted from intrauterine drug 
exposure that has been limited to the first trimester. Mothers whose embryos and 
fetuses are exposed to an angiotensin II receptor antagonist only during the 
first trimester should be so informed. Nonetheless, when patients become 
pregnant, physicians should have the patient discontinue the use of Azor as soon 
as possible.</p>
<p>Rarely (probably less often than once in every thousand pregnancies), no 
alternative to a drug acting on the renin-angiotensin system will be found. In 
these rare cases, the mothers should be apprised of the potential hazards to 
their fetuses and serial ultrasound examinations should be performed to assess 
the intra-amniotic environment.</p>
<p>If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> is observed, discontinue Azor unless it is considered 
life-saving for the mother. Contraction stress testing (CST), a non-stress test 
(NST), or biophysical profiling (BPP) may be appropriate, depending upon the 
week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible 
injury.</p>
<p>Infants with histories of <span class="Italics">in utero</span> exposure to an 
angiotensin II receptor antagonist should be closely observed for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306451" conceptname="Oliguria">oliguria</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span>. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306451" conceptname="Oliguria">oliguria</span> occurs, attention should be directed 
toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusion or 
dialysis may be required as means of reversing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> and/or substituting 
for disordered renal function.</p>
<p>No teratogenic effects were observed when olmesartan medoxomil was 
administered to pregnant rats at oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (240 times the 
maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) 
or pregnant rabbits at oral doses up to 1 mg/kg/day (half the MRHD on a 
mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis; higher doses could not be evaluated for 
effects on fetal development as they were lethal to the does). In rats, 
significant decreases in pup birth weight and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span> were observed at doses 
≥1.6 mg/kg/day, and delays in developmental milestones (delayed separation of 
ear auricular, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">eruption</span> of lower incisors, appearance of abdominal hair, descent 
of testes, and separation of eyelids) and dose-dependent increases in the 
incidence of dilation of the renal pelvis were observed at doses ≥8 mg/kg/day. 
The no observed effect dose for developmental toxicity in rats is 0.3 mg/kg/day, 
about one-tenth the MRHD of 40 mg/day.</p>

medoxomil. Patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- 
and/or salt-depleted patients (e.g., those being treated with high doses of 
diuretics) may be particularly vulnerable. Initiate treatment with Azor under 
close medical supervision. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> does occur, place the patient in the 
supine position and, if necessary, give an intravenous infusion of normal

<p>The overall incidence of adverse reactions on therapy with Azor was similar 
to that seen with corresponding doses of the individual components of Azor, and 
to placebo. The reported adverse reactions were generally mild and seldom led to 
discontinuation of treatment (2.6% for Azor and 6.8% for placebo).</p>

cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the 
greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of 
concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Elderly patients have decreased 
clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase of AUC of approximately 40% to 
60%, and a lower initial dose may be required.</p>

<h2>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First"><span>Azor.</span> Azor is a combination of two 
antihypertensive drugs: a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion 
antagonist or slow-channel blocker), amlodipine besylate, and an angiotensin II 
receptor blocker, olmesartan medoxomil. The amlodipine component of Azor 
inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle 
and cardiac muscle, and the olmesartan medoxomil component of Azor blocks the 
vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p><span>Amlodipine.</span> Experimental data 
suggests that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nonhydropyridine 
binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth 
muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these 
cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx 
across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth 
muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be 
detected <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> but such effects have not been seen 
in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Serum calcium concentration is not 
affected by amlodipine. Within the physiologic pH range, amlodipine is an 
ionized compound (pKa=8.6), and its kinetic interaction with the calcium channel 
receptor is characterized by a gradual rate of association and dissociation with 
the receptor binding site, resulting in a gradual onset of effect.</p>
<p>Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on 
vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span> 
and reduction in blood pressure.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p><span>Olmesartan medoxomil.</span> Angiotensin 
II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin 
converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor 
agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137788" conceptname="Vascular constriction">vasoconstriction</span>, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac 
stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the 
vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of 
angiotensin II to the AT<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor in vascular smooth 
muscle. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II 
synthesis.</p>
<p>An AT<span class="Sub">2</span> receptor is found also in many tissues, but 
this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. 
Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor than for the AT<span class="Sub">2</span> 
receptor.</p>
<p>Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit 
the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is a mechanism of many 
drugs used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of 
bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because olmesartan does not 
inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. 
Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known.</p>
<p>Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory 
feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased 
plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the 
effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.</p>

<a name="section-11.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>12.2 Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First"><span>Amlodipine.</span> Following 
administration of therapeutic doses to patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, amlodipine 
produces vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood 
pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a 
significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic 
dosing.</p>
<p>With chronic once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness 
is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect 
in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure 
with amlodipine is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation; 
thus, individuals with moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> (diastolic pressure 105-114 mmHg) 
had about a 50% greater response than patients with mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> (diastolic 
pressure 90-104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically 
significant change in blood pressures (+1/-2 mmHg).</p>
<p>In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of 
amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span> and an increase 
in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow without change in 
filtration fraction or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75650" conceptname="Proteinuria">proteinuria</span>.</p>
<p>As with other calcium channel blockers, hemodynamic measurements of cardiac 
function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal 
ventricular function treated with amlodipine have generally demonstrated a small 
increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208254" conceptname="Cardiac index">cardiac index</span> without significant influence on dP/dt or on left 
ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In hemodynamic studies, amlodipine 
has not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in 
the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and man, even when co-administered 
with beta-blockers to man. Similar findings, however, have been observed in 
normals or well-compensated patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> with agents possessing 
significant negative inotropic effects.</p>
<p>Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular 
conduction in intact animals or man. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was 
administered in combination with beta-blockers to patients with either 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters 
were observed.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p><span>Olmesartan medoxomil.</span> Olmesartan 
medoxomil doses of 2.5 mg to 40 mg inhibit the pressor effects of angiotensin I 
infusion. The duration of the inhibitory effect was related to dose, with doses 
of olmesartan medoxomil &gt;40 mg giving &gt;90% inhibition at 24 hours.</p>
<p>Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II and plasma renin 
activity (PRA) increase after single and repeated administration of olmesartan 
medoxomil to healthy subjects and hypertensive patients. Repeated administration 
of up to 80 mg olmesartan medoxomil had minimal influence on aldosterone levels 
and no effect on serum potassium.</p>

<h2>12.3 Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine and olmesartan medoxomil from 
Azor are equivalent to the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine and olmesartan 
medoxomil when administered separately. The bioavailability of both components 
is well below 100%, but neither component is affected by food. The effective 
half-lives of amlodipine (45±11 hours) and olmesartan (7±1 hours) result in a 2- 
to 3- fold accumulation for amlodipine and negligible accumulation for 
olmesartan with once-daily dosing.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p><span>Amlodipine.</span> After oral 
administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine, absorption produces peak 
plasma concentrations between 6 and 12 hours. Absolute bioavailability is 
estimated as between 64% and 90%.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p><span>Olmesartan medoxomil.</span> Olmesartan 
medoxomil is rapidly and completely bioactivated by ester hydrolysis to 
olmesartan during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. The absolute 
bioavailability of olmesartan medoxomil is approximately 26%. After oral 
administration, the peak plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of 
olmesartan is reached after 1 to 2 hours. Food does not affect the 
bioavailability of olmesartan medoxomil.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p><br><br><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p><span>Amlodipine.</span><span class="Italics"> Ex 
vivo</span> studies have shown that approximately 93% of the circulating drug is 
bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients. Steady-state plasma levels of 
amlodipine are reached after 7 to 8 days of consecutive daily dosing.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p><span>Olmesartan medoxomil.</span> The volume 
of distribution of olmesartan is approximately 17 L. Olmesartan is highly bound 
to plasma proteins (99%) and does not penetrate red blood cells. The protein 
binding is constant at plasma olmesartan concentrations well above the range 
achieved with recommended doses.</p>
<p>In rats, olmesartan crossed the blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all. 
Olmesartan passed across the placental barrier in rats and was distributed to 
the fetus. Olmesartan was distributed to milk at low levels in rats.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p><br><br><span class="Bold">Metabolism and Excretion</span></p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p><span>Amlodipine.</span> Amlodipine is 
extensively (about 90%) converted to inactive metabolites via hepatic 
metabolism. Elimination from the plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination 
half-life of about 30 to 50 hours. Ten percent of the parent compound and 60% of 
the metabolites are excreted in the urine.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p><span>Olmesartan medoxomil.</span> Following 
the rapid and complete conversion of olmesartan medoxomil to olmesartan during 
absorption, there is virtually no further metabolism of olmesartan. Total plasma 
clearance of olmesartan is 1.3 L/h, with a renal clearance of 0.6 L/h. 
Approximately 35% to 50% of the absorbed dose is recovered in urine while the 
remainder is eliminated in feces via the bile.</p>
<p>Olmesartan appears to be eliminated in a biphasic manner with a terminal 
elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours. Olmesartan shows linear 
pharmacokinetics following single oral doses of up to 320 mg and multiple oral 
doses of up to 80 mg. Steady-state levels of olmesartan are achieved within 3 to 
5 days and no accumulation in plasma occurs with once-daily dosing.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p><br><br><span class="Bold">Geriatric</span></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetic properties of Azor in the elderly are similar to those of 
the individual components.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p><span>Amlodipine.</span> Elderly patients have 
decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase in AUC of 
approximately 40% to 60%, and a lower initial dose may be required.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p><span>Olmesartan medoxomil.</span> The 
pharmacokinetics of olmesartan medoxomil were studied in the elderly (<span class="Underline">&gt;</span>65 
years). Overall, maximum plasma concentrations of olmesartan were similar in 
young adults and the elderly. Modest accumulation of olmesartan was observed in 
the elderly with repeated dosing; AUC<span class="Sub">ѕѕ</span>, <span class="Sub">τ</span> was 33% higher in elderly patients, corresponding to an 
approximate 30% reduction in CL<span class="Sub">R</span>.</p>

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p><span>Amlodipine.</span> Sixty-two hypertensive 
patients aged 6 to 17 years received doses of amlodipine between 1.25 mg and 20 
mg. Weight-adjusted clearance and volume of distribution were similar to values 
in adults.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p><span>Olmesartan medoxomil.</span> The 
pharmacokinetics of olmesartan medoxomil have not been investigated in patients 
&lt;18 years of age.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p><br><br><span class="Bold">Gender</span></p>
<p>Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that female patients had 
approximately 15% smaller clearances of olmesartan than male patients. Gender 
had no effect on the clearance of amlodipine.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p><span>Olmesartan medoxomil.</span> Minor 
differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of olmesartan medoxomil in 
women compared to men. AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> were 10% to 15% 
higher in women than in men.</p>

<h2>13.1  Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First"><span>Amlodipine.</span> Rats and mice treated 
with amlodipine maleate in the diet for up to two years, at concentrations 
calculated to provide daily dosage levels of amlodipine 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 
mg/kg/day showed no evidence of a carcinogenic effect of the drug. For the 
mouse, the highest dose was, on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, similar to 
the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of amlodipine 10 mg/day. For the rat, 
the highest dose was, on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, about two and a 
half times the MRHD. (Calculations based on a 60 kg patient.)</p>
<p>Mutagenicity studies conducted with amlodipine maleate revealed no drug 
related effects at either the gene or chromosome level.</p>
<p>There was no effect on the fertility of rats treated orally with amlodipine 
maleate (males for 64 days and females for 14 days prior to mating) at doses of 
amlodipine up to 10 mg/kg/day (about 10 times the MRHD of 10 mg/day on a 
mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><p><span>Olmesartan medoxomil.</span> Olmesartan 
was not carcinogenic when administered by dietary administration to rats for up 
to 2 years. The highest dose tested (2000 mg/kg/day) was, on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, about 480 times the maximum recommended human dose 
(MRHD) of 40 mg/day. Two carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice, a 6-month 
gavage study in the p53 knockout mouse and a 6-month dietary administration 
study in the Hras2 transgenic mouse, at doses of up to 1000 mg/kg/day (about 120 
times the MRHD), revealed no evidence of a carcinogenic effect of olmesartan. 
Both olmesartan medoxomil and olmesartan tested negative in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> Syrian hamster embryo cell transformation assay 
and showed no evidence of genetic toxicity in the Ames (bacterial mutagenicity) 
test. However, both were shown to induce chromosomal aberrations in cultured 
cells <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> (Chinese hamster lung) and tested 
positive for thymidine kinase mutations in the <span class="Italics">in 
vitro</span> mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> assay. Olmesartan medoxomil tested negative <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> for mutations in the MutaMouse intestine and kidney 
and for clastogenicity in mouse bone marrow (micronucleus test) at oral doses of 
up to 2000 mg/kg (olmesartan not tested).</p>
<p>Fertility of rats was unaffected by administration of olmesartan at dose 
levels as high as 1000 mg/kg/day (240 times the MRHD) in a study in which dosing 
was begun 2 (female) or 9 (male) weeks prior to mating.</p>

<p>The antihypertensive effect of Azor was similar in patients with and without

patients <span class="Underline">&gt;</span>65 years of age and &lt;65 years of age, and in women and men. Limited 
data exist in patients <span class="Underline">&gt;</span>75 years of age.</p>
<p>Azor was effective in treating black patients (usually a low-renin 
population), and the magnitude of blood pressure reduction in black patients 
approached that observed for non-Black patients. This effect in black patients 
has been seen with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and 
beta-blockers.</p>
<p>The blood pressure lowering effect was maintained throughout the 24-hour 
period with Azor once daily, with trough-to-peak ratios for systolic and 
diastolic response between 71% and 82%.</p>
<p>Upon completing the 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 1684 
patients entered a 44-week open-label extension and received combination therapy 
with amlodipine 5 mg plus olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg. During the open-label 
extension, patients whose blood pressure was not adequately controlled (i.e.,

<h2>14.3 Olmesartan Medoxomil</h2>
<p class="First">The antihypertensive effects of olmesartan medoxomil have been 
demonstrated in seven placebo-controlled studies at doses ranging from 2.5 mg to 
80 mg for 6 to 12 weeks, each showing statistically significant reductions in 
peak and trough blood pressure. A total of 2693 patients (2145 olmesartan 
medoxomil; 548 placebo) with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320128" conceptname="Essential hypertension">essential hypertension</span> were studied. The blood 
pressure lowering effect was maintained throughout the 24-hour period with 
olmesartan medoxomil once daily, with trough-to-peak ratios for systolic and 
diastolic response between 60% and 80%.</p>

<p class="First">Physicians should instruct female patients of childbearing age 
about the consequences of second and third trimester exposure to drugs that act 
on the renin-angiotensin system and they should be told that these consequences

limited to the first trimester. These patients should be informed to report 
pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible. [See <span class="Italics"><a href="#a7a554a0-7034-11dc-95c5-0002a5d5c51b">Warnings and Precautions
