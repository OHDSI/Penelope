<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">RENOVA<span class="Sup">®</span> (tretinoin cream) 0.02% contains the active ingredient tretinoin in a cream base. Tretinoin is a yellow- to light-orange crystalline powder having a characteristic floral odor. Tretinoin is soluble in dimethylsulfoxide, slightly soluble in polyethylene glycol 400, octanol, and 100% ethanol. It is practically insoluble in water and mineral oil, and it is insoluble in glycerin. The chemical name for tretinoin is (all-E)-3,7-dimethyl-9-(2,6,6-trimethyl-1-cyclohexen-1-yl)-2,4,6,8-nonatetraenoic acid. Tretinoin is also referred to as all-trans-retinoic acid and has a molecular weight of 300.44. The structural formula is represented below.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Tretinoin is an endogenous retinoid metabolite of Vitamin A that binds to intracellular receptors in the cytosol and nucleus, but cutaneous levels of tretinoin in excess of physiologic concentrations occur following application of a tretinoin-containing topical drug product. Although tretinoin activates three members of the retinoic acid (RAR) nuclear receptors (RARα, RARβ, and RARγ) which may act to modify gene expression, subsequent protein synthesis, and epithelial cell growth and differentiation, it has not been established whether the clinical effects of tretinoin are mediated through activation of retinoic acid receptors, other mechanisms such as irritation, or both.</p>
<p>The effect of tretinoin on skin with chronic photodamage has not been evaluated in animal studies. When hairless albino mice were treated topically with tretinoin shortly after a period of UVB irradiation, new collagen formation was demonstrated only in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185267" conceptname="Solar degeneration">photodamaged skin</span>. However, in human skin treated topically, adequate data have not been provided to demonstrate any increase in desmosine, hydroxyproline, or elastin mRNA. Application of 0.1% tretinoin cream to photodamaged human forearm skin was associated with an increase in antibody staining for procollagen I propeptide. No correlation was made between procollagen I propeptide staining with collagen I levels or with observed clinical effects. Thus, the relationships between the increased collagen in rodents, increased procollagen I propeptide in humans, and the clinical effects of tretinoin have not yet been clearly defined.</p>
<p>Tretinoin was shown to enhance UV-stimulated melanogenesis in pigmented mice. Generalized amyloid deposition in the basal layer of tretinoin-treated skin was noted in a two-year mouse study. In a different study, hyalinization at tretinoin-treated skin sites was noted at doses beginning at 0.25 mg/kg in CD-1 mice.</p>
<p>The transdermal absorption of tretinoin from various topical formulations ranged from 1% to 31% of applied dose, depending on whether it was applied to healthy skin or dermatitic skin. No percutaneous absorption study was conducted with RENOVA<span class="Sup">®</span> (tretinoin cream) 0.02% in human volunteers. When percutaneous absorption of the oil-in-water emulsion formulation at 0.05% concentration was assessed in healthy male subjects with radiolabeled cream after a single application (n=7), as well as after repeated daily applications (n=7) for 28 days, the absorption of tretinoin was less than 2% and the extent of bioavailability was less after repeated application. No significant difference in endogenous concentrations of tretinoin was observed between single and repeated daily applications.</p>

<h2>CLINICAL TRIALS</h2>
<p class="First">Four adequate and well-controlled multi-center trials and one single-center randomized, controlled trial were conducted involving a total of 324 evaluable patients treated with RENOVA<span class="Sup">®</span> (tretinoin cream) 0.02% and 332 evaluable patients treated with the vehicle cream on the face for 24 weeks with a comprehensive skin care and sun avoidance program, to assess the effects on fine and coarse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkling</span>, mottled hyperpigmentation, tactile skin roughness, and laxity.  Patients were evaluated at baseline on a 10 unit scale and changes from the baseline rating were categorized as follows:</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4034142" conceptname="Papilloma">papillomas</span> in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. These concentrations are near the tretinoin concentration of this clinical formulation (0.02%). A dose-related incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322895" conceptname="Nodule of liver">liver tumors</span> in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day. These doses are 10 and 20 times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span> of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.5 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.02% RENOVA<span class="Sup">®</span> (tretinoin cream) 0.02% applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.004 mg tretinoin/kg body weight).</p>
<p>Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4083855" conceptname="Abnormal pigment">pigmentation</span> did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources.</p>
<p>The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative.</p>
<p>In dermal Segment I fertility studies in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (10 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with RENOVA<span class="Sup">®</span> (tretinoin cream) 0.02% has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245750" conceptname="Growth retardation">growth retardation</span> were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (83 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area).</p>

<h4>Pregnancy Category C</h4>
<p class="First"><span class="Underline">ORAL tretinoin</span> has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, rabbits, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (42 times the maximum human systemic dose normalized for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which, metabolically, is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079975" conceptname="Congenital malformation">fetal malformations</span> were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (417 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported.  Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">TOPICAL tretinoin</span> in animal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> (shorted or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (42 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was dermally applied.</p>
<p>There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (17 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4043738" conceptname="Hydrocephalus">hydrocephaly</span>, typical of retinoid-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079975" conceptname="Congenital malformation">fetal malformations</span> in this species.</p>
<p>In contrast, several well-controlled animal studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overtly teratogenic, in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (42 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species).</p>
<p>With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally-associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of another formulation of topical tretinoin (Retin-A). Although no definite pattern of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> and no causal association has been established from these cases, 5 of the reports describe the rare birth defect category <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4149584" conceptname="Holoprosencephaly sequence">holoprosencephaly</span> (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known.</p>

<p>Dermal tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (42 times the maximum human systemic dose normalized for total body surface area).

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">(See <span class="Bold"><a href="#WARNINGS">WARNINGS</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#PRECAUTIONS">PRECAUTIONS</a></span> sections.)</p>
<p>In double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies involving 339 patients who applied RENOVA<span class="Sup">®</span> (tretinoin cream) 0.02% to their faces, adverse reactions associated with the use of RENOVA<span class="Sup">®</span> (tretinoin cream) 0.02% were limited primarily to the skin. Almost all patients reported one or more local reactions such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4032013" conceptname="Desquamation">peeling</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4039266" conceptname="Dry skin">dry skin</span>, burning, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">stinging</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span>. In 32% of all study patients, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280604" conceptname="Skin irritation">skin irritation</span> was reported that was severe, led to temporary discontinuation of RENOVA<span class="Sup">®</span> (tretinoin cream) 0.02%, or led to the use of a mild topical corticosteroid. About 7% of patients using RENOVA<span class="Sup">®</span> (tretinoin cream) 0.02%, compared to less than 1% of the control patients, had sufficiently severe local irritation to warrant short-term use of mild topical corticosteroids to alleviate local irritation. About 4% of patients had to discontinue use of RENOVA<span class="Sup">®</span> (tretinoin cream) 0.02% because of adverse reactions.</p>
<p>Approximately 2% of spontaneous post-marketing adverse even reporting for RENOVA<span class="Sup">®</span> (tretinoin cream) 0.05% were for skin hypo- or hyperpigmentation. Other spontaneously reported adverse events for RENOVA<span class="Sup">®</span> (tretinoin cream) 0.05% predominantly appear to be local reactions similar to those seen in clinical trials.</p>
