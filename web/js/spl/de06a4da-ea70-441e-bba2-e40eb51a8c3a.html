<h1>DESCRIPTION:</h1>
<p class="First">Nitroglycerin, an organic nitrate, is a vasodilator which has effects on both arteries and veins. The chemical name for nitroglycerin is 1,2,3-propanetriol trinitrate (C<span class="Sub">3</span>H<span class="Sub">5</span>N<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">9</span>). The compound has a molecular weight of 227.09. The chemical structure is:<br> <br><img alt="Image from Drug Label Content" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=de06a4da-ea70-441e-bba2-e40eb51a8c3a&amp;name=Nitrolingual-Pumpspray-figure-2.jpg"><br> <br>Nitrolingual<span class="Sup">®</span> Pumpspray (nitroglycerin lingual spray 400 mcg) is a metered dose spray containing nitroglycerin. This product delivers nitroglycerin (400 mcg per spray, 60 or 200 metered sprays) in the form of spray droplets onto or under the tongue. Inactive ingredients: medium-chain triglycerides, dehydrated alcohol, medium-chain partial glycerides, peppermint oil.<br></p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: </h1>
<p class="First">The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, producing a vasodilator effect on both peripheral arteries and veins with more prominent effects on the latter. Dilation of the post-capillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (pre-load). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span> and arterial pressure (after-load). <br><br>The mechanism by which nitroglycerin relieves <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321318" conceptname="Angina pectoris">angina pectoris</span> is not fully understood. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4200706" conceptname="Tension">tension</span>-time index, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>-work index) is decreased by both the arterial and venous effects of nitroglycerin and presumably, a more favorable supply-demand ratio is achieved. <br><br>While the large epicardial coronary arteries are also dilated by nitroglycerin, the extent to which this action contributes to relief of exertional angina is unclear. <br>Nitroglycerin is rapidly metabolized <span class="Italics">in vivo</span>, with a liver reductase enzyme having primary importance in the formation of glycerol nitrate metabolites and inorganic nitrate. Two active major metabolites, 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerols, the products of hydrolysis, although less potent as vasodilators, have longer plasma half-lives than the parent compound. The dinitrates are further metabolized to mononitrates (considered biologically inactive with respect to cardiovascular effects) and ultimately glycerol and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135927" conceptname="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</span>. <br>Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falls</span> excessively or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. <br>Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, pulmonary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span> and systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span> are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably a reflex response to the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314171" conceptname="Low blood pressure reading">fall in blood pressure</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208254" conceptname="Cardiac index">Cardiac index</span> may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressure and systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span> values in conjunction with a depressed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208254" conceptname="Cardiac index">cardiac index</span> are likely to experience an improvement in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208254" conceptname="Cardiac index">cardiac index</span>. On the other hand, when filling pressures and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208254" conceptname="Cardiac index">cardiac index</span> are normal, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208254" conceptname="Cardiac index">cardiac index</span> may be slightly reduced.<br>In a pharmacokinetic study when a single 0.8 mg dose of Nitrolingual<span class="Sup">®</span> Pumpspray was administered to healthy volunteers (n = 24), the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and t<span class="Sub">max</span> were 1,041pg/mL • min and 7.5 minutes, respectively. Additionally, in these subjects the mean area-under-the-curve (AUC) was 12,769 pg/mL • min. <br>In a randomized, double-blind single-dose, 5-period cross-over study in 51 patients with exertional <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321318" conceptname="Angina pectoris">angina pectoris</span> significant dose-related increases in exercise tolerance, time to onset of angina and ST-segment <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> were seen following doses of 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 mg of nitroglycerin delivered by metered pumpspray as compared to placebo.<br>Additionally the drug was well tolerated as evidenced by a profile of generally mild to moderate adverse events.<br></p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, particularly with upright posture, may occur even with small doses of nitroglycerin. The drug, therefore, should be used with caution in subjects who may have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436375" conceptname="Hypovolemia">volume depletion</span> from diuretic therapy or in patients who have low systolic blood pressure (e.g., below 90 mm Hg).

Tolerance to the vascular and anti-anginal effects of nitrates has been demonstrated in clinical trials, experience through occupational exposure, and in isolated tissue experiments in the laboratory.<br> <br>In industrial workers continuously exposed to nitroglycerin, tolerance clearly occurs. Moreover, physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> also occurs since <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77670" conceptname="Chest pain">chest pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">acute myocardial infarction</span>, and even <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4132309" conceptname="Sudden death">sudden death</span> have occurred during temporary withdrawal of nitroglycerin from the workers. In various clinical trials in angina patients, there are reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321318" conceptname="Angina pectoris">anginal attacks</span> being more easily provoked and of rebound in the hemodynamic effects soon after nitrate withdrawal. The relative importance of these observations to the routine, clinical use of nitroglycerin is not known.<br></p>

<h1>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: </h1>
<p class="First">Animal carcinogenesis studies with sublingual nitroglycerin have not been performed. <br> <br>Rats receiving up to 434 mg/kg/day of dietary nitroglycerin for 2 years developed dose-related fibrotic and neoplastic changes in liver, including carcinomas, and interstitial cell tumors in testes. At high dose, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in both sexes were 52% vs. 0% in controls, and incidences of testicular tumors were 52% vs. 8% in controls. Lifetime dietary administration of up to 1058 mg/kg/day of nitroglycerin was not tumorigenic in mice.<br> <br>Nitroglycerin was weakly mutagenic in Ames tests performed in two different laboratories. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> dominant lethal assay with male rats treated with doses up to about 363 mg/kg/day, p.o., or in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> cytogenic tests in rat and dog tissues.<br> <br>In a three-generation reproduction study, rats received dietary nitroglycerin at doses up to about 434 mg/kg/day for six months prior to mating of the F<span class="Sub">0</span> generation with treatment continuing through successive F<span class="Sub">1</span> and F<span class="Sub">2</span> generations. The high dose was associated with decreased feed intake and body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span> in both sexes at all matings. No specific effect on the fertility of the F<span class="Sub">0</span> generation was seen. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4035976" conceptname="Sterility">Infertility</span> noted in subsequent generations, however, was attributed to increased interstitial cell tissue and aspermatogenesis in the high-dose males.

<p class="First">Case reports of clinically significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">methemoglobinemia</span> are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin.<br></p>

<h2>Treatment of Overdosage:</h2>
<p class="First">Keep the patient recumbent in a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span> position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">methemoglobinemia</span> is present, administration of methylene blue (1% solution), 1-2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required. If an excessive quantity of Nitrolingual<span class="Sup">®</span> Pumpspray has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use.<br></p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</h1>
<p class="First">At the onset of an attack, one or two metered sprays should be administered onto or under the tongue. No more than three metered sprays are recommended within a 15-minute period. If the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77670" conceptname="Chest pain">chest pain</span> persists, prompt medical attention is recommended. Nitrolingual<span class="Sup">®</span> Pumpspray may be used prophylactically five to ten minutes prior to engaging in activities which might precipitate an acute attack.<br> <br>Each metered spray of Nitrolingual<span class="Sup">®</span> Pumpspray delivers 48 mg of solution containing 400 mcg of nitroglycerin after an initial priming of 5 sprays. It will remain adequately primed for 6 weeks.If the product is not used within 6 weeks it can be adequately reprimed with 1 spray. Longer storage periods without use may require up to 5 repriming sprays. There are 60 or 200 metered sprays per bottle. The total number of available doses is dependent, however, on the number of sprays per use (1 or 2 sprays), and the frequency of repriming.<br> <br>The transparent container can be used for continuous monitoring of the consumption. <span class="Bold">The end of the pump should be covered by the fluid level</span>. Once fluid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falls</span> below the level of the center tube, sprays will not be adequate and the container should be replaced. As with all other sprays, there is a residual volume of fluid at the bottom of the bottle which cannot be used. <br> <br>During application the patient should rest, ideally in the sitting position. The container should be held vertically with the valve head uppermost and the spray orifice as close to the mouth as possible. The dose should preferably be sprayed onto the tongue by pressing the button firmly and the mouth should be closed immediately after each dose. THE SPRAY SHOULD NOT BE INHALED. The medication should not be expectorated or the mouth rinsed for 5 to 10 minutes following administration. Patients should be instructed to familiarize themselves with the position of the spray orifice, which can be identified by the finger rest on top of the valve, in order to facilitate orientation for administration at night.<br></p>
