<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">The barbiturates are nonselective central nervous system (CNS) depressants that are primarily used as sedative-hypnotics. In subhypnotic doses, they are also used as anticonvulsants. The barbiturates and their sodium salts are subject to control under the Federal Controlled Substances Act.</p>
<p>Phenobarbital is a barbituric acid derivative and occurs as white, odorless, small crystals or crystalline powder that is very slightly soluble in water; soluble in alcohol, in ether, and in solutions of fixed alkali hydroxides and carbonates; sparingly soluble in chloroform. Phenobarbital is 5-ethyl-5-phenylbarbituric acid and has the empirical formula C<span class="Sub">12</span>H<span class="Sub">12</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">3</span>. Its molecular weight is 232.24. It has the following structural formula:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="This is the structural formula for Phenobarbital Elixir, USP." src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=ff602c63-870a-4a32-b14e-27dbfb34151f&amp;name=phenoelixir-1.jpg"></div>
<p>Phenobarbital is a substituted pyrimidine derivative in which the basic structure is barbituric acid, a substance that has no CNS activity. CNS activity is obtained by substituting alkyl, alkenyl, or aryl groups on the pyrimidine ring.</p>
<p>Each 5 mL (teaspoonful) contains 20.0 mg phenobarbital. The elixir also contains FD&amp;C Red #40, flavors, glycerin, purified water, sucrose, and alcohol 15%.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Barbiturates are capable of producing all levels of CNS mood alteration, from excitation to mild sedation, hypnosis, and deep <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>. Overdosage can produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. In high enough therapeutic doses, barbiturates induce anesthesia.</p>
<p>Barbiturates depress the sensory cortex, decrease motor activity, alter cerebellar function, and produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, sedation, and hypnosis.</p>
<p>Barbiturate-induced sleep differs from physiologic sleep. Sleep laboratory studies have demonstrated that barbiturates reduce the amount of time spent in the rapid eye movement (REM) phase of sleep or the dreaming stage. Also, Stages III and IV sleep are decreased. Following abrupt cessation of barbiturates used regularly, patients may experience markedly increased dreaming, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4009184" conceptname="Dream anxiety disorder">nightmares</span>, and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>. Therefore, withdrawal of a single therapeutic dose over 5 or 6 days has been recommended to lessen the REM rebound and disturbed sleep that contribute to the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441260" conceptname="Drug withdrawal">drug withdrawal syndrome</span> (for example, the dose should be decreased from 3 to 2 doses/day for 1 week).</p>
<p>In studies, secobarbital sodium and pentobarbital sodium have been found to lose most of their effectiveness for both inducing and maintaining sleep by the end of 2 weeks of continued drug administration even with the use of multiple doses. As with secobarbital sodium and pentobarbital sodium, other barbiturates (including amobarbital) might be expected to lose their effectiveness for inducing and maintaining sleep after about 2 weeks. The short-, intermediate-, and to a lesser degree, long-acting barbiturates have been widely prescribed for treating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>. Although the clinical literature abounds with claims that the short-acting barbiturates are superior for producing sleep whereas the intermediate-acting compounds are more effective in maintaining sleep, controlled studies have failed to demonstrate these differential effects. Therefore, as sleep medications, the barbiturates are of limited value beyond short-term use.</p>
<p>Barbiturates have little analgesic action at subanesthetic doses. Rather, in subanesthetic doses, these drugs may increase the reaction to painful stimuli. All barbiturates exhibit anticonvulsant activity in anesthetic doses. However, of the drugs in this class, only phenobarbital, mephobarbital, and metharbital are effective as oral anticonvulsants in subhypnotic doses.</p>
<p>Barbiturates are respiratory depressants, and the degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> is dependent upon the dose. With hypnotic doses, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> produced by barbiturates is similar to that which occurs during physiologic sleep and is accompanied by a slight decrease in blood pressure and heart rate.</p>
<p>Studies in laboratory animals have shown that barbiturates cause reduction in the tone and contractility of the uterus, ureters, and urinary bladder. However, concentrations of the drugs required to produce this effect in humans are not reached with sedative-hypnotic doses.</p>
<p>Barbiturates do not impair the normal hepatic function but have been shown to induce liver microsomal enzymes, thus increasing and/or altering the metabolism of barbiturates and other drugs (<span class="Italics">see </span><a href="#LINK_35b3388e-1d84-4abd-ba06-47ae218f0427">Drug Interactions</a> <span class="Italics">under</span> PRECAUTIONS).</p>

<h3><span class="Italics">Pharmacokinetics</span></h3>
<p class="First">Barbiturates are absorbed in varying degrees following oral or parenteral administration. The salts are more rapidly absorbed than are the acids. The rate of absorption is increased if the sodium salt is ingested as a dilute solution or taken on an empty stomach.</p>
<p>Duration of action, which is related to the rate at which the barbiturates are redistributed throughout the body, varies among persons and in the same person from time to time.</p>
<p>Phenobarbital is classified as a long-acting barbiturate when taken orally. Its onset of action is 1 hour or longer, and its duration of action ranges from 10 to 12 hours.</p>
<p>Barbiturates are weak acids that are absorbed and rapidly distributed to all tissues and fluids, with high concentrations in the brain, liver, and kidneys. Lipid solubility of the barbiturates is the dominant factor in their distribution within the body. The more lipid soluble the barbiturate, the more rapidly it penetrates all tissues of the body. Barbiturates are bound to plasma and tissue proteins to a varying degree with the degree of binding increasing directly as a function of lipid solubility.</p>
<p>Phenobarbital has the lowest lipid solubility, lowest plasma binding, lowest brain protein binding, the longest delay in onset of activity, and the longest duration of action. The plasma half-life for phenobarbital in adults ranges between 53 and 118 hours with a mean of 79 hours. The plasma half-life for phenobarbital in children and newborns (less than 48 hours old) ranges between 60 to 180 hours with a mean of 110 hours.</p>
<p>Barbiturates are metabolized primarily by the hepatic microsomal enzyme system, and the metabolic products are excreted in the urine, and, less commonly, in the feces. Approximately 25% to 50% of a dose of phenobarbital is eliminated unchanged in the urine. The excretion of unmetabolized barbiturate is one feature that distinguishes the long-acting category from those belonging to other categories, which are almost entirely metabolized. The inactive metabolites of the barbiturates are excreted as conjugates of glucuronic acid.</p>

<p class="First">The following information and instructions should be given to patients receiving barbiturates.</p>
<ol class="Arabic">
<li>The use of barbiturates carries with it an associated risk of psychological and/or physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>.

<h3><span class="Italics">Laboratory Tests</span></h3>
<p class="First">Prolonged therapy with barbiturates should be accompanied by periodic laboratory evaluation of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic systems (<span class="Italics">see</span> <a href="#LINK_311d3bf3-c470-4e2b-b9ae-80df349b9f2c">General</a> <span class="Italics">under</span> PRECAUTIONS and <a href="#LINK_6fe9071f-b806-4a91-8d04-78c16f115dd3">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="Italics">Drug Interactions</span></h3>
<p class="First">Most reports of clinically significant drug interactions occurring with the barbiturates have involved phenobarbital. However, the application of this data to other barbiturates appears valid and warrants serial blood level determinations of the relevant drugs when there are multiple therapies.</p>
<ol class="Arabic">
<li>
<span class="Italics">Anticoagulants</span>–Phenobarbital lowers the plasma levels of dicumarol and causes a decrease in anticoagulant activity as measured by the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time. Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon). Patients stabilized on anticoagulant therapy may require dosage adjustments if barbiturates are added to or withdrawn from their dosage regimen.</li>
<li>
<span class="Italics">Corticosteroids</span>–Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids, probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes. Patients stabilized on corticosteroid therapy may require dosage adjustments if barbiturates are added to or withdrawn from their dosage regimen.</li>
<li>
<span class="Italics">Griseofulvin</span>–Phenobarbital appears to interfere with the absorption of orally administered griseofulvin, thus decreasing its blood level. The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established. However, it would be preferable to avoid concomitant administration of these drugs.</li>
<li>
<span class="Italics">Doxycycline</span>–Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued. This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic. If phenobarbital and doxycycline are administered concurrently, the clinical response to doxycycline should be monitored closely.</li>
<li>
<span class="Italics">Phenytoin, Sodium Valproate, Valproic Acid</span>–The effect of barbiturates on the metabolism of phenytoin appears to be variable. Some investigators report an accelerating effect, whereas others report no effect. Because the effect of barbiturates on the metabolism of phenytoin is not predictable, phenytoin and barbiturate blood levels should be monitored more frequently if these drugs are given concurrently. Sodium valproate and valproic acid increase the phenobarbital serum levels; therefore, phenobarbital blood levels should be closely monitored and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.</li>
<li>
<span class="Italics">CNS Depressants</span>–The concomitant use of other CNS depressants, including other sedatives or hypnotics, antihistamines, tranquilizers, or alcohol, may produce additive depressant effects.</li>
<li>
<span class="Italics">Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)</span>–MAOIs prolong the effects of barbiturates, probably because metabolism of the barbiturate is inhibited.</li>
<li>
<span class="Italics">Estradiol, Estrone, Progesterone, and other Steroidal Hormones</span>–Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism. There have been reports of patients treated with antiepileptic drugs (e.g., phenobarbital) who become pregnant while taking oral contraceptives. An alternate contraceptive method might be suggested to women taking phenobarbital.</li>

<h1>DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></h1>
<p class="First">Controlled Substance–Phenobarbital is a Schedule IV drug.</p>
<p>Dependence–Barbiturates may be habit forming. Tolerance, psychological <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>, and physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> may occur, especially following prolonged use of high doses of barbiturates. Daily administrations in excess of 400 mg of pentobarbital or secobarbital for approximately 90 days is likely to produce some degree of physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>. A dosage of 600 to 800 mg taken for at least 35 days is sufficient to produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218977" conceptname="Drug withdrawal seizure">withdrawal seizures</span>. The average daily dose for the barbiturate addict is usually about 1.5 g. As tolerance to barbiturates develops, the amount needed to maintain the same level of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> increases; tolerance to a fatal dosage, however, does not increase more than twofold. As this occurs, the margin between intoxicating dosage and fatal dosage becomes smaller.</p>
<p>Symptoms of acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> with barbiturates include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437643" conceptname="Abnormal gait">unsteady gait</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196636" conceptname="Dysarthria">slurred speech</span>, and sustained <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378165" conceptname="Nystagmus">nystagmus</span>. Mental signs of chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, poor judgment, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, and somatic complaints.</p>
<p>Symptoms of barbiturate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> are similar to those of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435243" conceptname="Alcohol dependence">chronic alcoholism</span>. If an individual appears to be intoxicated with alcohol to a degree that is radically disproportionate to the amount of alcohol in his or her blood, the use of barbiturates should be suspected. The lethal dose of a barbiturate is far less if alcohol is also ingested.</p>
<p>The symptoms of barbiturate withdrawal can be severe and may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. Minor withdrawal symptoms may appear 8 to 12 hours after the last dose of a barbiturate. These symptoms usually appear in the following order: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4247265" conceptname="Muscle twitch">muscle twitching</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span> of hands and fingers, progressive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">weakness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, distortion in visual perception, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span>. Major withdrawal symptoms (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373995" conceptname="Delirium">delirium</span>) may occur within 16 hours and last up to 5 days after abrupt cessation of barbiturates. The intensity of withdrawal symptoms gradually declines over a period of approximately 15 days. Individuals susceptible to barbiturate abuse and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> include alcoholics and opiate abusers as well as other sedative-hypnotic and amphetamine abusers.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug dependence</span> on barbiturates arises from repeated administration of a barbiturate or agent with barbiturate-like effect on a continuous basis, generally in amounts exceeding therapeutic dose levels. The characteristics of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">drug dependence</span> on barbiturates include: (a) a strong desire or need to continue taking the drug; (b) a tendency to increase the dose; (c) a psychic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> on the effects of the drug related to subjective and individual appreciation of those effects; and (d) a physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> on the effects of the drug, requiring its presence for maintenance of homeostasis and resulting in a definite, characteristic and self-limited abstinence syndrome when the drug is withdrawn.</p>
<p>Treatment of barbiturate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> consists of cautious and gradual withdrawal of the drug. Barbiturate-dependent patients can be withdrawn by using a number of different withdrawal regimens. In all cases, withdrawal requires an extended period of time. One method involves substituting a 30-mg dose of phenobarbital for each 100- to 200-mg dose of barbiturate that the patient has been taking. The total daily amount of phenobarbital is then administered in 3 or 4 divided doses, not to exceed 600 mg daily. If signs of withdrawal occur on the first day of treatment, a loading dose of 100 to 200 mg of phenobarbital may be administered IM in addition to the oral dose. After stabilization on phenobarbital, the total daily dose is decreased by 30 mg/day as long as withdrawal is proceeding smoothly. A modification of this regimen involves initiating treatment at the patient’s regular dosage level and decreasing the daily dosage by 10% if tolerated by the patient.</p>
<p>Infants who are physically dependent on barbiturates may be given phenobarbital, 3 to 10 mg/kg/day. After withdrawal symptoms (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">hyperactivity</span>, disturbed sleep, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremors</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4313132" conceptname="Hyperreflexia">hyperreflexia</span>) are relieved, the dosage of phenobarbital should be gradually decreased and completely withdrawn over a 2-week period.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Signs and Symptoms</span>–The onset of symptoms following a toxic oral exposure to phenobarbital may not occur until several hours following ingestion. The toxic dose of barbiturates varies considerably. In general, an oral dose of 1 g of most barbiturates produces serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">poisoning</span> in an adult. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Death</span> commonly occurs after 2 to 10 g of ingested barbiturate. The sedated, therapeutic blood levels of phenobarbital range between 5 to 40 mcg/mL; the usual lethal blood level ranges from 100 to 200 mcg/mL. Barbiturate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> may be <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confused</span> with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218106" conceptname="Alcoholism">alcoholism</span>, bromide <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>, and various neurologic disorders. Potential tolerance must be considered when evaluating significance of dose and plasma concentration.</p>
<p>The manifestations of a long-acting barbiturate in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378165" conceptname="Nystagmus">nystagmus</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437584" conceptname="Ataxia">ataxia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435371" conceptname="Hypothermia">hypothermia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>. Other findings may include absent or depressed reflexes and erythematous or hemorrhagic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443720" conceptname="Blister">blisters</span> (primarily at pressure points). Following massive exposure to phenobarbital, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4078925" conceptname="Pulmonary edema">pulmonary edema</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">circulatory collapse</span> with loss of peripheral vascular tone, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> may occur.</p>
<p>In extreme <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, all electrical activity in the brain may cease, in which case a "flat" EEG normally equated with clinical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> should not be accepted. This effect is fully reversible unless <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxic</span> damage occurs.</p>
<p>Consideration should be given to the possibility of barbiturate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> even in situations that appear to involve <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433633" conceptname="Late effect of superficial injury">trauma</span>.</p>

<p><span class="Italics">Treatment</span>–To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, a good resource is your certified Regional Poison Control Center. Telephone numbers of certified poison control centers are listed in the <span class="Italics">Physicians’ Desk Reference</span> (PDR). In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">multiple drug overdoses</span>, interaction among drugs, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient.</p>
<p>Protect the patient’s airway and support ventilation and perfusion. Meticulously monitor and maintain, within acceptable limits, the patient’s vital signs, blood gases, serum electrolytes, etc. Absorption of drugs from the gastrointestinal tract may be decreased by giving activated charcoal, which, in many cases, is more effective than <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> or lavage; consider charcoal instead of or in addition to gastric emptying. Repeated doses of charcoal over time may hasten elimination of some drugs that have been absorbed. Safeguard the patient’s airway when employing gastric emptying or charcoal.</p>
<p>Alkalinization of urine hastens phenobarbital excretion, but dialysis and hemoperfusion are more effective and cause less troublesome alterations in electrolyte equilibrium. If the patient has chronically abused sedatives, withdrawal reactions may be manifest following <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">acute overdose</span>.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">The dose of phenobarbital must be individualized with full knowledge of its particular characteristics. Factors of consideration are the patient’s age, weight, and condition.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Sedation</span>: For sedation, the drug may be administered in single doses of 30 to 120 mg repeated at intervals; frequency will be determined by the patient’s response. It is generally considered that no more than 400 mg of phenobarbital should be administered during a 24-hour period.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Adults</span>: Daytime Sedation: 30 to 120 mg daily in 2 to 3 divided doses.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Oral Hypnotic</span>: 100 to 200 mg</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Anticonvulsant Use</span>–Clinical laboratory reference values should be used to determine the therapeutic anticonvulsant level of phenobarbital in the serum. To achieve the blood levels considered therapeutic in pediatric patients, higher per-kilogram dosages are generally necessary for phenobarbital and most other anticonvulsants. In pediatric patients and infants, phenobarbital at a loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg produces blood levels of about 20 mcg/mL shortly after administration.</p>
<p>Phenobarbital has been used in the treatment and prophylaxis of febrile <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>. However, it has not been established that prevention of febrile <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> influences the subsequent development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>.</p>
