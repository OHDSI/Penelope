<h2>5.1 Exacerbation of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">Hepatitis</span> after Discontinuation of Treatment</h2>
<p class="First">Severe acute exacerbation of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> has been reported in patients who have discontinued anti-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> B therapy, including therapy with Adefovir Dipivoxil Tablets. Hepatic function should be monitored at repeated intervals with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who discontinue Adefovir Dipivoxil Tablets. If appropriate, resumption of anti-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> B therapy may be warranted.</p>
<p>In clinical trials of Adefovir Dipivoxil Tablets, exacerbations of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> (ALT elevations 10 times the upper limit of normal or greater) occurred in up to 25% of patients after discontinuation of Adefovir Dipivoxil Tablets. These events were identified in studies GS-98-437 and GS-98-438 (N=492). Most of these events occurred within 12 weeks of drug discontinuation. These exacerbations generally occurred in the absence of HBeAg seroconversion, and presented as serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of viral replication. In the HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative studies in patients with compensated liver function, the exacerbations were not generally accompanied by hepatic decompensation. However, patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis may be at higher risk for hepatic decompensation. Although most events appear to have been self-limited or resolved with re-initiation of treatment, severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> exacerbations, including fatalities, have been reported. Therefore, patients should be closely monitored after stopping treatment.</p>

<p>Changes in renal function occurred in pre-and post-liver transplantation patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction, including concomitant use of cyclosporine and tacrolimus, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> at baseline, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, and on-study transplantation. Therefore, the contributory role of Adefovir Dipivoxil Tablets to these changes in renal function is difficult to assess. </p>
<p>Increases in serum creatinine greater than or equal to 0.3 mg/dL from baseline were observed in 37% and 53% of pre-liver transplantation patients by Weeks 48 and 96, respectively, by Kaplan-Meier estimates. Increases in serum creatinine greater than or equal to 0.3 mg/dL from baseline were observed in 32% and 51% of post-liver transplantation patients by Weeks 48 and 96, respectively, by Kaplan-Meier estimates.

<h2>12.3 Pharmacokinetics </h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Adult Subjects</span></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of adefovir have been evaluated in healthy volunteers and patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200763" conceptname="Chronic hepatitis">chronic hepatitis</span> B. Adefovir pharmacokinetics are similar between these populations.</p>
<p>Absorption</p>
<p>Adefovir dipivoxil is a diester prodrug of the active moiety adefovir. Based on a cross study comparison, the approximate oral bioavailability of adefovir from Adefovir Dipivoxil Tablets is 59%.</p>
<p>Following oral administration of a 10 mg single dose of Adefovir Dipivoxil Tablets to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200763" conceptname="Chronic hepatitis">chronic hepatitis</span> B patients (N=14), the peak adefovir plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) was 18.4 ± 6.26 ng/mL (mean ± SD) and occurred between 0.58 and 4.00 hours (median=1.75 hours) post dose. The adefovir area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC<span class="Sub">0–∞</span>) was 220 ± 70.0 ng·h/mL. Plasma adefovir concentrations declined in a biexponential manner with a terminal elimination half-life of 7.48 ± 1.65 hours.</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of adefovir in subjects with adequate renal function were not affected by once daily dosing of 10 mg Adefovir Dipivoxil Tablets over seven days. The impact of long-term once daily administration of 10 mg Adefovir Dipivoxil Tablets on adefovir pharmacokinetics has not been evaluated.</p>
<p>Effects of Food on Oral Absorption</p>
<p>Adefovir exposure was unaffected when a 10 mg single dose of Adefovir Dipivoxil Tablets was administered with food (an approximately 1000 kcal high-fat meal). Adefovir Dipivoxil Tablets may be taken without regard to food.</p>
<p>Distribution</p>
<p>In vitro binding of adefovir to human plasma or human serum proteins is less than or equal to 4% over the adefovir concentration range of 0.1 to 25 µg/mL. The volume of distribution at steady-state following intravenous administration of 1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg/day is 392 ± 75 and 352 ± 9 mL/kg, respectively.</p>
<p>Metabolism and Elimination</p>
<p>Following oral administration, adefovir dipivoxil is rapidly converted to adefovir. Forty-five percent of the dose is recovered as adefovir in the urine over 24 hours at steady state following 10 mg oral doses of Adefovir Dipivoxil Tablets. Adefovir is renally excreted by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion <span class="Italics">[See <a href="#adv-sec-7">Drug Interactions (7)</a> and <a href="#adv-sec-12.3">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</a>].</span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Assessment of Drug Interactions</span></p>
<p>Adefovir dipivoxil is rapidly converted to adefovir in vivo. At concentrations substantially higher (greater than 4000-fold) than those observed in vivo, adefovir did not inhibit any of the common human CYP450 enzymes, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Adefovir is not a substrate for these enzymes. However, the potential for adefovir to induce CYP450 enzymes is unknown. Based on the results of these in vitro experiments and the renal elimination pathway of adefovir, the potential for CYP450 mediated interactions involving adefovir as an inhibitor or substrate with other medicinal products is low.</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of adefovir have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers following multiple dose administration of Adefovir Dipivoxil Tablets (10 mg once daily) in combination with lamivudine (100 mg once daily) (N=18), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (160/800 mg twice daily) (N=18), acetaminophen (1000 mg four times daily) (N=20), ibuprofen (800 mg three times daily) (N=18), and enteric coated didanosine (400 mg) (N=21). The pharmacokinetics of adefovir have also been evaluated in post-liver transplantation patients following multiple dose administration of Adefovir Dipivoxil Tablets (10 mg once daily) in combination with tacrolimus (N=16). The pharmacokinetics of adefovir have been evaluated in healthy volunteers following single dose pegylated interferon α-2a (PEG-IFN) (180 mcg) (N=15).</p>
<p>Adefovir did not alter the pharmacokinetics of lamivudine, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, enteric coated didanosine (didanosine EC), or tacrolimus. The evaluation of the effect of adefovir on the pharmacokinetics of pegylated interferon α-2a was inconclusive due to the high variability of pegylated interferon α-2a.</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of adefovir were unchanged when Adefovir Dipivoxil Tablets was coadministered with lamivudine, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, acetaminophen, didanosine EC, tacrolimus (based on cross study comparison), and pegylated interferon α-2a. When Adefovir Dipivoxil Tablets was coadministered with ibuprofen (800 mg three times daily) increases in adefovir C<span class="Sub">max</span> (33%), AUC (23%) and urinary recovery were observed. This increase appears to be due to higher oral bioavailability, not a reduction in renal clearance of adefovir.</p>
<p>Apart from lamivudine, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and acetaminophen, the effects of co-administration of Adefovir Dipivoxil Tablets with drugs that are excreted renally, or other drugs known to affect renal function have not been evaluated.</p>
<p>The effect of adefovir on cyclosporine concentrations is not known.</p>

<h2>12.4 Microbiology</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Mechanism of Action</span></p>
<p>Adefovir is an acyclic nucleotide analog of adenosine monophosphate which is phosphorylated to the active metabolite adefovir diphosphate by cellular kinases. Adefovir diphosphate inhibits HBV DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) by competing with the natural substrate deoxyadenosine triphosphate and by causing DNA chain termination after its incorporation into viral DNA. The inhibition constant (Ki) for adefovir diphosphate for HBV DNA polymerase was 0.1 µM. Adefovir diphosphate is a weak inhibitor of human DNA polymerases α and γ with Ki values of 1.18 µM and 0.97 µM, respectively.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"></span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Antiviral Activity</span></p>
<p>The concentration of adefovir that inhibited 50% of viral DNA synthesis (EC<span class="Sup">50</span>) in HBV transfected human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4101758" conceptname="Hepatocellular carcinoma">hepatoma</span> cell lines ranged from 0.2 to 2.5 µM. The combination of adefovir with lamivudine showed additive anti-HBV activity.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Resistance</span></p>
<p>Clinical isolates with genotypic changes conferring reduced susceptibility in cell culture to nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors for the treatment of HBV <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> have been observed. Long-term resistance analyses performed by genotyping samples from all adefovir dipivoxil-treated patients with detectable serum HBV DNA demonstrated that amino acid substitutions rtN236T and rtA181T/V have been observed in association with adefovir resistance. In cell culture, the rtN236T substitution demonstrated 4- to 14-fold, the rtA181V substitution 2.5- to 4.2-fold, and the rtA181T substitution 1.3- to 1.9-fold reduced susceptibility to adefovir.</p>
<p>In HBeAg-positive nucleoside-naïve patient isolates (Study GS-98-437, N=171), no adefovir resistance-associated substitutions were observed at Week 48. Sixty-five patients continued on long term treatment after a median duration on adefovir dipivoxil of 235 weeks (range 110–279 weeks). Isolates from 16 of 38 (42%) patients developed adefovir resistance-associated substitutions in the setting of virologic failure (confirmed increase of at least log<span class="Sub">10</span> HBV DNA copies/mL above nadir or never suppressed below 10<span class="Sup">3</span> copies/mL). The substitutions included rtN236T (N=2), rtA181V (N=4), rtA181T (N=3), rtA181T+rtN236T (N=5), and rtA181V+rtN236T (N=2). In HBeAg-negative nucleoside-naïve patients (Study GS-98-438), isolates from 30 patients were identified with adefovir resistance-associated substitutions with a cumulative probability of 0%, 3%, 11%, 19%, and 30% at 48, 96, 144, 192, and 240 weeks, respectively. Of those 30 patients, 22 had a confirmed increase of at least log<span class="Sub">10</span> HBV DNA copies/mL above nadir or never achieved HBV DNA levels below 10<span class="Sup">3</span> copies/mL; an additional 8 patients had adefovir resistance-associated substitutions without virologic failure. In addition, the long term (4 to 5 years) development of resistance to adefovir dipivoxil was significantly lower in patients who had serum HBV DNA below the limit of quantification (less than 1,000 copies/mL) at Week 48 as compared to patients who had serum HBV DNA above 1,000 copies/mL at Week 48.</p>
<p>In an open-label study of pre- and post-liver transplantation patients (Study GS-98-435), isolates from 129 patients with clinical evidence of lamivudine-resistant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> B virus at baseline were evaluated for adefovir resistance-associated substitutions. The incidence of adefovir resistance-associated (rtN236T or rtA181T/V) substitutions was 0% at 48 weeks. Isolates from four patients developed the rtN236T substitution after 72 weeks of adefovir dipivoxil therapy. Development of the rtN236T substitution was associated with serum HBV DNA rebound. All 4 patients who developed the rtN236T substitution in their HBV had discontinued lamivudine therapy before the development of genotypic resistance and all 4 lost the lamivudine resistance-associated substitutions present at baseline. In a study of 35 HIV/HBV co-infected patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV (Study 460i) who added adefovir dipivoxil to lamivudine, no adefovir resistance-associated substitutions were observed in HBV isolates from 15/35 patients tested up to 144 weeks of therapy.</p>
<p>Clinical resistance in pediatric patients</p>
<p>In a Phase 3 pediatric Study GS-US-103-518, HBV isolates from 49 of 56 pediatric subjects (aged 12 to 17 years) had serum HBV DNA  greater than 169 copies/mL and were evaluated for adefovir resistance-associated substitutions. rtN236T and/or rtA181V adefovir resistance-associated substitutions were not observed at Week 48. However, the rtA181T substitution was present in baseline and Week 48 isolates from 2 pediatric patients.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Cross-resistance</span></p>
<p>Recombinant HBV variants containing lamivudine-resistance-associated substitutions (rtL180M, rtM204I, rtM204V, rtL180M + rtM204V, rtV173L + rtL180M + rtM204V) were susceptible to adefovir in cell culture. Adefovir dipivoxil has also demonstrated anti-HBV activity (median reduction in serum HBV DNA of 4.1 log<span class="Sub">10</span> copies/mL) in patients with HBV containing lamivudine-resistance-associated substitutions (Study 435). Adefovir also demonstrated in cell culture activity against HBV variants with entecavir resistance-associated substitutions (rtT184G, rtS202I, rtM250V). HBV variants with DNA polymerase substitutions rtT128N and rtR153Q or rtW153Q associated with resistance to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> B virus immunoglobulin were susceptible to adefovir in cell culture.</p>
<p>HBV variants expressing the adefovir resistance-associated substitution rtN236T showed no change in susceptibility to entecavir in cell culture, and a 2- to 3-fold decrease in lamivudine susceptibility. HBV mutants with the adefovir resistance-associated substitution rtA181V showed a range of decreased susceptibilities to lamivudine of 1- to 14-fold and a 12-fold decrease in susceptibility to entecavir. In patients whose HBV expressed the rtA181V substitution (N=2) or the rtN236T substitution (N=3), a reduction in serum HBV DNA of 2.4 to 3.1 and 2.0 to 5.1 log<span class="Sub">10</span> copies/mL, respectively, was observed when treatment with lamivudine was added to treatment with adefovir dipivoxil.</p>

<p>In Study 437, continued treatment with Adefovir Dipivoxil Tablets to 72 weeks resulted in continued maintenance of mean reductions in serum HBV DNA observed at Week 48. An increase in the proportion of patients with ALT normalization was also observed in Study 437. The effect of continued treatment with Adefovir Dipivoxil Tablets on seroconversion is unknown.</p>
<p>In Study 438, patients who received Adefovir Dipivoxil Tablets during the first 48 weeks were re-randomized in a blinded manner to continue on Adefovir Dipivoxil Tablets or receive placebo for an additional 48 weeks. At Week 96, 50 of 70 (71%) of patients who continued treatment with Adefovir Dipivoxil Tablets had undetectable HBV DNA levels (less than 1000 copies/mL), and 47 of 64 (73%) of patients had ALT normalization. HBV DNA and ALT levels returned towards baseline in most patients who stopped treatment with Adefovir Dipivoxil Tablets.</p>
<p>From 141 eligible patients, there were 125 (89%) patients in Study 438 who chose to continue Adefovir Dipivoxil Tablets for up to 192 weeks or 240 weeks (4 years or 5 years). As these patients had already received Adefovir Dipivoxil Tablets for at least 48 weeks and appeared to be experiencing a benefit, they are not necessarily representative of patients initiating Adefovir Dipivoxil Tablets. Of these patients, 89/125 (71%) and 47/70 (67%) had an undetectable HBV DNA level (less than 1000 copies/mL) at Week 192 and Week 240, respectively. Of the patients who had an elevated ALT at baseline, 77/104 (74%) and 42/64 (66%) had a normal ALT at Week 192 and Week 240, respectively. Six (5%) patients experienced HBsAg loss.</p>
