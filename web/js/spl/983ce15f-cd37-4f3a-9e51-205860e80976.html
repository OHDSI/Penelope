<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">OsmoPrep<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (sodium phosphate monobasic 
monohydrate, USP, and sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous, USP) is a purgative 
used to clean the colon prior to colonoscopy. OsmoPrep is manufactured with a 
highly soluble tablet binder and does not contain microcrystalline cellulose 
(MCC). OsmoPrep Tablets are oval, white to off-white compressed tablets, 
debossed with â€œSLXâ€? on one side of the bisect and â€œ102â€? on the other side of the 
bisect. Each OsmoPrep tablet contains 1.102 grams of sodium phosphate monobasic 
monohydrate, USP and 0.398 grams of sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous, USP for 
a total of 1.5 grams of sodium phosphate per tablet. Inert ingredients include 
polyethylene glycol 8000, NF; and magnesium stearate, NF. OsmoPrep is 
gluten-free.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">OsmoPrep Tablets, a dosing regimen containing 48 grams of sodium 
phosphate (32 tablets), induces <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, which effectively cleanses the entire 
colon. Each administration has a purgative effect for approximately 1 to 3 
hours. The primary mode of action is thought to be through the osmotic effect of 
sodium, causing large amounts of water to be drawn into the colon, promoting 
evacuation.</p>
<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a>Pharmacokinetics<p>Pharmacokinetic studies with OsmoPrep have not been conducted. 
However, the following pharmacokinetic study was conducted with VisicolÂ® tablets 
which contain the same active ingredients (sodium phosphate) as OsmoPrep. In 
addition, Visicol is administered at a dose that is 25% greater than the 
OsmoPrep dose.</p>
<p>An open-label pharmacokinetic study of Visicol in healthy volunteers was 
performed to determine the concentration-time profile of serum inorganic 
phosphorus levels after Visicol administration. All subjects received the 
approved Visicol dosing regimen (60 grams of sodium phosphate with a total 
liquid volume of 3.6 quarts) for colon cleansing. A 30 gram dose (20 tablets 
given as 3 tablets every 15 minutes with 8 ounces of clear liquids) was given 
beginning at 6 PM in the evening. The 30 gram dose (20 tablets given as 3 
tablets every 15 minutes with 8 ounces of clear liquids) was repeated the 
following morning beginning at 6 AM.</p>
<p>Twenty-three healthy subjects (mean age 57 years old; 57% male and 43% 
female; and 65% Hispanic, 30% Caucasian, and 4% African-American) participated 
in this pharmacokinetic study. The serum phosphorus level rose from a mean (Â± 
standard deviation) baseline of 4.0 (Â± 0.7) mg/dL to 7.7 (Â± 1.6 mg/dL), at a 
median of 3 hours after the administration of the first 30-gram dose of sodium 
phosphate tablets (see <a href="#section-">  Figure 1</a>). The serum phosphorus level 
rose to a mean of 8.4 (Â± 1.9) mg/dL, at a median of 4 hours after the 
administration of the second 30-gram dose of sodium phosphate tablets. The serum 
phosphorus level remained above baseline for a median of 24 hours after the 
administration of the initial dose of sodium phosphate tablets (range 16 to 48 
hours).</p>

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First">The colon cleansing efficacy and safety of OsmoPrep was evaluated 
in 2 randomized, investigator-blinded, actively controlled, multicenter, U.S. 
trials in patients scheduled to have an elective colonoscopy. The trials 
consisted of a dose ranging and a confirmatory phase 3 study.</p>
<p>In the phase 3 trial, patients were randomized into one of the following 
three sodium phosphate treatment groups: 1) Visicol containing 60 grams of 
sodium phosphate given in split doses (30 grams in the evening before the 
colonoscopy and 30 grams on the next day) with at least 3.6 quarts of clear 
liquids; 2) OsmoPrep containing 60 grams of sodium phosphate given in split 
doses (30 grams in the evening before the colonoscopy and 30 grams on the next 
day) with 2.5 quarts of clear liquids; and 3) OsmoPrep containing 48 grams of 
sodium phosphate (30 grams in the evening before the colonoscopy and 18 grams on 
the next day) with 2 quarts of clear liquids. Patients were instructed to eat a 
light breakfast before noon on the day prior to the colonoscopy and then were 
told to drink only clear liquids after noon on the day prior to the 
colonoscopy.</p>
<p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the overall colon cleansing response rate 
in the 4-point Colonic Contents Scale. Response was defined as a rating of 
â€œexcellentâ€? or â€œgoodâ€? on the 4-point scale as determined by the blinded 
colonoscopist. This phase 3 study was planned to assess the non-inferiority of 
the two OsmoPrep groups compared to the Visicol group.</p>
<p>The efficacy analysis included 704 adult patients who had an elective 
colonoscopy. Patients ranged in age from 21 to 89 years old (mean age 56 years 
old) with 55% female and 45% male patients. Race was distributed as follows: 87% 
Caucasian, 10% African American, and 3% other race. The OsmoPrep 60 gram and 48 
gram treatment groups demonstrated non-inferiority compared to Visicol. See 
Table 1 for the results.</p>

<span class="Sup">1</span>Â  Colon-cleansing efficacy was based on response rate to treatment. A patient was 
considered to be a responder if overall colon cleansing was rated as â€œexcellentâ€? 
or â€œgoodâ€? on a 4-point scale based on the amount of retained â€œcolonic contents.â€? 
Excellent was defined as greater than 90% of mucosa seen, mostly liquid stool, minimal

mucosa seen, mostly liquid stool, significant suctioning needed for adequate 
visualization. Fair was defined as greater than 90% of mucosa seen, mixture of liquid and 
semisolid stool, could be suctioned and/or washed. Inadequate was defined as 
less than 90% of mucosa seen, mixture of semisolid and solid stool which could not be

fluid intake, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, and/or use of diuretics.</p>
<p>Patients should be instructed not to administer additional laxative or 
purgative agents, particularly additional sodium phosphate-based purgative or 
enema products.</p>
<p>Prolongation of the QT interval has been observed in some patients who were 
dosed with sodium phosphate colon preparations. QT prolongation with sodium 
phosphate tablets has been associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022093" conceptname="Electrolyte imbalance">electrolyte imbalances</span>, such as 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435510" conceptname="Hypocalcemia">hypocalcemia</span>. OsmoPrep Tablets should be used with caution in 
patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval, since 
serious complications may occur. Pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs should be 
considered in patients with known prolonged QT.</p>
<p>Administration of OsmoPrep Tablets may induce colonic mucosal aphthous 
ulcerations, since this endoscopic finding was observed with other sodium 
phosphate cathartic preparations. In the OsmoPrep clinical program, aphthous 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcers</span> were observed in 3% of patients who took the 48 gram OsmoPrep dosing 
regimen. This colonoscopic finding should be considered in patients with known 
or suspected <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4074815" conceptname="Inflammatory bowel disease">inflammatory bowel disease</span>.</p>
<p>Because published data suggest that sodium phosphate absorption may be 
enhanced in patients experiencing an acute exacerbation of chronic inflammatory 
bowel disease, OsmoPrep Tablets should be used with caution in such 
patients.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Drug Interactions<p>Medications administered in close proximity to OsmoPrep Tablets

the carcinogenic potential of OsmoPrep. Studies to evaluate the effect of 
OsmoPrep on fertility or its mutagenic potential have not been performed.</p>

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pediatric Use<p>The safety and efficacy of OsmoPrep Tablets have not been 
demonstrated in patients less than 18 years of age.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Geriatric Use<p>In controlled colon preparation trials of OsmoPrep, 228 (24%) of 
931 patients were 65 years of age or older. In addition, 49 (5%) of the 931 
patients were 75 years of age or older.</p>
<p>Of the 228 geriatric patients in the trials, 134 patients (59%) received at 
least 48 grams of OsmoPrep. Of the 49 patients 75 years old or older in the 
trials, 27 (55%) patients received at least 48 grams of OsmoPrep.Â  No overall 
differences inÂ safety or effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients 
and younger patients. However, the mean phosphate levels in geriatric patients 
were greater than the phosphate levels in younger patients after OsmoPrep 
administration. The mean colonoscopy-day phosphate levels in patients 18-64, 
65-74, and â‰¥ 75 years old who received 48 grams of OsmoPrep in the phase 3 study 
were 7.0, 7.3, and 8.0 mg/dL, respectively. In addition, in all three sodium 
phosphate treatment groups, the mean phosphate levels in patients 18-64, 65-74, 
and â‰¥ 75 years old in the phase 3 study were 7.4, 7.9, and 8.0 mg/dL, 
respectively, after sodium phosphate administration. Greater sensitivity of some 
older individuals cannot be ruled out; therefore, OsmoPrep Tablets should be 
used with caution in geriatric patients.</p>
<p>Sodium phosphate is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the 
risk of adverse reactions with sodium phosphate may be greater in patients with 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>. Since geriatric patients are more likely to have 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>, consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy labs 
(phosphate, calcium, potassium, sodium, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients 
(see <a href="#d180fb29-7b1f-257f-ffb5-8bede3e82cb3">WARNINGS</a>). It is 
recommended that patients receiving OsmoPrep be advised to adequately hydrate 
before, during, and after the use of OsmoPrep.</p>
