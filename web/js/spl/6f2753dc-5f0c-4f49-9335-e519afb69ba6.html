<h1>DESCRIPTION
</h1>
<p class="First">PASER granules are a delayed release granule preparation of aminosalicylic acid (p-aminosalicylic acid; 4-aminosalicylic acid) for use with other anti-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span> drugs for the treatment of all forms of active <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span> due to susceptible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of tubercle bacilli. The granules are designed for gradual release to avoid high peak levels not useful (and perhaps toxic) with bacteriostatic drugs. Aminosalicylic acid is rapidly degraded in acid media; the protective acid-resistant outer coating is rapidly dissolved in neutral media so a mildly acidic food such as orange, apple or tomato juice, yogurt or apple sauce should be used.
</p>
<p>Aminosalicylic acid (p-aminosalicylic acid) is 4-Amino-2-hydroxybenzoic acid. PASER granules are the free base of aminosalicylic acid and do NOT contain sodium or a sugar. The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">7</span>H<span class="Sub">7</span>NO<span class="Sub">3</span> with a molecular weight of 153.14. With heat p-aminosalicylic acid is decarboxylated to produce CO<span class="Sub">2</span> and m-aminophenol. If the airtight packets are swollen, storage has been improper. DO NOT USE if packets are swollen or the granules have lost their tan color and are dark brown or purple.
</p>
<p>The structural formula is:

</div>
<p>PASER granules are supplied as off-white tan colored granules with an average diameter of 1.5 mm and an average content of 60% aminosalicylic acid by weight. The acid resistant outer coating will be completely removed by a few minutes at a neutral pH. The inert ingredients are:

<p>The packets contain 4 grams of aminosalicylic acid for oral administration three times a day by sprinkling on apple sauce or yogurt to be eaten without chewing. Suspension in an acidic fruit drink such as orange juice or tomato juice will protect the coating for at least 2 hours. Swirling the juice in the glass will help resuspend the granules if they sink.

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="43679-0">
<a name="s4"></a><a name="section-3.1"></a><p></p>
<p class="First">Mechanism of Action: Aminosalicylic acid is bacteriostatic against Mycobacterium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span>. It inhibits the onset of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4207042" conceptname="Viral resistance">bacterial resistance</span> to streptomycin and isoniazid. The mechanism of action has been postulated to be inhibition of folic acid synthesis (but without potentiation with antifolic compounds) and/or inhibition of synthesis of the cell wall component, mycobactin, thus reducing iron uptake by M. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span>.
</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s25"></a><a name="section-3.2"></a><p></p>
<p class="First">Characteristics: The two major considerations in the clinical pharmacology of aminosalicylic acid are the prompt production of a toxic inactive metabolite under acid conditions and the short serum half life of one hour for the free drug. Both are discussed below.
</p>
<p>After two hours in simulated gastric fluid, 10% of unprotected aminosalicylic acid is decarboxylated to form meta-aminophenol, a known hepatotoxin. The acid-resistant coating of the PASER granules protects against degradation in the stomach. The small granules are designed to escape the usual restriction on gastric emptying of large particles. Under neutral conditions such as are found in the small intestine or in neutral foods, the acid-resistant coating is dissolved within one minute. Care must be taken in the administration of these granules to protect the acid-resistant coating by maintaining the granules in an acidic food during dosage administration. Patients who have neutralized gastric acid with antacids will not need to protect the acid resistant coating with an acidic food since no acid is present to spoil the drug. Antacids may influence the absorption of other medications and are not necessary for PASER consumed with an acidic food.
</p>
<p>Because PASER granules are protected by an enteric coating absorption does not commence until they leave the stomach; the soft skeletons of the granules remain and may be seen in the stool.
</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s26"></a><a name="section-3.3"></a><p></p>
<p class="First">Absorption and excretion: In a single 4 gram pharmacokinetic study with food in normal volunteers the initial time to a 2Î¼g/mL serum level of aminosalicylic acid was 2 hours with a range of 45 minutes to 24 hours; the median time to peak was 6 hours with a range of 1.5 to 24 hours; the mean peak level was 20 Î¼g/mL with a range of 9 to 35 Î¼g/mL; a level of 2 Î¼g/mL was maintained for an average of 7.9 hours with a range of 5 to 9; a level of 1 Î¼g/mL was maintained for an average of 8.8 hours with a range of 6 to 11.5 hours. The recommended schedule is 4 grams every 8 hours.
</p>
<p>80% of aminosalicylic acid is excreted in the urine, with 50% or more of the dosage excreted in acetylated form. The acetylation process is not genetically determined as is the case for isoniazid. Aminosalicylic acid is excreted by glomerular filtration; although previously reported otherwise, probenecid, a tubular blocking agent, does not enhance plasma concentration. In a 1954 study thyroxine synthesis but not iodide uptake was reported reduced about 40% when the sodium salt (not PASER granules) of aminosalicylic acid was administered one hour before radio-iodine; the sodium salt typically produces a serum level over 120 Î¼g/mL at one hour lasting one hour. Occasional <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135772" conceptname="Goiter">goiter</span> development can be prevented by the administration of thyroxine but not iodide.
</p>
<p>Penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid occurs only if the meminges are inflamed.
</p>
<p>Approximately 50-60% of aminosalicylic acid is protein bound; binding is reported to be reduced 50% in kwashiorkor.

<p class="First">Microbiology: The aminosalicylic acid MIC for M. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span> in 7H11 agar was less than 1.0 Î¼g/mL for nine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> including three multidrug resistant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span>, but 4 and 8 Î¼g/mL for two other multidrug resistant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span>. The 90% inhibition in 7H12 broth (Bactec) showed little dose response but was interpreted as being less than or equal to 0.12-0.25 Î¼g/mL for eight <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of which three were multi-resistant, 0.50 Î¼g/mL for one resistant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span>, questionable for four non-resistant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> and greater than 1Î¼g/mL for one non-resistant and three resistant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span>.

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE
</h1>
<p class="First">PASER is indicated for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span> in combination with other active agents. It is most commonly used in patients with Multi-drug Resistant TB (MDR-TB) or in situations when therapy with isoniazid and rifampin is not possible due to a combination of resistance and/or intolerance. When PASER is added to the treatment regimen in patients proven or suspected <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4150981" conceptname="Drug resistance">drug resistance</span>, it should be accompanied by at least one and preferably two other new agents to which the patient's organism is known or expected to be susceptible.

<p class="First"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">Hypersensitivity</span> to any component of this medication.
</p>
<p>Severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>.
</p>
<p>Patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span> will accumulate aminosalicylic acid and its acetyl metabolite but will continue to acetylate, thus leading exclusively to the inactive acetylated form; deacetylation, if any, is not significant.
</p>
<p>The half life of free aminosalicylic acid in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span> is 30.8 minutes in comparison to 26.4 minutes in normal volunteers. but the half life of the inactive metabolite is 309 minutes in uremic patients in comparison to 51 minutes in normal volunteers. Although aminosalicylic acid passes dialysis membranes, the frequency of dialysis usually is not comparable to the half-life of 50 minutes for the free acid. Patients with end stage <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span> should not receive aminosalicylic acid.

<a name="s9"></a><a name="section-6.1"></a><p></p>
<p class="First">Liver Function
</p>
<p>In one retrospective study of 7492 patients on rapidly absorbed aminosalicylic acid preparations, drug-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> occurred in 38 patients (0.5%); in these 38 the first symptom usually appeared within three months of the start of therapy with a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> as the most common event followed by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span> and much less frequently by GI disturbances of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">anorexia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>. Only one patient was diagnosed on routine biochemistry.
</p>
<p>Premonitory symptoms in 90% of these 38 patients preceded <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span> by a <span class="Underline">few
</span><span class="Underline">days</span> to several weeks with the mean time of onset 33 days with a range of 7-90 days. Half of the adverse reactions occurred during the third, fourth or fifth weeks. When aminosalicylic acid-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> was diagnosed, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197676" conceptname="Large liver">hepatomegaly</span> was invariably present with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315085" conceptname="Lymphadenopathy">lymphadenopathy</span> in 46%, leucocytosis in 79%, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302954" conceptname="Disorder characterized by eosinophilia">eosinophilia</span> in 55%. Prompt recognition with discontinuation led to the recovery of all 38 patients.

<h1>PRECAUTIONS
</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34072-9">
<a name="s11"></a><a name="section-7.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>(1) General:
</h2>
<p class="First">All drugs should be stopped at the first sign suggesting a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reaction</span>. They may be restarted one at a time in very small but gradually increasing doses to determine whether the manifestations are drug-induced and, if so, which drug is responsible.
</p>
<p>Desensitization has been accomplished successfully in 15 of 17 patients starting with 10 mg aminosalicylic acid given as a single dose. The dosage is doubled every 2 days until reaching a total of 1 gram after which the dosage is divided to follow the regular schedule of administration. If a mild temperature rise or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089139" conceptname="Skin reaction">skin reaction</span> develops, the increment is to be dropped back one level or the progression held for one cycle. Reactions are rare after a total dosage of 1.5 grams.
</p>
<p>Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span> may not tolerate aminosalicylic acid as well as normal patients, even though the metabolism in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span> has been reported to be comparable to that in normal volunteers.
</p>
</div>

<a name="s12"></a><a name="section-7.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>(2) Information for Patients:
</h2>
<p class="First">The patient should be advised that the first signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> include a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>, often followed by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, and much less frequently, GI disturbances of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">anorexia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>. If such symptoms develop, the patient should immediately cease taking the medication and arrange for a prompt clinical visit.
</p>
<p>Patients should be advised that poor compliance in taking anti-TB medication often leads to treatment failure, and, not infrequently, to the development of resistance of the organisms in the individual patient.
</p>
<p>Patients should be advised that the skeleton of the granules may be seen in the stool.
</p>
<p>The coating to protect the PASER granules dissolves promptly under neutral conditions; the granules therefore should be administered by sprinkling on acidic foods such as apple sauce or yogurt or by suspension in a fruit drink which will protect the coating, but the granules sink and will have to be swirled. The coating will last at least 2 hours in either system. All juices tested to date have been satisfactory; tested are: tomato, orange, grapefruit, grape, cranberry, apple, â€œfruit punchâ€?.
</p>
<p>Patients should be advised to store PASER in a refrigerator or freezer. PASER packets may be stored at room temperature for short periods of time.
</p>
<p>Patients should be advised NOT to use if the packets are swollen or the granules have lost their tan color and are dark brown or purple. The patient should inform the pharmacist or physician immediately and return the medication.

<h2>(3) Laboratory Tests:
</h2>
<p class="First">Aminosalicylic acid has been reported to interfere technically with the serum determinations of albumin by dye-binding, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4094657" conceptname="Aspartate aminotransferase">SGOT</span> by the azoene dye method and with qualitative urine tests for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4017413" conceptname="Acetoacetate">ketones</span>, bilirubin, urobilinogen or porphobilinogen.

</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34073-7">
<a name="s14"></a><a name="section-7.4"></a><p></p>
<h2>(4) Drug Interactions:
</h2>
<p class="First">Aminosalicylic acid at a dosage of 12 grams in a rapidly available form has been reported to produce a 20 percent reduction in the acetylation of isoniazid, especially in patients who are rapid acetylators; INH serum levels, half lives and excretions in fast acetylators still remain half of the levels seen in slow acetylators with or without p-aminosalicylic acid. The effect is dose related and, while it has not been studied with the current delayed release preparation, the lower serum levels with this preparation will result in a reduced effect on the acetylation of INH.
</p>
<p>Aminosalicylic acid has previously been reported to block the absorption of rifampin. A subsequent report has shown that this blockade was due to an excipient not included in PASER granules. Oral administration of a solution containing both aminosalicylic acid and rifampin showed full absorption of each product.
</p>
<p>As a result of competition, Vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> absorption has been reduced 55% by 5 grams of aminosalicylic acid with clinically significant erythrocyte abnormalities developing after depletion; patients on therapy of more than one month should be considered for maintenance B<span class="Sub">12</span>.
</p>
<p>A <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194993" conceptname="Intestinal malabsorption">malabsorption syndrome</span> can develop in patients on aminosalicylic acid but is usually not complete. The complete syndrome includes <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200146" conceptname="Pancreatic steatorrhea">steatorrhea</span>, an abnormal small bowel pattern on x-ray, villus <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4028206" conceptname="Atrophy">atrophy</span>, depressed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>, reduced D-xylose and iron absorption. Triglyceride absorption always is normal.
</p>
<p>In one literature report 8 hours after the last dosage of aminosalicylic acid at 2 gm qid serum digoxin levels were reduced 40% in two of ten patients but not changed in the remaining eight.

<h2>(5) Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility:
</h2>
<p class="First">Sodium aminosalicylate produced an occipital bone defect, probably with a dose response, when administered to ten pregnant Wistar rats at five doses from 3.85 to 385 mg/kg from days 6 to 14. There were no significant changes from controls in any group in corpora lutea, early resorptions, total resorptions, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079844" conceptname="Fetal death">fetal death</span>, litter size, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4147001" conceptname="Hematoma">hematomas</span>. For all except the 77 mg/kg group, fetal weights were significantly greater than controls. Chinchilla rabbits on 5 mg/kg from days 7 to 14 did not show any significant differences as compared to controls for the same parameters studied.
</p>
<p>Sodium aminosalicylic acid was not mutagenic in Ames tester <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span> TA 100. In human lymphocyte cultures in-vitro clastogenic effects of achromatic, chromatid, isochromatic breaks or chromatid translocations were not seen at 153 or 600 Î¼g/mL. At 1500 and 3000 Î¼g/mL there was a dose related increase in chromatid aberrations.
</p>
<p>Patients on isoniazid and aminosalicylic acid have been reported to have an increased number of chromosomal aberrations as compared to controls.

<h2>(6) Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C:
</h2>
<p class="First">Aminosalicylic acid has been reported to produce occipital malformations in rats when given at doses within the human dose range. Although there probably is a dose response, the frequency of abnormalities was comparable to controls at the highest level tested (two times the human dosage). When administered to rabbits at 5 mg/kg, throughout all three trimesters, no teratologic or embryocidal effects were seen. Literature reports on aminosalicylic acid in pregnant women always report coadministration of other medications. Because there are no adequate and well controlled studies of aminosalicylic acid in humans, PASER granules should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.
