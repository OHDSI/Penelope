<p>The empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">14</span>H<span class="Sub">21</span>N<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span>S•C<span class="Sub">4</span>H<span class="Sub">6</span>O<span class="Sub">4</span>, representing a molecular weight of 413.5. Sumatriptan succinate is a white to off-white powder that is readily soluble in water and in saline. Each IMITREX Tablet for oral administration contains 35, 70, or 140 mg of sumatriptan succinate equivalent to 25, 50, or 100 mg of sumatriptan, respectively. Each tablet also contains the inactive ingredients croscarmellose sodium, dibasic calcium phosphate, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, and sodium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span>. Each 100-mg tablet also contains hypromellose, iron oxide, titanium dioxide, and triacetin.</p>

<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Sumatriptan is an agonist for a vascular 5‑hydroxytryptamine<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor subtype (probably a member of the 5‑HT<span class="Sub">1D</span> family) having only a weak affinity for 5‑HT<span class="Sub">1A</span>, 5‑HT<span class="Sub">5A</span>, and 5‑HT<span class="Sub">7</span> receptors and no significant affinity (as measured using standard radioligand binding assays) or pharmacological activity at 5‑HT<span class="Sub">2</span>, 5‑HT<span class="Sub">3, </span>or 5‑HT<span class="Sub">4</span> receptor subtypes or at alpha<span class="Sub">1</span>‑, alpha<span class="Sub">2</span>‑, or beta‑adrenergic; dopamine<span class="Sub">1</span>; dopamine<span class="Sub">2</span>; muscarinic; or benzodiazepine receptors.</p>
<p>The vascular 5‑HT<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor subtype that sumatriptan activates is present on cranial arteries in both dog and primate, on the human basilar artery, and in the vasculature of human dura mater and mediates <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137788" conceptname="Vascular constriction">vasoconstriction</span>. This action in humans correlates with the relief of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">migraine headache</span>. In addition to causing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137788" conceptname="Vascular constriction">vasoconstriction</span>, experimental data from animal studies show that sumatriptan also activates 5‑HT<span class="Sub">1</span> receptors on peripheral terminals of the trigeminal nerve innervating cranial blood vessels. Such an action may also contribute to the antimigrainous effect of sumatriptan in humans.</p>
<p>In the anesthetized dog, sumatriptan selectively reduces the carotid arterial blood flow with little or no effect on arterial blood pressure or total peripheral resistance. In the cat, sumatriptan selectively constricts the carotid arteriovenous anastomoses while having little effect on blood flow or resistance in cerebral or extracerebral tissues.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">The mean maximum concentration following oral dosing with 25 mg is 18 ng/mL (range: 7 to 47 ng/mL) and 51 ng/mL (range: 28 to 100 ng/mL) following oral dosing with 100 mg of sumatriptan. This compares with a C<span class="Sub">max</span> of 5 and 16 ng/mL following dosing with a 5- and 20‑mg intranasal dose, respectively. The mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> following a 6‑mg subcutaneous injection is 71 ng/mL (range: 49 to 110 ng/mL). The bioavailability is approximately 15%, primarily due to presystemic metabolism and partly due to incomplete absorption. The C<span class="Sub">max</span> is similar during a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">migraine</span> attack and during a migraine‑free period, but the T<span class="Sub">max</span> is slightly later during the attack, approximately 2.5 hours compared to 2.0 hours. When given as a single dose, sumatriptan displays dose proportionality in its extent of absorption (area under the curve [AUC]) over the dose range of 25 to 200 mg, but the C<span class="Sub">max</span> after 100 mg is approximately 25% less than expected (based on the 25‑mg dose). </p>
<p>A food effect study involving administration of IMITREX Tablets 100 mg to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and with a high‑fat meal indicated that the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC were increased by 15% and 12%, respectively, when administered in the fed state. </p>
<p>Plasma protein binding is low (14% to 21%). The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated, but would be expected to be minor, given the low rate of protein binding. The apparent volume of distribution is 2.4 L/kg.</p>
<p>The elimination half‑life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours. Radiolabeled <span class="Sup">14</span>C‑sumatriptan administered orally is largely renally excreted (about 60%) with about 40% found in the feces. Most of the radiolabeled compound excreted in the urine is the major metabolite, indole acetic acid (IAA), which is inactive, or the IAA glucuronide. Only 3% of the dose can be recovered as unchanged sumatriptan.</p>
<p>In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO), predominantly the A isoenzyme, and inhibitors of that enzyme may alter sumatriptan pharmacokinetics to increase systemic exposure. No significant effect was seen with an MAO‑B inhibitor (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).</p>

Accordingly, the bioavailability of sumatriptan following oral administration may be markedly increased in patients with liver disease. In 1 small study of hepatically impaired patients (N = 8) matched for sex, age, and weight with healthy subjects, the hepatically impaired patients had an approximately 70% increase in AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> and a T<span class="Sub">max</span> 40 minutes earlier compared to the healthy subjects (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</p>

<p>Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a study of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan. Under the conditions of this experiment, the result was a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration × time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. This interaction was not evident with an MAO-B inhibitor.</p>
<p>A small study evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25-mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Alcohol:</span></span> Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First">The efficacy of IMITREX Tablets in the acute treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">migraine headaches</span> was demonstrated in 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Patients enrolled in these 3 studies were predominately female (87%) and Caucasian (97%), with a mean age of 40 years (range, 18 to 65 years). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">Headache</span> response, defined as a reduction in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> severity from moderate or severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> to mild or no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, was assessed up to 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260194" conceptname="Photophobia">photophobia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4209114" conceptname="Phonophobia">phonophobia</span> were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours postdose. A second dose of IMITREX Tablets or other medication was allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>. Acetaminophen was offered to patients in Studies 2 and 3 beginning at 2 hours after initial treatment if the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">migraine</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> had not improved or worsened. Additional medications were allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> or as rescue in all 3 studies. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also determined. In all studies, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were compared to placebo in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">migraine</span> attacks. In 1 study, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were also compared to each other. </p>
<p>In all 3 trials, the percentage of patients achieving <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> response 2 and 4 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients receiving IMITREX Tablets at all doses compared to those who received placebo. In 1 of the 3 studies, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> response at 2 and 4 hours in the 50- or 100-mg group when compared to the 25-mg dose groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the 50- and 100-mg dose groups in any study. The results from the 3 controlled clinical trials are summarized in Table 1.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Comparisons of drug performance based upon results obtained in different clinical trials are never reliable. Because studies are conducted at different times, with different samples of patients, by different investigators, employing different criteria and/or different interpretations of the same criteria, under different conditions (dose, dosing regimen, etc.), quantitative estimates of treatment response and the timing of response may be expected to vary considerably from study to study.</span></p>

<h2>Drug-Associated Cardiac Events and Fatalities</h2>
<p class="First">Serious adverse cardiac events, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">acute myocardial infarction</span>, life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> have been reported within a few hours following the administration of IMITREX<span class="Sup">®</span> (sumatriptan succinate) Injection or IMITREX Tablets. Considering the extent of use of sumatriptan in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">migraine</span>, the incidence of these events is extremely low. </p>
<p>The fact that sumatriptan can cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4127089" conceptname="Coronary artery spasm">coronary vasospasm</span>, that some of these events have occurred in patients with no prior cardiac disease history and with documented absence of CAD, and the close proximity of the events to sumatriptan use support the conclusion that some of these cases were caused by the drug. In many cases, however, where there has been known underlying <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317576" conceptname="Coronary arteriosclerosis">coronary artery disease</span>, the relationship is uncertain.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Premarketing Experience </span></span><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">With</span></span><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"></span></span><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Sumatriptan</span></span><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">:</span></span> Of 6,348 patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">migraine</span> who participated in premarketing controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of oral sumatriptan, 2 experienced clinical adverse events shortly after receiving oral sumatriptan that may have reflected <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4127089" conceptname="Coronary artery spasm">coronary vasospasm</span>. Neither of these adverse events was associated with a serious clinical outcome.</p>
<p>Among the more than 1,900 patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">migraine</span> who participated in premarketing controlled clinical trials of subcutaneous sumatriptan, there were 8 patients who sustained clinical events during or shortly after receiving sumatriptan that may have reflected coronary artery <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4215494" conceptname="Vasospasm">vasospasm</span>. Six of these 8 patients had ECG changes consistent with transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4200991" conceptname="Ischemia">ischemia</span>, but without accompanying clinical symptoms or signs. Of these 8 patients, 4 had either findings suggestive of CAD or risk factors predictive of CAD prior to study enrollment.</p>
<p>Among approximately 4,000 patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">migraine</span> who participated in premarketing controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of sumatriptan nasal spray, 1 patient experienced an asymptomatic subendocardial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4206471" conceptname="Infarct">infarction</span> possibly subsequent to a coronary vasospastic event.</p>

The uncontrolled nature of postmarketing surveillance, however, makes it impossible to determine definitively the proportion of the reported cases that were actually caused by sumatriptan or to reliably assess causation in individual cases. On clinical grounds, the longer the latency between the administration of IMITREX and the onset of the clinical event, the less likely the association is to be causative. Accordingly, interest has focused on events beginning within 1 hour of the administration of IMITREX.</p>
<p>Cardiac events that have been observed to have onset within 1 hour of sumatriptan administration include: coronary artery <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4215494" conceptname="Vasospasm">vasospasm</span>, transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4200991" conceptname="Ischemia">ischemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">ventricular tachycardia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437894" conceptname="Ventricular fibrillation">ventricular fibrillation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.</p>
<p>Some of these events occurred in patients who had no findings of CAD and appear to represent consequences of coronary artery <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4215494" conceptname="Vasospasm">vasospasm</span>. However, among domestic reports of serious cardiac events within 1 hour of sumatriptan administration, almost all of the patients had risk factors predictive of CAD and the presence of significant underlying CAD was established in most cases (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Carcinogenesis:</span></span> In carcinogenicity studies, rats and mice were given sumatriptan by oral gavage (rats: 104 weeks) or drinking water (mice: 78 weeks). Average exposures achieved in mice receiving the highest dose (target dose of 160 mg/kg/day) were approximately 40 times the exposure attained in humans after the maximum recommended single oral dose of 100 mg. The highest dose administered to rats (160 mg/kg/day, reduced from 360 mg/kg/day during week 21) was approximately 15 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. There was no evidence of an increase in tumors in either species related to sumatriptan administration.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Mutagenesis:</span></span> Sumatriptan was not mutagenic in the presence or absence of metabolic activation when tested in 2 gene mutation assays (the Ames test and the in vitro mammalian Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT assay). In 2 cytogenetics assays (the in vitro human lymphocyte assay and the in vivo rat micronucleus assay) sumatriptan was not associated with clastogenic activity.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Impairment of Fertility:</span></span> In a study in which male and female rats were dosed daily with oral sumatriptan prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatment-related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with 50 and 500 mg/kg/day. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 5 mg/kg/day, or approximately one half of the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. It is not clear whether the problem is associated with treatment of the males or females or both combined. In a similar study by the subcutaneous route there was no evidence of impaired fertility at 60 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, which is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. </p>

<h2>Pregnancy</h2>
<p class="First">Pregnancy Category C. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral treatment with sumatriptan was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to rabbits, sumatriptan has been shown to be embryolethal. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, IMITREX should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In assessing this information, the following findings should be considered.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Embryolethality</span></span><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">:</span></span> When given orally or intravenously to pregnant rabbits daily throughout the period of organogenesis, sumatriptan caused embryolethality at doses at or close to those producing maternal toxicity. In the oral studies this dose was 100 mg/kg/day, and in the intravenous studies this dose was 2.0 mg/kg/day. The mechanism of the embryolethality is not known. The highest no-effect dose for embryolethality by the oral route was 50 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 9 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. By the intravenous route, the highest no-effect dose was 0.75 mg/kg/day, or approximately one tenth of the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. </p>
<p>The intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats throughout organogenesis at 12.5 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, did not cause embryolethality. This dose is equivalent to the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. Additionally, in a study in rats given subcutaneous sumatriptan daily prior to and throughout pregnancy at 60 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, there was no evidence of increased embryo/fetal lethality. This dose is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">Teratogenicity</span></span></span><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">:</span></span> Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of blood vessel abnormalities (cervicothoracic and umbilical) at doses of approximately 250 mg/kg/day or higher. The highest no-effect dose was approximately 60 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rabbits with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for these effects was 15 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p>
<p>A study in which rats were dosed daily with oral sumatriptan prior to and throughout gestation demonstrated embryo/fetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of rib variations) and an increased incidence of a syndrome of malformations (short tail/short body and vertebral disorganization) at 500 mg/kg/day. The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day, or approximately 5 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. In a study in rats dosed daily with subcutaneous sumatriptan prior to and throughout pregnancy, at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, there was no evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span>. This dose is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sub">2</span> basis.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Pup <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Deaths</span>:</span></span> Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in a decrease in pup survival between birth and postnatal day 4 at doses of approximately 250 mg/kg/day or higher. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was approximately 60 mg/kg/day, or 6 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p>
<p>Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan from gestational day 17 through postnatal day 21 demonstrated a decrease in pup survival measured at postnatal days 2, 4, and 20 at the dose of 1,000 mg/kg/day. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. In a similar study in rats by the subcutaneous route there was no increase in pup <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> at 81 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested, which is equivalent to 8 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p>

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of IMITREX Tablets in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established; therefore, IMITREX Tablets are not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age.</p>
<p>Two controlled clinical trials evaluating sumatriptan nasal spray (5 to 20 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 1,248 adolescent migraineurs who treated a single attack. The studies did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared to placebo in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">migraine</span> in adolescents. Adverse events observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults.</p>
<p>Five controlled clinical trials (2 single attack studies, 3 multiple attack studies) evaluating oral sumatriptan (25 to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These studies did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared to placebo in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">migraine</span> in adolescents. Adverse events observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse events in these patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting events more commonly than older adolescents. </p>
<p>Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse events have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal sumatriptan. These reports include events similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, visual loss, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.

<p>IMITREX Tablets are generally well tolerated. Across all doses, most adverse reactions were mild and transient and did not lead to long-lasting effects. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events.</p>

<h2>Other Events Observed in Association With the Administration of IMITREX Tablets</h2>
<p class="First">In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of IMITREX Tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used IMITREX Tablets (25, 50, or 100 mg) and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 6,348) exposed to IMITREX Tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients.</p>

<h2>Postmarketing Experience (Reports for Subcutaneous or Oral Sumatriptan)</h2>
<p class="First">The following section enumerates potentially important adverse events that have occurred in clinical practice and that have been reported spontaneously to various surveillance systems. The events enumerated represent reports arising from both domestic and nondomestic use of oral or subcutaneous dosage forms of sumatriptan. The events enumerated include all except those already listed in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section above or those too general to be informative. Because the reports cite events reported spontaneously from worldwide postmarketing experience, frequency of events and the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. It is assumed, however, that systemic reactions following sumatriptan use are likely to be similar regardless of route of administration.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">In controlled clinical trials, single doses of 25, 50, or 100 mg of IMITREX Tablets were effective for the acute treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">migraine</span> in adults. There is evidence that doses of 50 and 100 mg may provide a greater effect than 25 mg (see CLINICAL TRIALS). There is also evidence that doses of 100 mg do not provide a greater effect than 50 mg. Individuals may vary in response to doses of IMITREX Tablets. The choice of dose should therefore be made on an individual basis, weighing the possible benefit of a higher dose with the potential for a greater risk of adverse events.</p>
<p>If the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> returns or the patient has a partial response to the initial dose, the dose may be repeated after 2 hours, not to exceed a total daily dose of 200 mg. If a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> returns following an initial treatment with IMITREX Injection, additional single IMITREX Tablets (up to 100 mg/day) may be given with an interval of at least 2 hours between tablet doses. The safety of treating an average of more than 4 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headaches</span> in a 30-day period has not been established.</p>
<p>Because of the potential of MAO-A inhibitors to cause unpredictable elevations in the bioavailability of oral sumatriptan, their combined use is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic disease</span>/functional impairment may also cause unpredictable elevations in the bioavailability of orally administered sumatriptan. Consequently, if treatment is deemed advisable in the presence of liver disease, the maximum single dose should in general not exceed 50 mg (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY for the basis of this recommendation).</p>

<h2>Corneal Opacities</h2>
<p class="First">Dogs receiving oral sumatriptan developed corneal opacities and defects in the corneal epithelium. Corneal opacities were seen at the lowest dosage tested, 2 mg/kg/day, and were present after 1 month of treatment. Defects in the corneal epithelium were noted in a 60-week study. Earlier examinations for these toxicities were not conducted and no-effect doses were not established; however, the relative exposure at the lowest dose tested was approximately 5 times the human exposure after a 100-mg oral dose. There is evidence of alterations in corneal appearance on the first day of intranasal dosing to dogs. Changes were noted at the lowest dose tested, which was approximately one half the maximum single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p>
