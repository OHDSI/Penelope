<h1>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>â€¢Starting Dose: 200 mg per day given as 100 mg twice daily (2.1)â€¢General: Increase dose gradually to reduce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> risk. (2.1, 5.3)â€¢After 3 days, may increase the dose to 300 mg per day, given as 100 mg 3 times daily at an interval of at least 6 hours between doses. (2.1) â€¢Usual target dose: 300 mg per day as 100 mg 3 times daily. (2.1) â€¢Maximum dose: 450 mg per day given as 150 mg 3 times daily. (2.1) â€¢Periodically reassess the dose and need for maintenance treatment. (2.1)â€¢Moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>: 75 mg once daily. (2.2, 8.7) â€¢Mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>: Consider reducing the dose and/or frequency of dosing.

Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>To minimize the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span>, increase the dose gradually <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>. Increases in dose should not exceed 100Â mg per day in a 3â€‘day period. WELLBUTRIN Tablets should be swallowed whole and not crushed, divided, or chewed. WELLBUTRIN may be taken with or without food.</p>
<p>The recommended starting dose is 200Â mg per day, given as 100Â mg twice daily. After 3 days of dosing, the dose may be increased to 300Â mg per day, given as 100Â mg 3 times daily, with at least 6 hours between successive doses. Dosing above 300 mg per day may be accomplished using the 75- or 100-mg tablets.</p>
<p>A maximum of 450Â mg per day, given in divided doses of not more than 150Â mg each, may be considered for patients who show no clinical improvement after several weeks of treatment at 300Â mg per day. Administer the 100â€‘mg tablet 4 times daily to not exceed the limit of 150Â mg in a single dose. </p>
<p>It is generally agreed that acute episodes of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> require several months or longer of antidepressant drug treatment beyond the response in the acute episode. It is unknown whether the dose of WELLBUTRIN needed for maintenance treatment is identical to the dose that provided an initial response. Periodically reassess the need for maintenance treatment and the appropriate dose for such treatment.</p>

<p></p>
<p>In patients with moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> (Child-Pugh score: 7 to15), the maximum dose of WELLBUTRIN is 75Â mg per day. In patients with mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> (Child-Pugh score: 5 to 6), consider reducing the dose and/or frequency of dosing <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Consider reducing the dose and/or frequency of WELLBUTRIN in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (Glomerular Filtration Rate &lt;90 mL/min) <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p>

<p><span>At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and initiation of therapy with WELLBUTRIN. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping WELLBUTRIN before starting an MAOI antidepressant [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.6)].</span></p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Do not start WELLBUTRIN in a patient who is being treated with a reversible MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. Drug interactions can increase the risk of hypertensive reactions. In a patient who requires more urgent treatment of a psychiatric condition, non-pharmacological interventions, including hospitalization, should be considered <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.6)]</span>.</span></p>
<p><span>In some cases, a patient already receiving therapy with WELLBUTRIN may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of hypertensive reactions in a particular patient, WELLBUTRIN should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered. The patient should be monitored for 2 weeks or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, whichever comes first. Therapy with WELLBUTRIN may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue.</span></p>
<p><span>The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1Â mg/kg with WELLBUTRIN is unclear. The clinician should, nevertheless, be aware of the possibility of a drug interaction with such use <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.6)]</span>.</span></p>

<p>Patients with MDD, both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and/or the emergence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4092095" conceptname="Planning suicide">suicidal ideation</span> and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> is a known risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>. There has been a long-standing concern that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. </p>
<p>Pooled analyses of shortâ€‘term placeboâ€‘controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] and others) show that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with MDD and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term clinical trials did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared with placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared with placebo in adults aged 65 and older. </p>
<p>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440374" conceptname="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">obsessive compulsive disorder</span> (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 shortâ€‘term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 subjects. The pooled analyses of placeboâ€‘controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 shortâ€‘term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 subjects. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger subjects for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1,000 subjects treated) are provided in Table 1.</p>

<p>No <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>.</p>
<p>It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.</p>

Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.</p>
<p>Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patientâ€™s presenting symptoms.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for MDD or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers.

<p>WELLBUTRIN can cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span>. The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> is dose-related. The dose should not exceed 450 mg per day. Increase the dose gradually. Discontinue WELLBUTRIN and do not restart treatment if the patient experiences a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span>.</p>
<p>The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> is also related to patient factors, clinical situations, and concomitant medications that lower the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> threshold. Consider these risks before initiating treatment with WELLBUTRIN.

Additional predisposing conditions include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus treated with oral hypoglycemic drugs or insulin; use of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">anorectic</span> drugs; and excessive use of alcohol, benzodiazepines, sedative/hypnotics, or opiates.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">Seizure</span> With Bupropion Use:</span> Bupropion is associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> in approximately 0.4% (4/1,000) of patients treated at doses up to 450Â mg per day. The estimated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> incidence for WELLBUTRIN increases almost 10-fold between 450 and 600Â mg per day.</p>
<p>The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> can be reduced if the dose of WELLBUTRIN does not exceed 450Â mg per day, given as 150 mg 3 times daily, and the titration rate is gradual</p>

<p>Treatment with WELLBUTRIN can result in elevated blood pressure and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>. Assess blood pressure before initiating treatment with WELLBUTRIN, and monitor periodically during treatment. The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> is increased if WELLBUTRIN is used concomitantly with MAOIs or other drugs that increase dopaminergic or noradrenergic activity <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p>
<p>Data from a comparative trial of the sustained-release formulation of bupropion HCl, nicotine transdermal system (NTS), the combination of sustained-release bupropion plus NTS, and placebo as an aid to smoking cessation suggest a higher incidence of treatment-emergent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> in patients treated with the combination of sustained-release bupropion and NTS. In this trial, 6.1% of subjects treated with the combination of sustained-release bupropion and NTS had treatmentâ€‘emergent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> compared to 2.5%, 1.6%, and 3.1% of subjects treated with sustained-release bupropion, NTS, and placebo, respectively. The majority of these subjects had evidence of pre-existing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>. Three subjects (1.2%) treated with the combination of sustained-release bupropion and NTS and 1 subject (0.4%) treated with NTS had study medication discontinued due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> compared with none of the subjects treated with sustained-release bupropion or placebo. Monitoring of blood pressure is recommended in patients who receive the combination of bupropion and nicotine replacement.</p>
<p>In a clinical trial of bupropion immediate-release in MDD subjects with stable <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span> (N = 36), bupropion was associated with an exacerbation of pre-existing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> in 2 subjects, leading to discontinuation of bupropion treatment. There are no controlled trials assessing the safety of bupropion in patients with a recent history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> or unstable cardiac disease.</p>

The risk appears to be increased in patients with bipolar disorder or who have risk factors for bipolar disorder. Prior to initiating WELLBUTRIN, screen patients for a history of bipolar disorder and the presence of risk factors for bipolar disorder (e.g., family history of bipolar disorder, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>).

<p>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation of Treatment:</span> Adverse reactions were sufficiently troublesome to cause discontinuation of treatment with WELLBUTRIN in approximately 10% of the 2,400 subjects and healthy volunteers who participated in clinical trials during the productâ€™s initial development. The more common events causing discontinuation include neuropsychiatric disturbances (3.0%), primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span> and abnormalities in mental status; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302537" conceptname="Digestive system finding">gastrointestinal disturbances</span> (2.1%), primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>; neurological disturbances (1.7%), primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headaches</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435524" conceptname="Sleep disorder">sleep disturbances</span>; and dermatologic problems (1.4%), primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rashes</span>. It is important to note, however, that many of these events occurred at doses that exceed the recommended daily dose.</p>

<p><span class="Underline">Other Adverse Reactions Observed During the Clinical Development of WELLBUTRIN</span>: The conditions and duration of exposure to WELLBUTRIN varied greatly, and a substantial proportion of the experience was gained in open and uncontrolled clinical settings. During this experience, numerous adverse events were reported; however, without appropriate controls, it is impossible to determine with certainty which events were or were not caused by WELLBUTRIN. The following enumeration is organized by organ system and describes events in terms of their relative frequency of reporting in the database.</p>
<p>The following definitions of frequency are used: Frequent adverse reactions are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 subjects. Infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 subjects, while rare events are those occurring in less than 1/1,000 subjects.</p>

<p>â€¢CYP2B6 inducers: Dose increase may be necessary if coadministered with CYP2B6 inducers (e.g., ritonavir, lopinavir, efavirenz, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin) based on clinical response, but should not exceed the maximum recommended dose. (7.1) â€¢Drugs metabolized by CYP2D6: Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase concentrations of: antidepressants (e.g., venlafaxine, nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide). Consider dose reduction when using with bupropion. (7.2)â€¢Drugs that lower <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> threshold: Dose WELLBUTRIN with caution. (5.3, 7.3)â€¢Dopaminergic drugs (levodopa and amantadine): CNS toxicity can occur when used concomitantly with WELLBUTRIN. (7.4)â€¢MAOIs: Increased risk of hypertensive reactions can occur when used concomitantly with WELLBUTRIN. (7.6)â€¢Drug-laboratory test interactions: WELLBUTRIN can cause false-positive urine test results for amphetamines. (7.7)</p>
<p>

<p></p>
<p>Bupropion is primarily metabolized to hydroxybupropion by CYP2B6. Therefore, the potential exists for drug interactions between WELLBUTRIN and drugs that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP2B6.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Inhibitors of CYP2B6:</span><span class="Italics">Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel:</span> Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposure but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure. Based on clinical response, dosage adjustment of WELLBUTRIN may be necessary when coadministered with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Inducers of CYP2B6:</span><span class="Italics">Ritonavir, Lopinavir, and Efavirenz:</span> Concomitant treatment with these drugs can decrease bupropion and hydroxybupropion exposure. Dosage increase of WELLBUTRIN may be necessary when coadministered with ritonavir, lopinavir, or efavirenz <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] </span>but should not exceed the maximum recommended dose.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin:</span> While not systematically studied, these drugs may induce the metabolism of bupropion and may decrease bupropion exposure <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. If bupropion is used concomitantly with a CYP inducer, it may be necessary to increase the dose of bupropion, but the maximum recommended dose should not be exceeded.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6:</span> Bupropion and its metabolites (erythrohydrobupropion, threohydrobupropion, hydroxybupropion) are CYP2D6 inhibitors. Therefore, coadministration of WELLBUTRIN with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase the exposures of drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6. Such drugs include certain antidepressants (e.g., venlafaxine, nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide). When used concomitantly with WELLBUTRIN, it may be necessary to decrease the dose of these CYP2D6 substrates, particularly for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index.</p>
<p>Drugs that require metabolic activation by CYP2D6 to be effective (e.g., tamoxifen) theoretically could have reduced efficacy when administered concomitantly with inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as bupropion. Patients treated concomitantly with WELLBUTRIN and such drugs may require increased doses of the drug <span class="Italics">seeClinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Use extreme caution when coadministering WELLBUTRIN with other drugs that lower <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> threshold (e.g., other bupropion products, antipsychotics, antidepressants, theophylline, or systemic corticosteroids). Use low initial doses and increase the dose gradually <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</p>
<p>

<p>Bupropion, levodopa, and amantadine have dopamine agonist effects. CNS toxicity has been reported when bupropion was coadministered with levodopa or amantadine. Adverse reactions have included <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">restlessness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437584" conceptname="Ataxia">ataxia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437643" conceptname="Abnormal gait">gait disturbance</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439383" conceptname="Vertigo">vertigo</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>. It is presumed that the toxicity results from cumulative dopamine agonist effects. Use caution when administering WELLBUTRIN concomitantly with these drugs.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>In postmarketing experience, there have been rare reports of adverse neuropsychiatric events or reduced alcohol tolerance in patients who were drinking alcohol during treatment with WELLBUTRIN. The consumption of alcohol during treatment with WELLBUTRIN should be minimized or avoided.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bupropion inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine. Concomitant use of MAOIs and bupropion is contraindicated because there is an increased risk of hypertensive reactions if bupropion is used concomitantly with MAOIs. Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAO inhibitor phenelzine. At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and initiation of treatment with WELLBUTRIN. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping WELLBUTRIN before starting an MAOI antidepressant <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5) and Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for amphetamines have been reported in patients taking bupropion. This is due to lack of specificity of some screening tests. False-positive test results may result even following discontinuation of bupropion therapy. Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> spectrometry, will distinguish bupropion from amphetamines.</p>

<h1>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>â€¢Pregnancy: Use only if benefit outweighs potential risk to the fetus. (8.1)</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pregnancy Category C </p>
<p>Risk Summary:Data from epidemiological studies of pregnant women exposed to bupropion in the first trimester indicate no increased risk of congenital malformations overall. All pregnancies, regardless of drug exposure, have a background rate of 2% to 4% for major malformations, and 15% to 20% for pregnancy loss. No clear evidence of teratogenic activity was found in reproductive developmental studies conducted in rats and rabbits; however, in rabbits, slightly increased incidences of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079975" conceptname="Congenital malformation">fetal malformations</span> and skeletal variations were observed at doses approximately equal to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) and greater and decreased fetal weights were seen at doses twice the MRHD and greater. WELLBUTRIN should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. </p>
<p>Clinical Considerations:Consider the risks of untreated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medications during pregnancy and postpartum. </p>
<p>Human Data:Data from the international bupropion Pregnancy Registry (675 first-trimester exposures) and a retrospective cohort study using the United Healthcare database (1,213 first trimester exposures) did not show an increased risk for malformations overall.</p>
<p>No increased risk for cardiovascular malformations overall has been observed after bupropion exposure during the first trimester. The prospectively observed rate of cardiovascular malformations in pregnancies with exposure to bupropion in the first trimester from the international Pregnancy Registry was 1.3% (9 cardiovascular malformations/675 first-trimester maternal bupropion exposures), which is similar to the background rate of cardiovascular malformations (approximately 1%). Data from the United Healthcare database and a case-control study (6,853 infants with cardiovascular malformations and 5,763 with non-cardiovascular malformations) from the National <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">Birth Defects</span> Prevention Study (NBDPS) did not show an increased risk for cardiovascular malformations overall after bupropion exposure during the first trimester. </p>
<p>Study findings on bupropion exposure during the first trimester and risk for left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) are inconsistent and do not allow conclusions regarding a possible association. The United Healthcare database lacked sufficient power to evaluate this association; the NBDPS found increased risk for LVOTO (n = 10; adjusted OR = 2.6; 95% CI: 1.2, 5.7), and the Slone Epidemiology case control study did not find increased risk for LVOTO. </p>
<p>Study findings on bupropion exposure during the first trimester and risk for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434462" conceptname="Ventricular septal defect">ventricular septal defect</span> (VSD) are inconsistent and do not allow conclusions regarding a possible association. The Slone Epidemiology Study found an increased risk for VSD following first trimester maternal bupropion exposure (n = 17; adjusted OR = 2.5; 95% CI: 1.3, 5.0) but did not find increased risk for any other cardiovascular malformations studied (including LVOTO as above). The NBDPS and United Healthcare database study did not find an association between first trimester maternal bupropion exposure and VSD. </p>
<p>For the findings of LVOTO and VSD, the studies were limited by the small number of exposed cases, inconsistent findings among studies, and the potential for chance findings from multiple comparisons in case control studies. </p>
<p>Animal Data:In studies conducted in rats and rabbits, bupropion was administered orally during the period of organogenesis at doses of up to 450 and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively (approximately 11 and 7 times the MRHD, respectively, on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>basis). No clear evidence of teratogenic activity was found in either species; however, in rabbits, slightly increased incidences of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079975" conceptname="Congenital malformation">fetal malformations</span> and skeletal variations were observed at the lowest dose tested (25 mg/kg/day, approximately equal to the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis) and greater. Decreased fetal weights were observed at 50Â mg/kg and greater.</p>
<p>When rats were administered bupropion at oral doses of up to 300Â mg/kg/day (approximately 7 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>basis) prior to mating and throughout pregnancy and lactation, there were no apparent adverse effects on offspring development.</p>

<p>Bupropion and its metabolites are present in human milk. In a lactation study of 10 women, levels of orally dosed bupropion and its active metabolites were measured in expressed milk. The average daily infant exposure (assuming 150 mL/kg daily consumption) to bupropion and its active metabolites was 2% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose. Exercise caution when WELLBUTRIN is administered to a nursing woman.</p>

<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>WELLBUTRIN (bupropion hydrochloride), an antidepressant of the aminoketone class, is chemically unrelated to tricyclic, tetracyclic, selective serotonin reâ€‘uptake inhibitor, or other known antidepressant agents. Its structure closely resembles that of diethylpropion; it is related to phenylethylamines. It is designated as (Â±)-1-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-[(1,1-dimethylethyl)amino]-1-propanone hydrochloride. The molecular weight is 276.2. The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">13</span>H<span class="Sub">18</span>ClNOâ€¢HCl. Bupropion hydrochloride powder is white, crystalline, and highly soluble in water. It has a bitter taste and produces the sensation of local anesthesia on the oral mucosa. The structural formula is:</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>The exact mechanism of the antidepressant action of bupropion is not known, but is presumed to be related to noradrenergic and/or dopaminergic mechanisms. Bupropion is a relatively weak inhibitor of the neuronal reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine, and does not inhibit the reuptake of serotonin. Bupropion does not inhibit monoamine oxidase.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bupropion is a racemic mixture. The pharmacological activity and pharmacokinetics of the individual enantiomers have not been studied. The mean elimination half-life (Â±SD) of bupropion after chronic dosing is 21 (Â±9) hours, and steady-state plasma concentrations of bupropion are reached within 8Â days. </p>
<p><span class="Underline">Absorption:</span> The absolute bioavailability of WELLBUTRIN in humans has not been determined because an intravenous formulation for human use is not available. However, it appears likely that only a small proportion of any orally administered dose reaches the systemic circulation intact. In rat and dog studies, the bioavailability of bupropion ranged from 5% to 20%. </p>
<p>In humans, following oral administration of WELLBUTRIN, peak plasma bupropion concentrations are usually achieved within 2Â hours. Plasma bupropion concentrations are doseâ€‘proportional following single doses of 100 to 250Â mg; however, it is not known if the proportionality between dose and plasma level is maintained in chronic use.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Distribution:</span> In vitro tests show that bupropion is 84% bound to human plasma proteins at concentrations up to 200Â mcg/mL. The extent of protein binding of the hydroxybupropion metabolite is similar to that for bupropion, whereas the extent of protein binding of the threohydrobupropion metabolite is about half that seen with bupropion.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Metabolism:</span> Bupropion is extensively metabolized in humans. Three metabolites are active: hydroxybupropion, which is formed via hydroxylation of the <span class="Italics">tert</span>-butyl group of bupropion, and the amino-alcohol isomers threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion, which are formed via reduction of the carbonyl group. In vitro findings suggest that CYP2B6 is the principal isoenzyme involved in the formation of hydroxybupropion, while cytochrome P450 enzymes are not involved in the formation of threohydrobupropion. Oxidation of the bupropion side chain results in the formation of a glycine conjugate of meta-chlorobenzoic acid, which is then excreted as the major urinary metabolite. The potency and toxicity of the metabolites relative to bupropion have not been fully characterized. However, it has been demonstrated in an antidepressant screening test in mice that hydroxybupropion is oneâ€‘half as potent as bupropion, while threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion are 5-fold less potent than bupropion. This may be of clinical importance because the plasma concentrations of the metabolites are as high as or higher than those of bupropion.</p>
<p>Following a single dose in humans, peak plasma concentrations of hydroxybupropion occur approximately 3Â hours after administration of WELLBUTRIN and are approximately 10Â times the peak level of the parent drug at steady state. The elimination halfâ€‘life of hydroxybupropion is approximately 20Â (Â±5) hours, and its AUC at steady state is about 17Â times that of bupropion. The times to peak concentrations for the erythrohydrobupropion and threohydrobupropion metabolites are similar to that of the hydroxybupropion metabolite. However, their elimination halfâ€‘lives are longer, 33Â (Â±10) and 37Â (Â±13) hours, respectively, and steadyâ€‘state AUCs are 1.5 and 7Â times that of bupropion, respectively.</p>
<p>Bupropion and its metabolites exhibit linear kinetics following chronic administration of 300 to 450Â mg per day.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Elimination:</span> Following oral administration of 200Â mg of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-bupropion in humans, 87% and 10% of the radioactive dose were recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Only 0.5% of the oral dose was excreted as unchanged bupropion.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Population Subgroups</span>: Factors or conditions altering metabolic capacity (e.g., liver disease, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span> [CHF], age, concomitant medications, etc.) or elimination may be expected to influence the degree and extent of accumulation of the active metabolites of bupropion. The elimination of the major metabolites of bupropion may be affected by reduced renal or hepatic function because they are moderately polar compounds and are likely to undergo further metabolism or conjugation in the liver prior to urinary excretion.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal Impairment</span>:</span> There is limited information on the pharmacokinetics of bupropion in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>. An inter-trial comparison between normal subjects and subjects with end-stage <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> demonstrated that the parent drug C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values were comparable in the 2 groups, whereas the hydroxybupropion and threohydrobupropion metabolites had a 2.3- and 2.8-fold increase, respectively, in AUC for subjects with end-stage <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span>. A second trial, comparing normal subjects and subjects with moderateâ€‘toâ€‘severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (GFR 30.9  10.8 mL/min) showed that after a single 150-mg dose of sustained-release bupropion, exposure to bupropion was approximately 2-fold higher in subjects with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>, while levels of the hydroxybupropion and threo/erythrohydrobupropion (combined) metabolites were similar in the 2 groups. Bupropion is extensively metabolized in the liver to active metabolites, which are further metabolized and subsequently excreted by the kidneys. The elimination of the major metabolites of bupropion may be reduced by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>. WELLBUTRIN should be used with caution in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> and a reduced frequency and/or dose should be considered <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].</span></p>

Although not statistically significant, the AUCs for bupropion and hydroxybupropion were more variable and tended to be greater (by 53% to 57%) in volunteers with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201612" conceptname="Alcoholic liver damage">alcoholic liver disease</span>. The differences in halfâ€‘life for bupropion and the other metabolites in the 2 groups were minimal. </p>

A singleâ€‘dose pharmacokinetic trial demonstrated that the disposition of bupropion and its metabolites in elderly subjects was similar to that of younger subjects. These data suggest there is no prominent effect of age on bupropion concentration; however, another single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics trial suggested that the elderly are at increased risk for accumulation of bupropion and its metabolites <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]</span>. </p>

<p><span class="Underline">Drug Interactions:</span><span class="Italics">Potential for Other Drugs to Affect WELLBUTRIN:</span> In vitro studies indicate that bupropion is primarily metabolized to hydroxybupropion by CYP2B6. Therefore, the potential exists for drug interactions between WELLBUTRIN and drugs that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP2B6. In addition, in vitro studies suggest that paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and nelfinavir inhibit the hydroxylation of bupropion. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Inhibitors of CYP2B6: Ticlopidine, Clopidogrel:</span> In a trial in healthy male volunteers, clopidogrel 75 mg once daily or ticlopidine 250 mg twice daily increased exposures (C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC) of bupropion by 40% and 60% for clopidogrel, and by 38% and 85% for ticlopidine, respectively. The exposures (C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC) of hydroxybupropion were decreased 50% and 52%, respectively, by clopidogrel, and 78% and 84%, respectively, by ticlopidine. This effect is thought to be due to the inhibition of the CYP2B6-catalyzed bupropion hydroxylation. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Prasugrel:</span> Prasugrel is a weak inhibitor of CYP2B6. In healthy subjects, prasugrel increased bupropion C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values by 14% and 18%, respectively, and decreased C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values of hydroxybupropion, an active metabolite of bupropion, by 32% and 24%, respectively.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Cimetidine:</span> The threohydrobupropion metabolite of bupropion does not appear to be produced by cytochrome P450 enzymes. The effects of concomitant administration of cimetidine on the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and its active metabolites were studied in 24 healthy young male volunteers. Following oral administration of bupropion 300Â mg with and without cimetidine 800Â mg, the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and hydroxybupropion were unaffected. However, there were 16% and 32% increases in the AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span>, respectively of the combined moieties of threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Citalopram:</span> Citalopram did not affect the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and its three metabolites.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Inducers of CYP2B6: Ritonavir and Lopinavir: </span>In a healthy volunteer trial, ritonavir 100Â mg twice daily reduced the AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of bupropion by 22% and 21%, respectively. The exposure of the hydroxybupropion metabolite was decreased by 23%, the threohydrobupropion decreased by 38%, and the erythrohydrobupropion decreased by 48%. In a second healthy volunteer trial, ritonavir 600Â mg twice daily decreased the AUC and the C<span class="Sub">max</span> of bupropion by 66% and 62%, respectively. The exposure of the hydroxybupropion metabolite was decreased by 78%, the threohydrobupropion decreased by 50%, and the erythrohydrobupropion decreased by 68%. </p>
<p>In another healthy volunteer trial, lopinavir 400Â mg/ritonavir 100Â mg twice daily decreased bupropion AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 57%. The AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of hydroxybupropion were decreased by 50% and 31%, respectively.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Efavirenz</span>: In a trial in healthy volunteers, efavirenz 600Â mg once daily for 2Â weeks reduced the AUC and C<span class="Sub">max </span>of bupropion by approximately 55% and 34%, respectively. The AUC of hydroxybupropion was unchanged, whereas C<span class="Sub">max </span>of hydroxybupropion was increased by 50%.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin: </span>While not systematically studied, these drugs may induce the metabolism of bupropion.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p><span class="Underline">Potential for WELLBUTRIN to Affect Other Drugs</span></p>
<p>: Animal data indicated that bupropion may be an inducer of drug-metabolizing enzymes in humans. In one trial, following chronic administration of bupropion 100Â mg three times daily to 8 healthy male volunteers for 14 days, there was no evidence of induction of its own metabolism. Nevertheless, there may be potential for clinically important alterations of blood levels of co-administered drugs. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6</span>: In vitro, bupropion and its metabolites (erythrohydrobupropion, threohydrobupropion, hydroxybupropion) are CYP2D6 inhibitors. In a clinical trial of 15 male subjects (ages 19 to 35 years) who were extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6, bupropion 300Â mg per day followed by a single dose of 50Â mg desipramine increased the C<span class="Sub">max</span>, AUC, and t<span class="Sub">1/2 </span>of desipramine by an average of approximately 2-, 5-, and 2-fold, respectively. The effect was present for at least 7 days after the last dose of bupropion. Concomitant use of bupropion with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 has not been formally studied.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Citalopram:</span> Although citalopram is not primarily metabolized by CYP2D6, in one trial bupropion increased the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of citalopram by 30% and 40%, respectively.</p>
<p>Lamotrigine: Multiple oral doses of bupropion had no statistically significant effects on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine in 12 healthy volunteers.</p>

<h1>NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Lifetime carcinogenicity studies were performed in rats and mice at bupropion doses up to 300 and 150Â mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are approximately 7 and 2 times the MRHD, respectively, on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. In the rat study there was an increase in nodular proliferative lesions of the liver at doses of 100 to 300Â mg/kg/day (approximately 2 to 7 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis); lower doses were not tested. The question of whether or not such lesions may be precursors of neoplasms of the liver is currently unresolved. Similar liver lesions were not seen in the mouse study, and no increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197506" conceptname="Malignant neoplasm of abdomen">malignant tumors</span> of the liver and other organs was seen in either study.</p>
<p>Bupropion produced a positive response (2 to 3 times control mutation rate) in 2 of 5 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay. Bupropion produced an increase in chromosomal aberrations in 1 of 3 in vivo rat bone marrow cytogenetic studies. </p>
<p>A fertility study in rats at doses up to 300 mg/kg/day revealed no evidence of impaired fertility.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>The efficacy of WELLBUTRIN in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> was established in two 4â€‘week, placeboâ€‘controlled trials in adult inpatients with MDD (Trials 1 and 2 in Table 4) and in one 6â€‘week, placeboâ€‘controlled trial in adult outpatients with MDD (Trial 3 in Table 4). In the first trial, the dose range of WELLBUTRIN was 300Â mg to 600Â mg per day administered in 3Â divided doses; 78% of subjects were treated with doses of 300Â mg to 450Â mg per day. The trial demonstrated the efficacy of WELLBUTRIN as measured by the Hamilton <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> Rating Scale (HDRS) total score, the HDRS <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="40546087" conceptname="Depressed mood">depressed mood</span> item (item 1), and the Clinical Global Impressions-severity score (CGI-S). The second trial included 2 doses of WELLBUTRIN (300 and 450Â mg per day) and placebo. This trial demonstrated the effectiveness of WELLBUTRIN for only the 450â€‘mg-per-day dose. The efficacy results were statistically significant for the HDRS total score and the CGI-S score, but not for HDRS item 1. In the third trial, outpatients were treated with 300Â mg per day of WELLBUTRIN. This trial demonstrated the efficacy of WELLBUTRIN as measured by the HDRS total score, the HDRS item 1, the Montgomeryâ€‘Asberg <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> Rating Scale (MADRS), the CGI-S score, and the CGI-Improvement Scale (CGI-I) score. Effectiveness of WELLBUTRIN in longâ€‘term use, that is, for more than 6Â weeks, has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials.</p>

Instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.Advise patients regarding the following issues and to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking WELLBUTRIN.</p>
<p>Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors: Instruct patients, their families, and/or their caregivers to be alert to the emergence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021498" conceptname="Panic attack">panic attacks</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4195585" conceptname="Hostile behavior">hostility</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021344" conceptname="Abusive behavior">aggressiveness</span>, impulsivity, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4108925" conceptname="Akathisia">akathisia</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">psychomotor restlessness</span>), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333678" conceptname="Hypomania">hypomania</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">mania</span>, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4092095" conceptname="Planning suicide">suicidal ideation</span>, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Advise families and caregivers of patients to observe for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patientâ€™s prescriber or healthcare professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patientâ€™s presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication.</p>
<p>Neuropsychiatric Symptoms and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> Risk in Smoking Cessation Treatment: Although WELLBUTRIN is not indicated for smoking cessation treatment, it contains the same active ingredient as ZYBAN<span class="Sup">Â®</span> which is approved for this use.

<p>Severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">Allergic Reactions</span>: Educate patients on the symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> and to discontinue WELLBUTRIN if they have a severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergic reaction</span>.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">Seizure</span>: Instruct patients to discontinue and not restart WELLBUTRIN if they experience a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> while on treatment. Advise patients that the excessive use or abrupt discontinuation of alcohol, benzodiazepines, antiepileptic drugs, or sedatives/hypnotics can increase the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span>. Advise patients to minimize or avoid use of alcohol. </p>
<p>Bupropion-Containing Products: Educate patients that WELLBUTRIN contains the same active ingredient (bupropion hydrochloride) found in ZYBAN, which is used as an aid to smoking cessation treatment, and that WELLBUTRIN should not be used in combination with ZYBAN or any other medications that contain bupropion (such as WELLBUTRIN SR<span class="Sup">Â®</span>, the sustained-release formulation and WELLBUTRIN XL<span class="Sup">Â®</span> or FORFIVO XLâ„¢, the extended-release formulations, and APLENZIN<span class="Sup">Â®</span>, the extended-release formulation of bupropion hydrobromide). In addition, there are a number of generic bupropion HCl products for the immediate-, sustained-, and extended-release formulations.</p>
<p>Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment: Advise patients that any CNSâ€‘active drug like WELLBUTRIN may impair their ability to perform tasks requiring judgment or motor and cognitive skills. Advise patients that until they are reasonably certain that WELLBUTRIN does not adversely affect their performance, they should refrain from driving an automobile or operating complex, hazardous machinery. WELLBUTRIN may lead to decreased alcohol tolerance.</p>
<p>Concomitant Medications: Counsel patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are taking or plan to take any prescription or overâ€‘theâ€‘counter drugs because WELLBUTRIN and other drugs may affect each othersâ€™ metabolisms.</p>
<p>Pregnancy: Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy.</p>
<p>Precautions for Nursing Mothers: Advise patients that WELLBUTRIN is present in human milk in small amounts.</p>
<p>Storage Information: Instruct patients to store WELLBUTRIN at room temperature, between 59Â°F and 86Â°F (15Â°C to 30Â°C) and keep the tablets dry and out of the light.</p>
<p>Administration Information: Instruct patients to take WELLBUTRIN in equally divided doses 3 or 4Â times a day, with doses separated by least 6 hours to minimize the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span>. Instruct patients if they miss a dose, not to take an extra tablet to make up for the missed dose and to take the next tablet at the regular time because of the dose-related risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span>. Instruct patients that WELLBUTRIN Tablets should be swallowed whole and not crushed, divided, or chewed. WELLBUTRIN can be taken with or without food.</p>
