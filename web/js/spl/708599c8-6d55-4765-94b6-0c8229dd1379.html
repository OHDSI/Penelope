<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Phenytoin is an antiepileptic drug.</p>
<p>Phenytoin is related to the barbiturates in chemical structure, but has a five-membered ring. The chemical name is 5,5-Diphenylhydantoin, having the following structural formula:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="Structural Formula" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=708599c8-6d55-4765-94b6-0c8229dd1379&amp;name=phenytoin-chewable-tabs-1.jpg"></div>
<p>Each phenytoin chewable tablet, USP for oral administration, contains 50 mg of phenytoin, USP. Also contains: colloidal silicon dioxide, compressible sugar, corn starch, D&amp;C Red No. 30 Aluminum Lake, magnesium stearate, peppermint flavor and talc.</p>

<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Phenytoin is an antiepileptic drug which can be useful in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>. The primary site of action appears to be the <span class="Italics">motor cortex</span> where spread of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> activity is inhibited. Possibly by promoting sodium efflux from neurons, phenytoin tends to <span class="Italics">stabilize</span> the threshold against <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">hyperexcitability</span> caused by excessive stimulation or environmental changes capable of reducing membrane sodium gradient. This includes the reduction of posttetanic potentiation at synapses. Loss of posttetanic potentiation prevents cortical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> foci from detonating adjacent cortical areas. Phenytoin reduces the maximal activity of brain stem centers responsible for the tonic phase of tonic-clonic (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="374924" conceptname="Generalized convulsive epilepsy">grand mal</span>) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies using phenytoin chewable tablets have shown an average plasma half-life of 14 hours with a range of 7 to 29 hours. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day.</p>
<p>When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance and are obtained just prior to the patientâ€™s next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individualâ€™s threshold for emergence of dose related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. For phenytoin chewable tablets, peak levels occur 1.5 to 3 hours after administration.</p>
<p>Optimum control without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum levels between 10 and 20 mcg/mL, although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="374924" conceptname="Generalized convulsive epilepsy">grand mal</span>) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin.</p>
<p>In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin plasma levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal.</p>
<p>Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high plasma levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more.</p>
<p>Clinical studies show that chewed and unchewed phenytoin chewable tablets are bioequivalent, yield approximately equivalent plasma levels, and are more rapidly absorbed than 100 mg Dilantin Kapseals<span class="Sup">Â®</span>*.</p>

<h2>Effects of Abrupt Withdrawal</h2>
<p class="First">Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span>. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative antiepileptic medication arises, this should be done gradually. In the event of an allergic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reaction</span>, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322252" conceptname="Suicidal behavior">Suicidal Behavior</span> and Ideation</h2>
<p class="First">Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including phenytoin chewable tablets, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</p>
<p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322252" conceptname="Suicidal behavior">suicidal behavior</span> or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>.</p>
<p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</p>
<p> The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.</p>
<p>Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</p>

<p>The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> and psychiatric indications.</p>
<p>Anyone considering prescribing phenytoin chewable tablets or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">Epilepsy</span> and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.</p>
<p>Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm.

<h2>Serious Dermatologic Reactions</h2>
<p class="First">Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443754" conceptname="Lyell's toxic epidermal necrolysis, subepidermal type">toxic epidermal necrolysis</span> (TEN) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="141651" conceptname="Stevens-Johnson syndrome">Stevens-Johnson Syndrome</span> (SJS), have been reported with phenytoin treatment. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin should be discontinued at the first sign of a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>, unless the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of Drug Reaction with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302954" conceptname="Disorder characterized by eosinophilia">Eosinophilia</span> and Systemic Symptoms (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_923d9322-4840-4493-96a8-2469918c3b22">DRESS/Multiorgan <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">Hypersensitivity</span></a></span> below).</p>
<p> Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. Consideration should be given to avoiding phenytoin as an alternative for carbamazepine in patients positive for HLA-B*1502.</p>
<p> The use of HLA-B*1502 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied.</p>

<h4><span class="Bold">Risks to the Fetus</span></h4>
<p class="First">Â  If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking the drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus.</p>
<p>Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), minor anomalies (dysmorphic facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia), growth abnormalities (including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381114" conceptname="Microcephalus">microcephaly</span>), and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440389" conceptname="Mental retardation">mental deficiency</span> have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have also been several reported cases of malignancies, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333766" conceptname="Neuroblastoma">neuroblastoma</span>, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. The overall incidence of malformations for children of epileptic women treated with antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin and/or others) during pregnancy is about 10%, or 2- to 3-fold that in the general population. However, the relative contributions of antiepileptic drugs and other factors associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> to this increased risk are uncertain and in most cases it has not been possible to attribute specific developmental abnormalities to particular antiepileptic drugs.</p>
<p>Patients should consult with their physicians to weigh the risks and benefits of phenytoin during pregnancy.</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4326594" conceptname="Abnormal liver function">impaired liver function</span>, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity.</p>
<p>A small percentage of individuals who have been treated with phenytoin have been shown to metabolize the drug slowly. Slow metabolism may be due to limited enzyme availability and lack of induction; it appears to be genetically determined. If early signs of dose related CNS toxicity develop, plasma levels should be checked immediately.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">Hyperglycemia</span>, resulting from the drugâ€™s inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients.</p>
<p>Phenytoin is not indicated for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> due to hypoglycemic or other metabolic causes. Appropriate diagnostic procedures should be performed as indicated.</p>

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Inform patients of the availability of a Medication Guide, and instruct them to read the Medication Guide prior to taking phenytoin. Instruct patients to take phenytoin only as prescribed.</p>
<p>Patients taking phenytoin should be advised of the importance of adhering strictly to the prescribed dosage regimen, and of informing the physician of any clinical condition in which it is not possible to take the drug orally as prescribed, e.g., surgery, etc.</p>
<p>Patients should be made aware of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span>, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="26711" conceptname="Chronic pharyngitis">sore throat</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcers</span> in the mouth, easy <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441737" conceptname="Contusion">bruising</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315085" conceptname="Lymphadenopathy">lymphadenopathy</span> and petechial or purpuric <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">hemorrhage</span>, and in the case of liver reactions, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">anorexia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span>. The patient should be advised that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, the patient should be advised that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use.</p>
<p>Patients should also be cautioned on the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking the physicianâ€™s advice.</p>
<p>The importance of good dental hygiene should be stressed in order to minimize the development of gingival <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4296894" conceptname="Hyperplasia">hyperplasia</span> and its complications.</p>
<p>Patients, their caregivers, and families should be counseled that AEDs, including phenytoin chewable tablets, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.</p>
<p>Patients should be encouraged to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. To enroll, patients can call the toll free number 1-888-233-2334 (see <a href="#LINK_6720710b-c5fb-4312-be98-b09cb2b242c2">PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy section</a>).</p>

<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">Phenytoin serum level determinations may be necessary to achieve optimal dosage adjustments. Phenytoin doses are usually selected to attain therapeutic plasma total phenytoin concentrations of 10 to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL).</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">drug toxicity</span>. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Serum level determinations for phenytoin are especially helpful when possible drug interactions are suspected. </p>
<p>The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: </p>
<p>Note: The list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Drugs that affect phenytoin concentrations: </span></span></p>
<ul class="Disk">
<li>â€¢Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels, include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, anti-epileptic agents (ethosuximide,felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate), azoles (fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), capecitabine, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, disulfiram, estrogens, fluorouracil, fluoxetine, fluvastatin, fluvoxamine, H<span class="Sub">2</span>-antagonists (e.g., cimetidine), halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, omeprazole, phenothiazines, salicylates, sertraline, succinimides, sulfonamides (e.g., sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim), ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, and warfarin. </li>
<li>â€¢Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels, include: anticancer drugs usually in combination (e.g., bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate), carbamazepine, chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433753" conceptname="Alcohol abuse">alcohol abuse</span>, folic acid, fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, reserpine, ritonavir, St. Johnâ€™s Wort, sucralfate and vigabatrin. </li>
<li>â€¢Administration of phenytoin with preparations that increase gastric pH (e.g., supplements or antacids containing calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, and magnesium hydroxide) may affect the absorption of phenytoin. In most cases where interactions were seen, the effect is a decrease in phenytoin levels when the drugs are taken at the same time. When possible, phenytoin and these products should not be taken at the same time of day.</li>
<li>â€¢Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels, include: phenobarbital, sodium valproate, and valproic acid. Similarly, the effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid, and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable. </li>
<li>â€¢The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Drugs affected by phenytoin: </span></span></p>
<ul class="Disk">
<li>â€¢Drugs that should not be coadministered with phenytoin: delavirdine (see <a href="#LINK_fdae81c3-b5f0-4e88-b642-afe11409e887">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>).</li>
<li>â€¢Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin include: azoles, (fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole), corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, irinotecan, oral contraceptives, paclitaxel, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, teniposide, theophylline, and vitamin D.</li>
<li>â€¢Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin. </li>
<li>â€¢Phenytoin decreases plasma concentrations of active metabolites of albendazole certain HIV antivirals (efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir), anti-epileptic agents (felbamate, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, quetiapine), atorvastatin, cyclosporine, digoxin, fluvastatin, folic acid, mexiletine, nisoldipine, praziquantel, and simvastatin.</li>
<li>â€¢Phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir. </li>
<li>â€¢Resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents pancuronium, vecuronium, rocuronium, and cisatracurium has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">neuromuscular blockade</span> than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher.</li>

<p>There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin plasma levels where toxicity may occur. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378165" conceptname="Nystagmus">Nystagmus</span> on lateral gaze usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437584" conceptname="Ataxia">ataxia</span> at 30 mcg/mL; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196636" conceptname="Dysarthria">dysarthria</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4061577" conceptname="Lethargy">lethargy</span> appear when the plasma concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity.

<h2>Treatment</h2>
<p class="First">Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote.</p>
<p>The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> in pediatric patients. </p>
<p>In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">When given in equal doses, phenytoin chewable tablets yield higher plasma levels than Dilantin Kapseals<span class="Sup">Â®</span>*. For this reason serum concentrations should be monitored and care should be taken when switching a patient from the sodium salt to the free acid form.</p>
<p>Dilantin Kapseals<span class="Sup">Â®</span>* is formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. The free acid form of phenytoin is used in Dilantin-125<span class="Sup">Â®</span> Suspensions* and phenytoin chewable tablets. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa.</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Not for once-a-day dosing.</p>
<p>Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments - the clinically effective serum level is usually 10 to 20 mcg/mL. With recommended dosage, a period of 7 to 10 days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than 7 to 10 days.</p>
<p>Phenytoin chewable tablets can be either chewed thoroughly before being swallowed or swallowed whole.</p>

<h2>Adult Dosage</h2>
<p class="First">Patients who have received no previous treatment may be started on two phenytoin chewable tablets 3 times daily, and the dose is then adjusted to suit individual requirements. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be six to eight phenytoin chewable tablets daily; an increase to twelve phenytoin chewable tablets daily may be made, if necessary.</p>
