<h1>WARNING</h1>
<p class="First">Only physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and management of organ transplant patients should prescribe cyclosporine capsules, (NON-MODIFIED). Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient.</p>
<p>Cyclosporine capsules, (NON-MODIFIED) should be administered with adrenal corticosteroids but not with other immunosuppressive agents. Increased susceptibility to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> and the possible development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> may result from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242843" conceptname="Immunosuppression">immunosuppression</span>.</p>
<p>Cyclosporine capsules, (NON-MODIFIED) have decreased bioavailability in comparison to Neoral<span class="Sup">®</span>* (cyclosporine capsules, USP) MODIFIED.</p>
<p>Cyclosporine capsules, (NON-MODIFIED) and Neoral<span class="Sup">®</span>* (cyclosporine capsules, USP) MODIFIED are not bioequivalent and cannot be used interchangeably without physician supervision.</p>
<p>The absorption of cyclosporine during chronic administration of cyclosporine capsules, USP (NON-MODIFIED) was found to be erratic. It is recommended that patients taking cyclosporine capsules,  (NON-MODIFIED) over a period of time be monitored at repeated intervals for cyclosporine blood concentrations and subsequent dose adjustments be made in order to avoid toxicity due to high concentrations and possible organ rejection due to low absorption of cyclosporine. This is of special importance in liver transplants. Numerous assays are being developed to measure blood concentrations of cyclosporine. Comparison of concentrations in published literature to patient concentrations using current assays must be done with detailed knowledge of the assay methods employed.

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Cyclosporine capsules is a potent immunosuppressive agent which in animals prolongs survival of allogeneic transplants involving skin, heart, kidney, pancreas, bone marrow, small intestine, and lung. Cyclosporine capsules has been demonstrated to suppress some humoral immunity and to a greater extent, cell-mediated reactions such as allograft rejection, delayed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span>, experimental allergic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373189" conceptname="Encephalomyelitis">encephalomyelitis</span>, Freund's adjuvant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4291025" conceptname="Arthritis">arthritis</span>, and graft vs. host disease in many animal species for a variety of organs.</p>
<p>Successful kidney, liver, and heart allogeneic transplants have been performed in man using cyclosporine capsules. </p>
<p>The exact mechanism of action of cyclosporine capsules is not known. Experimental evidence suggests that the effectiveness of cyclosporine is due to specific and reversible inhibition of immunocompetent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span> in the G<span class="Sub">0</span>- or G<span class="Sub">1</span>-phase of the cell cycle. T-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span> are preferentially inhibited. The T-helper cell is the main target, although the T-suppressor cell may also be suppressed. Cyclosporine capsules also inhibits lymphokine production and release including interleukin-2 or T-cell growth factor (TCGF).</p>
<p>No functional effects on phagocytic (changes in enzyme secretions not altered, chemotactic migration of granulocytes, macrophage migration, carbon clearance <span class="Italics">in vivo</span>) or tumor cells (growth rate, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4147162" conceptname="Secondary malignant neoplasm of respiratory and digestive systems">metastasis</span>) can be detected in animals. Cyclosporine capsules does not cause bone marrow suppression in animal models or man. </p>
<p>The absorption of cyclosporine from the gastrointestinal tract is incomplete and variable. Peak concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) in blood and plasma are achieved at about 3.5 hours. C<span class="Sub">max</span> and area under the plasma or blood concentration/time curve (AUC) increase with the administered dose; for blood, the relationship is curvilinear (parabolic) between 0 and 1400 mg. As determined by a specific assay, C<span class="Sub">max</span> is approximately 1.0 ng/mL/mg of dose for plasma and 2.7 to 1.4 ng/mL/mg of dose for blood (for low to high doses). </p>
<p>Cyclosporine is distributed largely outside the blood volume. In blood, the distribution is concentration dependent. Approximately 33% to 47% is in plasma, 4% to 9% in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span>, 5% to 12% in granulocytes, and 41% to 58% in erythrocytes. At high concentrations, the uptake by leukocytes and erythrocytes becomes saturated. In plasma, approximately 90% is bound to proteins, primarily lipoproteins.</p>
<p>The disposition of cyclosporine from blood is biphasic with a terminal half-life of approximately 19 hours (range: 10 to 27 hours). Elimination is primarily biliary with only 6% of the dose excreted in the urine.</p>
<p>Cyclosporine is extensively metabolized but there is no major metabolic pathway. Only 0.1% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Of 15 metabolites characterized in human urine, 9 have been assigned structures. The major pathways consist of hydroxylation of the Cγ-carbon of 2 of the leucine residues, Cη-carbon hydroxylation, and cyclic ether formation (with oxidation of the double bond) in the side chain of the amino acid 3-hydroxyl-<span class="Italics">N</span>,4-dimethyl-L-2-amino-6-octenoic acid and <span class="Italics">N</span>-demethylation of <span class="Italics">N</span>-methyl leucine residues. Hydrolysis of the cyclic peptide chain or conjugation of the aforementioned metabolites do not appear to be important biotransformation pathways.</p>

<p>In a study performed in 4 subjects with end-stage <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span> (creatinine clearance &lt; 5 mL/min), an intravenous infusion of 3.5 mg/kg of cyclosporine over 4 hours administered at the end of a hemodialysis session resulted in a mean volume of distribution (Vdss) of 3.49 L/kg and systemic clearance (CL) of 0.369 L/hr/kg. This systemic CL (0.369 L/hr/kg) was approximately two thirds of the mean systemic CL (0.56 L/hr/kg) of cyclosporine in historical control subjects with normal renal function. In 5 liver transplant patients, the mean clearance of cyclosporine on and off hemodialysis was 463 mL/min and 398 mL/min, respectively. Less than 1% of the dose of cyclosporine was recovered in the dialysate. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic Impairment</span></span></span></p>
<p>Cyclosporine is extensively metabolized by the liver. Since severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> may result in significantly increased cyclosporine exposures, the dosage of cyclosporine may need to be reduced in these patients.</p>

<p class="First">It is not unusual for serum creatinine and BUN levels to be elevated during cyclosporine capsules therapy. These elevations in renal transplant patients do not necessarily indicate rejection, and each patient must be fully evaluated before dosage adjustment is initiated.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126119" conceptname="Toxic nephropathy">Nephrotoxicity</span> has been noted in 25% of cases of renal transplantation, 38% of cases of cardiac transplantation, and 37% of cases of liver transplantation. Mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126119" conceptname="Toxic nephropathy">nephrotoxicity</span> was generally noted 2 to 3 months after transplant and consisted of an arrest in the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> of the preoperative elevations of BUN and creatinine at a range of 35 to 45 mg/dl and 2.0 to 2.5 mg/dl, respectively. These elevations were often responsive to dosage reduction.</p>
<p>More overt <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126119" conceptname="Toxic nephropathy">nephrotoxicity</span> was seen early after transplantation and was characterized by a rapidly rising BUN and creatinine. Since these events are similar to rejection episodes, care must be taken to differentiate between them. This form of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126119" conceptname="Toxic nephropathy">nephrotoxicity</span> is usually responsive to cyclosporine capsules dosage reduction.</p>
<p>Although specific diagnostic criteria which reliably differentiate renal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4248020" conceptname="Graft rejection">graft rejection</span> from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">drug toxicity</span> have not been found, a number of parameters have been significantly associated to one or the other. It should be noted however, that up to 20% of patients may have simultaneous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126119" conceptname="Toxic nephropathy">nephrotoxicity</span> and rejection.</p>

<p>A form of chronic progressive cyclosporine-associated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126119" conceptname="Toxic nephropathy">nephrotoxicity</span> is characterized by serial deterioration in renal function and morphologic changes in the kidneys. From 5% to 15% of transplant recipients will fail to show a reduction in a rising serum creatinine despite a decrease or discontinuation of cyclosporine therapy. Renal biopsies from these patients will demonstrate an interstitial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012171" conceptname="Fibrosis">fibrosis</span> with tubular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4028206" conceptname="Atrophy">atrophy</span>. In addition, toxic tubulopathy, peritubular capillary congestion, arteriolopathy, and a striped form of interstitial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012171" conceptname="Fibrosis">fibrosis</span> with tubular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4028206" conceptname="Atrophy">atrophy</span> may be present. Though none of these morphologic changes is entirely specific, a histologic diagnosis of chronic progressive cyclosporine-associated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126119" conceptname="Toxic nephropathy">nephrotoxicity</span> requires evidence of these.</p>
<p>When considering the development of chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126119" conceptname="Toxic nephropathy">nephrotoxicity</span> it is noteworthy that several authors have reported an association between the appearance of interstitial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012171" conceptname="Fibrosis">fibrosis</span> and higher cumulative doses or persistently high circulating trough concentrations of cyclosporine. This is particularly true during the first 6 posttransplant months when the dosage tends to be highest and when, in kidney recipients, the organ appears to be most vulnerable to the toxic effects of cyclosporine. Among other contributing factors to the development of interstitial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012171" conceptname="Fibrosis">fibrosis</span> in these patients must be included, prolonged perfusion time, warm <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4200991" conceptname="Ischemia">ischemia</span> time, as well as episodes of acute toxicity, and acute and chronic rejection. The reversibility of interstitial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012171" conceptname="Fibrosis">fibrosis</span> and its correlation to renal function have not yet been determined.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Impaired renal function</span> at any time requires close monitoring, and frequent dosage adjustment may be indicated. In patients with persistent high elevations of BUN and creatinine who are unresponsive to dosage adjustments, consideration should be given to switching to other immunosuppressive therapy. In the event of severe and unremitting rejection, it is preferable to allow the kidney transplant to be rejected and removed rather than increase the cyclosporine capsules dosage to a very high level in an attempt to reverse the rejection.</p>
<p>Due to the potential for additive or synergistic impairment of renal function, caution should be exercised when co-administering cyclosporine capsules with other drugs that may impair renal function (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#_EBBE3D69-9FF9-DE45-A539-124EEA8F4CF5">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</a></span>).</p>

<p>During the concomitant use of a drug that may exhibit additive or synergistic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> potential with cyclosporine, close monitoring of renal function (in particular serum creatinine) should be performed. If a significant impairment of renal function occurs, reduction in the dosage of cyclosporine and/or co-administered drug or an alternative treatment should be considered.</p>
<p>Cyclosporine is extensively metabolized by CYP 3A isoenzymes, in particular CYP3A4, and is a substrate of the multidrug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein. Various agents are known to either increase or decrease plasma or whole blood concentrations of cyclosporine usually by inhibition or induction of CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein transporter or both. Compounds that decrease cyclosporine absorption such as orlistat should be avoided. Appropriate cyclosporine capsules dosage adjustment to achieve the desired cyclosporine concentrations is essential when drugs that significantly alter cyclosporine concentrations are used concomitantly (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#_F65A1053-28D4-A010-0DA7-8E528648E712">Blood Concentration Monitoring</a></span>).</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">B.  Effect of Cyclosporine on the Pharmacokinetics and/or Safety of Other Drugs or Agents</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">Cyclosporine is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and of multidrug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein and may increase plasma concentrations of comedications that are substrates of CYP3A4, P-glycoprotein, or both.</p>
<p>Cyclosporine may reduce the clearance of digoxin, colchicine, prednisolone, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and aliskiren, repaglinide, NSAIDs, sirolimus, etoposide, and other drugs. </p>
<p>See the full prescribing information of the other drug for further information and specific recommendations. The decision on coadministration of cyclosporine with other drugs or agents should be made by the physician following the careful assessment of benefits and risks. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Digoxin</span></p>
<p>Severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">digitalis toxicity</span> has been seen within days of starting cyclosporine in several patients taking digoxin. If digoxin is used concurrently with cyclosporine, serum digoxin concentrations should be monitored.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Colchicine</span></p>
<p>There are reports on the potential of cyclosporine to enhance the toxic effects of colchicine such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137275" conceptname="Disorder of muscle">myopathy</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197608" conceptname="Peripheral neuritis in pregnancy">neuropathy</span>, especially in patients with renal dysfunction. Concomitant administration of cyclosporine and colchicine results in significant increases in colchicine plasma concentrations. If colchicine is used concurrently with cyclosporine, a reduction in the dosage of colchicine is recommended.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors (statins)</span></p>

When concurrently administered with cyclosporine, the dosage of these statins should be reduced according to label recommendations. Statin therapy needs to be temporarily withheld or discontinued in patients with signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137275" conceptname="Disorder of muscle">myopathy</span> or those with risk factors predisposing to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4220631" conceptname="Injury of kidney">renal injury</span>, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span>, secondary to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4230337" conceptname="Rhabdomyolysis">rhabdomyolysis</span>. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Repaglinide</span></p>
<p>Cyclosporine may increase the plasma concentrations of repaglinide and thereby increase the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. In 12 healthy male subjects who received two doses of 100 mg cyclosporine capsule orally 12 hours apart with a single dose of 0.25 mg repaglinide tablet (one half of a 0.5 mg tablet) orally 13 hours after the cyclosporine initial dose, the repaglinide mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC were increased 1.8 fold (range: 0.6 to 3.7 fold) and 2.4 fold (range 1.2 to 5.3 fold), respectively. Close monitoring of blood glucose level is advisable for a patient taking cyclosporine and repaglinide concomitantly. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Ambrisentan</span></p>
<p>Co-administration of ambrisentan (5 mg daily) and cyclosporine (100 to 150 mg twice daily initially, then dosing to achieve C<span class="Sub">min</span> 150 to 200 ng/mL) for 8 days in healthy subjects resulted mean increases in ambrisentan AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of approximately 2-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively, compared to ambrisentan alone. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Anthracycline</span> antibiotics</p>
<p>High doses of cyclosporine (e.g., at starting intravenous dose of 16 mg/kg/day) may increase the exposure to anthracycline antibiotics (e.g., doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, daunorubicin) in cancer patients.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Aliskiren</span></p>
<p>Cyclosporine alters the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren, a substrate of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4. In 14 healthy subjects who received concomitantly single doses of cyclosporine (200 mg) and reduced dose aliskiren (75 mg), the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> of aliskiren was increased by approximately 2.5-fold (90% CI: 1.96 to 3.17) and the mean AUC by approximately 4.3 fold (90% CI: 3.52  to 5.21), compared to when these subjects received aliskiren alone. The concomitant administration of aliskiren with cyclosporine prolonged the median aliskiren elimination half-life (26 hours versus 43 to 45 hours) and the T<span class="Sub">max</span> (0.5 hours versus 1.5 to 2.0 hours). The mean AUC and C<span class="Sub">max </span>of cyclosporine were comparable to reported literature values. Co-administration of cyclosporine and aliskiren in these subjects also resulted in an increase in the number and/or intensity of adverse events, mainly <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113666" conceptname="Menopausal flushing">hot flush</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>. The co-administration of cyclosporine with aliskiren is not recommended.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Bosentan</span></p>
<p>In healthy subjects, co-administration of bosentan and cyclosporine resulted in mean increases in dose-normalized bosentan trough concentrations on day 1 and day 8 of approximately 21-fold and 2-fold, respectively, compared to when bosentan was given alone as a single dose on day 1 (see also <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID_ffe86911-a84b-4629-bd2e-d0e559139fe1">Effect of Drugs and Other Agents on Cyclosporine Pharmacokinetics and/or Safety</a></span>). </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Potassium sparing diuretics</span></p>
<p>Cyclosporine should not be used with potassium-sparing diuretics because <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span> can occur. Caution is also required when cyclosporine is coadministered with potassium-sparing drugs (e.g., angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists), potassium-containing drugs as well as in patients on a potassium-rich diet. Control of potassium levels in these situations is advisable.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug (NSAID) Interactions </span></p>
<p>Clinical status and serum creatinine should be closely monitored when cyclosporine is used with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> patients (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#_CAE1E13A-FA89-B1AC-BC5C-99E4CCF72E5F">WARNINGS</a></span>).</p>

Although concomitant administration of diclofenac does not affect blood concentrations of cyclosporine, it has been associated with approximate doubling of diclofenac blood levels and occasional reports of reversible decreases in renal function. Consequently, the dose of diclofenac should be in the lower end of the therapeutic range.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Methotrexate Interaction</span></p>
<p>Preliminary data indicate that when methotrexate and cyclosporine were coadministered to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> patients (N=20), methotrexate concentrations (AUCs) were increased approximately 30% and the concentrations (AUCs) of its metabolite, 7-hydroxy methotrexate, were decreased by approximately 80%. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. Cyclosporine concentrations do not appear to have been altered (N=6).</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Sirolimus</span></p>
<p>Elevations in serum creatinine were observed in studies using sirolimus in combination with full-dose cyclosporine. This effect is often reversible with cyclosporine dose reduction. Simultaneous coadministration of cyclosporine significantly increases blood levels of sirolimus. To minimize increases in sirolimus blood concentrations, it is recommended that sirolimus be given 4 hours after cyclosporine administration.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Cyclosporine gave no evidence of mutagenic or teratogenic effects in appropriate test systems. Only at dose levels toxic to dams, were adverse effects seen in reproduction studies in rats (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#_A32F83B1-1749-20A8-9F64-E7A82A5F9807">Pregnancy</a></span>).</p>
<p>Carcinogenicity studies were carried out in male and female rats and mice. In the 78-week mouse study, at doses of 1, 4, and 16 mg/kg/day, evidence of a statistically significant trend was found for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4119130" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma - small lymphocytic">lymphocytic lymphomas</span> in females, and the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in mid-dose males significantly exceeded the control value. In the 24-month rat study, conducted at 0.5, 2, and 8 mg/kg/day, pancreatic islet cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> significantly exceeded the control rate in the low-dose level. The hepatocellular carcinomas and pancreatic islet cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> were not dose related.</p>
<p>No impairment in fertility was demonstrated in studies in male and female rats.</p>
<p>Cyclosporine has not been found mutagenic/genotoxic in the Ames Test, the V79-HGPRT Test, the micronucleus test in mice and Chinese hamsters, the chromosome-aberration tests in Chinese hamster bone marrow, the mouse dominant lethal assay, and the DNA-repair test in sperm from treated mice. A recent study analyzing sister chromatid exchange (SCE) induction by cyclosporine using human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span> <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> gave indication of a positive effect (i.e., induction of SCE), at high concentrations in this system. In two published research studies, rabbits exposed to cyclosporine <span class="Italics">in utero</span> (10 mg/kg/day subcutaneously) demonstrated reduced numbers of nephrons, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192686" conceptname="Hypertrophy of kidney">renal hypertrophy</span>, systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> and progressive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> up to 35 weeks of age. Pregnant rats which received 12 mg/kg/day of cyclosporine intravenously (twice the recommended human intravenous dose) had fetuses with an increased incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434462" conceptname="Ventricular septal defect">ventricular septal defect</span>. These findings have not been demonstrated in other species and their relevance for humans is unknown.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Pregnancy Category C. </span></span></h3>
<p class="First">Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity in rats and rabbits. Cyclosporine gave no evidence of mutagenic or teratogenic effects in the standard test systems with oral application (rats up to 17 mg/kg and rabbits up to 30 mg/kg per day orally). Cyclosporine oral solution, USP has been shown to be embryo- and fetotoxic in rats and rabbits when given in doses 2 to 5 times the human dose. At toxic doses (rats at 30 mg/kg/day and rabbits at 100 mg/kg/day), cyclosporine oral solution, USP was embryo- and fetotoxic as indicated by increased pre- and postnatal mortality and reduced fetal weight together with related skeletal retardations. In the well-tolerated dose range (rats at up to 17 mg/kg/day and rabbits at up to 30 mg/kg/day), cyclosporine oral solution, USP proved to be without any embryolethal or teratogenic effects.</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women and therefore, cyclosporine capsules should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<p>In pregnant transplant recipients who are being treated with immunosuppressants, the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439128" conceptname="Extreme immaturity">premature birth</span> is increased. The following data represent the reported outcomes of 116 pregnancies in women receiving cyclosporine capsules during pregnancy, 90% of whom were transplant patients, and most of whom received cyclosporine capsules throughout the entire gestational period. Since most of the patients were not prospectively identified, the results are likely to be biased toward negative outcomes. The only consistent patterns of abnormality were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439128" conceptname="Extreme immaturity">premature birth</span> (gestational period of 28 to 36 weeks) and low birth weight for gestational age. It is not possible to separate the effects of cyclosporine capsules on these pregnancies from the effects of the other immunosuppressants, the underlying maternal disorders, or other aspects of the transplantation milieu. Sixteen fetal losses occurred. Most of the pregnancies (85 of 100) were complicated by disorders; including, preeclampsia, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443700" conceptname="Eclampsia">eclampsia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4273560" conceptname="Premature labor">premature labor</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198488" conceptname="Placental abruption">abruptio placentae</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span>, Rh incompatibility and fetoplacental dysfunction. Preterm delivery occurred in 47%. Seven malformations were reported in 5 viable infants and in 2 cases of fetal loss. Twenty-eight percent of the infants were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="72726" conceptname="Light-for-dates with signs of fetal malnutrition">small for gestational age</span>. Neonatal complications occurred in 27%. In a report of 23 children followed up to 4 years, postnatal development was said to be normal. More information on cyclosporine use in pregnancy, please write to: Apotex Corp., Consumer Affairs, 2400 N. Commerce Parkway, Suite 400, Weston, FL 33326.</p>
<p>A limited number of observations in children exposed to cyclosporine <span class="Italics">in utero</span> are available, up to an age of approximately 7 years. Renal function and blood pressure in these children were normal.</p>
<p>The alcohol content of the cyclosporine formulations should also be taken into account in pregnant women (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID_df963911-b6c3-4207-8f5a-06ee32b5cbfc">WARNINGS, Special Excipients</a></span>).</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Cyclosporine is present in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse drug reactions in nursing infants from cyclosporine capsules, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Cyclosporine capsules contains methanol. Methanol will be present in human milk at levels similar to that found in maternal serum and if present in breast milk will be orally absorbed by a nursing infant (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#_CAE1E13A-FA89-B1AC-BC5C-99E4CCF72E5F">WARNINGS</a></span>).</p>

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Although no adequate and well-controlled studies have been conducted in children, patients as young as 6 months of age have received the drug with no unusual adverse effects.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of cyclosporine capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">There is a minimal experience with overdosage. Because of the slow absorption of cyclosporine capsules, forced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> and gastric lavage would be of value up to 2 hours after administration. Transient hepatotoxicity and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126119" conceptname="Toxic nephropathy">nephrotoxicity</span> may occur which should resolve following drug withdrawal. Oral doses of cyclosporine up to 10 g (about 150 mg/kg) have been tolerated with relatively minor clinical consequences, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span> and, in a few patients, moderately severe, reversible impairment of renal function. However, serious symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> have been reported following accidental parenteral overdosage with cyclosporine in premature neonates. General supportive measures and symptomatic treatment should be followed in all cases of overdosage. Cyclosporine capsules is not dialyzable to any great extent, nor is it cleared well by charcoal hemoperfusion. The oral LD<span class="Sub">50</span> is 2329 mg/kg in mice, 1480 mg/kg in rats, and &gt; 1000 mg/kg in rabbits. The I.V.

<h2>Cyclosporine capsules, (NON-MODIFIED) </h2>
<p class="First">Cyclosporine capsules, (NON-MODIFIED) have decreased bioavailability in comparison to Neoral<span class="Sup">®</span>* (cyclosporine capsules, USP) MODIFIED. Cyclosporine capsules, (NON-MODIFIED) and Neoral<span class="Sup">®</span>* (cyclosporine capsules, USP) MODIFIED are not bioequivalent and cannot be used interchangeably without physician supervision.</p>
<p>The initial oral dose of cyclosporine capsules, (NON-MODIFIED) should be given 4 to 12 hours prior to transplantation as a single dose of 15 mg/kg. Although a daily single dose of 14 to 18 mg/kg was used in most clinical trials, few centers continue to use the highest dose, most favoring the lower end of the scale. There is a trend towards use of even lower initial doses for renal transplantation in the ranges of 10 to 14 mg/kg/day. The initial single daily dose is continued postoperatively for 1 to 2 weeks and then tapered by 5% per week to a maintenance dose of 5 to 10 mg/kg/day. Some centers have successfully tapered the maintenance dose to as low as 3 mg/kg/day in selected <span class="Italics">renal</span> transplant patients without an apparent rise in rejection rate.</p>

<p>Cyclosporine undergoes minimal renal elimination and its pharmacokinetics do not appear to be significantly altered in patients with end-stage <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span> who receive routine hemodialysis treatments (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#_D1FAC667-DCAA-FCD8-8396-2602ABF673C8">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span>). However, due to its nephrotoxic potential (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#_CAE1E13A-FA89-B1AC-BC5C-99E4CCF72E5F">WARNINGS</a></span>), careful monitoring of renal function is recommended; cyclosporine dosage should be reduced if indicated (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#_CAE1E13A-FA89-B1AC-BC5C-99E4CCF72E5F">WARNINGS </a>and <a href="#_BCD9C1C8-455C-3C51-333B-5A49EB108553">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>).</p>

<p>The clearance of cyclosporine may be significantly reduced in severe liver disease patients (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#_D1FAC667-DCAA-FCD8-8396-2602ABF673C8">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span>). Dose reduction may be necessary in patients with severe liver impairment to maintain blood concentrations within the recommended target range (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#_CAE1E13A-FA89-B1AC-BC5C-99E4CCF72E5F">WARNINGS </a>and <a href="#_BCD9C1C8-455C-3C51-333B-5A49EB108553">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>). </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Pediatrics</span></span></p>
<p>In pediatric usage, the same dose and dosing regimen may be used as in adults although in several studies, children have required and tolerated higher doses than those used in adults.</p>
<p>Adjunct therapy with adrenal corticosteroids is recommended. Different tapering dosage schedules of prednisone appear to achieve similar results. A dosage schedule based on the patient’s weight started with 2.0 mg/kg/day for the first 4 days tapered to 1.0 mg/kg/day by 1 week, 0.6 mg/kg/day by 2 weeks, 0.3 mg/kg/day by 1 month, and 0.15 mg/kg/day by 2 months and thereafter as a maintenance dose. Another center started with an initial dose of 200 mg tapered by 40 mg/day until reaching 20 mg/day. After 2 months at this dose, a further reduction to 10 mg/day was made. Adjustments in dosage of prednisone must be made according to the clinical situation. </p>

<h2>Blood Concentration Monitoring</h2>
<p class="First">Several study centers have found blood concentration monitoring of cyclosporine useful in patient management. While no fixed relationships have yet been established, in one series of 375 consecutive cadaveric renal transplant recipients, dosage was adjusted to achieve specific whole blood 24-hour trough concentrations of 100 to 200 ng/mL as determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).</p>
<p>Of major importance to blood concentration analysis is the type of assay used. The above concentrations are specific to the parent cyclosporine molecule and correlate directly to the new monoclonal specific radioimmunoassays (mRIA-sp). Nonspecific assays are also available which detect the parent compound molecule and various of its metabolites. Older studies often cited concentrations using a nonspecific assay which were roughly twice those of specific assays. Assay results are not interchangeable and their use should be guided by their approved labeling. If plasma specimens are employed, concentrations will vary with the temperature at the time of separation from whole blood. Plasma concentrations may range from 1/2 to 1/5 of whole blood concentrations. Refer to individual assay labeling for complete instructions. In addition, <span class="Italics">Transplantation Proceedings</span> (June 1990) contains position papers and a broad consensus generated at the Cyclosporine-Therapeutic Drug Monitoring conference that year. Blood concentration monitoring is not a replacement for renal function monitoring or tissue biopsies.</p>
