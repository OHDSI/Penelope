<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY </h1>
<p class="First">Metoclopramide stimulates motility of the upper gastrointestinal tract without stimulating gastric, biliary or pancreatic secretions. Its mode of action is unclear. It seems to sensitize tissues to the action of acetylcholine. The effect of metoclopramide on motility is not dependent on intact vagal innervation, but it can be abolished by anticholinergic drugs.</p>
<p>Metoclopramide increases the tone and amplitude of gastric (especially antral) contractions, relaxes the pyloric sphincter and the duodenal bulb, and increases peristalsis of the duodenum and jejunum resulting in accelerated gastric emptying and intestinal transit. It increases the resting tone of the lower esophageal sphincter. It has little, if any, effect on the motility of the colon or gallbladder.</p>
<p>In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318800" conceptname="Gastroesophageal reflux disease">gastroesophageal reflux</span> and low LESP (lower esophageal sphincter pressure), single oral doses of metoclopramide produce dose-related increases in LESP. Effects begin at about 5 mg and increase through 20 mg (the largest dose tested). The increase in LESP from a 5 mg dose lasts about 45 minutes and that of 20 mg lasts between 2 and 3 hours. Increased rate of stomach emptying has been observed with single oral doses of 10 mg.</p>
<p>The antiemetic properties of metoclopramide appear to be a result of its antagonism of central and peripheral dopamine receptors. Dopamine produces <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> by stimulation of the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), and metoclopramide blocks stimulation of the CTZ by agents like l-dopa or apomorphine, which are known to increase dopamine levels or to possess dopamine-like effects. Metoclopramide also abolishes the slowing of gastric emptying caused by apomorphine.</p>
<p>Like the phenothiazines and related drugs, which are also dopamine antagonists, metoclopramide produces sedation and may produce extrapyramidal reactions, although these are comparatively rare (see <a href="#ba81506f-8b31-4c67-ac16-5b5f912a457f">WARNINGS</a>). Metoclopramide inhibits the central and peripheral effects of apomorphine, induces release of prolactin and causes a transient increase in circulating aldosterone levels, which may be associated with transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4125002" conceptname="Idiopathic fluid retention">fluid retention</span>.</p>
<p>The onset of pharmacological action of metoclopramide is 1 to 3 minutes following an intravenous dose, 10 to 15 minutes following intramuscular administration, and 30 to 60 minutes following an oral dose; pharmacological effects persist for 1 to 2 hours.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics </h2>
<p class="First">Metoclopramide is rapidly and well absorbed. Relative to an intravenous dose of 20 mg, the absolute oral bioavailability of metoclopramide is 80% ±15.5% as demonstrated in a crossover study of 18 subjects. Peak plasma concentrations occur at about 1 to 2 hours after a single oral dose. Similar time to peak is observed after individual doses at steady state.</p>
<p>In a single dose study of 12 subjects, the area under the drug concentration-time curve increases linearly with doses from 20 to 100 mg. Peak concentrations increase linearly with dose; time to peak concentrations remains the same; whole body clearance is unchanged; and the elimination rate remains the same. The average elimination half-life in individuals with normal renal function is 5 to 6 hours. Linear kinetic processes adequately describe the absorption and elimination of metoclopramide.</p>
<p>Approximately 85% of the radioactivity of an orally administered dose appears in the urine within 72 hours. Of the 85% eliminated in the urine, about half is present as free or conjugated metoclopramide.</p>
<p>The drug is not extensively bound to plasma proteins (about 30%). The whole body volume of distribution is high (about 3.5 L/kg) which suggests extensive distribution of drug to the tissues.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal impairment</span> affects the clearance of metoclopramide. In a study with patients with varying degrees of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, a reduction in creatinine clearance was correlated with a reduction in plasma clearance, renal clearance, non-renal clearance, and increase in elimination half-life. The kinetics of metoclopramide in the presence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> remained linear however. The reduction in clearance as a result of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> suggests that adjustment downward of maintenance dosage should be done to avoid drug accumulation.</p>

<p>In pediatric patients, the pharmacodynamics of metoclopramide following oral and intravenous administration are highly variable and a concentration-effect relationship has not been established.</p>
<p>There are insufficient reliable data to conclude whether the pharmacokinetics of metoclopramide in adults and the pediatric population are similar. Although there are insufficient data to support the efficacy of metoclopramide in pediatric patients with symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318800" conceptname="Gastroesophageal reflux disease">gastroesophageal reflux</span> (GER) or cancer chemotherapy-related <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, its pharmacokinetics have been studied in these patient populations.</p>
<p>In an open-label study, six pediatric patients (age range, 3.5 weeks to 5.4 months) with GER received metoclopramide 0.15 mg/kg oral solution every 6 hours for 10 doses. The mean peak plasma concentration of metoclopramide after the tenth dose was 2-fold (56.8 mcg/L) higher compared to that observed after the first dose (29 mcg/L) indicating drug accumulation with repeated dosing. After the tenth dose, the mean time to reach peak concentrations (2.2 hr), half-life (4.1 hr), clearance (0.67 L/h/kg), and volume of distribution (4.4 L/kg) of metoclopramide were similar to those observed after the first dose. In the youngest patient (age, 3.5 weeks), metoclopramide half-life after the first and the tenth dose (23.1 and 10.3 hr, respectively) was significantly longer compared to other infants due to reduced clearance. This may be attributed to immature hepatic and renal systems at birth.</p>
<p>Single intravenous doses of metoclopramide 0.22 to 0.46 mg/kg (mean, 0.35 mg/kg) were administered over 5 minutes to 9 pediatric cancer patients receiving chemotherapy (mean age, 11.7 years; range, 7 to 14 yr) for prophylaxis of cytotoxic-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>. The metoclopramide plasma concentrations extrapolated to time zero ranged from 65 to 395 mcg/L (mean, 152 mcg/L). The mean elimination half-life, clearance, and volume of distribution of metoclopramide were 4.4 hr (range, 1.7 to 8.3 hr), 0.56 L/h/kg (range, 0.12 to 1.20 L/h/kg), and 3.0 L/kg (range, 1.0 to 4.8 L/kg), respectively.</p>
<p>In another study, nine pediatric cancer patients (age range, 1 to 9 yr) received 4 to 5 intravenous infusions (over 30 minutes) of metoclopramide at a dose of 2 mg/kg to control <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span>. After the last dose, the peak serum concentrations of metoclopramide ranged from 1060 to 5680 mcg/L. The mean elimination half-life, clearance, and volume of distribution of metoclopramide were 4.5 hr (range, 2.0 to 12.5 hr), 0.37 L/h/kg (range, 0.10 to 1.24 L/h/kg), and 1.93 L/kg (range, 0.95 to 5.50 L/kg), respectively.</p>

<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373747" conceptname="Extrapyramidal disease">Extrapyramidal symptoms</span>, manifested primarily as acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375800" conceptname="Dystonia">dystonic reactions</span>, occur in approximately 1 in 500 patients treated with the usual adult dosages of 30 to 40 mg/day of metoclopramide. These usually are seen during the first 24 to 48 hours of treatment with metoclopramide, occur more frequently in pediatric patients and adult patients less than 30 years of age and are even more frequent at the higher doses. These symptoms may include involuntary movements of limbs and facial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221082" conceptname="Grimaces">grimacing</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440814" conceptname="Torticollis">torticollis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205592" conceptname="Oculogyric crisis">oculogyric crisis</span>, rhythmic protrusion of tongue, bulbar type of speech, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4339090" conceptname="Trismus">trismus</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375800" conceptname="Dystonia">dystonic reactions</span> resembling <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435740" conceptname="Tetanus">tetanus</span>.

If these symptoms should occur, inject 50 mg diphenhydramine hydrochloride intramuscularly, and they usually will subside. Benztropine mesylate, 1 to 2 mg intramuscularly, may also be used to reverse these reactions.</p>
<p>Parkinsonian-like symptoms have occurred, more commonly within the first 6 months after beginning treatment with metoclopramide, but occasionally after longer periods. These symptoms generally subside within 2 to 3 months following discontinuance of metoclopramide. Patients with preexisting Parkinson’s disease should be given metoclopramide cautiously, if at all, since such patients may experience exacerbation of parkinsonian symptoms when taking metoclopramide.</p>

<p>Treatment with metoclopramide can cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> (TD), a potentially irreversible and disfiguring disorder characterized by involuntary movements of the face, tongue, or extremities. The risk of developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> increases with duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose. An analysis of utilization patterns showed that about 20% of patients who used metoclopramide took it for longer than 12 weeks. Treatment with metoclopramide for longer than the recommended 12 weeks should be avoided in all but rare cases where therapeutic benefit is thought to outweigh the risk of developing TD.</p>
<p>Although the risk of developing TD in the general population may be increased among the elderly, women, and diabetics, it is not possible to predict which patients will develop metoclopramide-induced TD. Both the risk of developing TD and the likelihood that TD will become irreversible increase with duration of treatment and total cumulative dose.</p>
<p>Metoclopramide should be discontinued in patients who develop signs or symptoms of TD. There is no known effective treatment for established cases of TD, although in some patients, TD may remit, partially or completely, within several weeks to months after metoclopramide is withdrawn.</p>
<p>Metoclopramide itself may suppress, or partially suppress, the signs of TD, thereby masking the underlying disease process. The effect of this symptomatic suppression upon the long term course of TD is unknown. Therefore, metoclopramide should not be used for the symptomatic control of TD.</p>

<p>The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated.

<p>The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of metoclopramide and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available.</p>
<p>Bromocriptine and dantrolene sodium have been used in treatment of NMS, but their effectiveness have not been established (see <a href="#bca15414-3fb0-4bf2-ae3c-6701f7bac642">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a>).</p>

<p>Because metoclopramide produces a transient increase in plasma aldosterone, certain patients, especially those with cirrhosis or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>, may be at risk of developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4125002" conceptname="Idiopathic fluid retention">fluid retention</span> and volume overload. If these side effects occur at anytime during metoclopramide therapy, the drug should be discontinued.</p>
<p>Adverse reactions, especially those involving the nervous system, may occur after stopping the use of metoclopramide. A small number of patients may experience a withdrawal period after stopping metoclopramide that could cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436817" conceptname="Feeling nervous">nervousness</span>, and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headaches</span>.</p>

Although the overall incidence of FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Information for Patients</span></span></p>
<p>The use of metoclopramide oral solution is recommended for adults only. Metoclopramide may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. The ambulatory patient should be cautioned accordingly.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Drug Interactions</span></span></p>
<p>The effects of metoclopramide on gastrointestinal motility are antagonized by anticholinergic drugs and narcotic analgesics. Additive sedative effects can occur when metoclopramide is given with alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, narcotics, or tranquilizers.</p>
<p>The finding that metoclopramide releases catecholamines in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320128" conceptname="Essential hypertension">essential hypertension</span> suggests that it should be used cautiously, if at all, in patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors.</p>
<p>Absorption of drugs from the stomach may be diminished (e.g. digoxin) by metoclopramide, whereas the rate and/or extent of absorption of drugs from the small bowel may be increased (e.g., acetaminophen, tetracycline, levodopa, ethanol, cyclosporine).</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="195847" conceptname="Gastroparesis syndrome">Gastroparesis</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="195847" conceptname="Gastroparesis syndrome">gastric stasis</span>) may be responsible for poor diabetic control in some patients. Exogenously administered insulin may begin to act before food has left the stomach and lead to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. Because the action of metoclopramide will influence the delivery of food to the intestines and thus the rate of absorption, insulin dosage or timing of dosage may require adjustment.</p>

<p>A 77-week study was conducted in rats with oral doses up to about 40 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Metoclopramide elevates prolactin levels and the elevation persists during chronic administration. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of metoclopramide is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. Although disturbances such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79884" conceptname="Galactorrhea not associated with childbirth">galactorrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443800" conceptname="Amenorrhea">amenorrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168447" conceptname="Gynecomastia">gynecomastia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">impotence</span> have been reported with prolactin-elevating drugs, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. An increase in mammary neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of prolactin-stimulating neuroleptic drugs and metoclopramide. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date, however, have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis; the available evidence is too limited to be conclusive at this time.</p>
<p>An Ames mutagenicity test performed on metoclopramide was negative.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Pregnancy Category B</span></span></p>
<p>Reproduction studies performed in rats, mice and rabbits by the I.V., I.M., S.C., and oral routes at maximum levels ranging from 12 to 250 times the human dose have demonstrated no impairment of fertility or significant harm to the fetus due to metoclopramide. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Nursing Mothers</span></span></p>
<p>Metoclopramide is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when metoclopramide is administered to a nursing mother.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Pediatric Use</span></span></p>
<p>Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established (see <a href="#ba336c92-612c-4151-982e-b2ee51ff3b9d">OVERDOSAGE</a>).</p>
<p>Care should be exercised in administering metoclopramide to neonates since prolonged clearance may produce excessive serum concentrations (see <a href="#b006222c-dc67-4c85-a7df-6840fdc01b76">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY-Pharmacokinetics</a>). In addition, neonates have reduced levels of NADH-cytochrome b<span class="Sub">5</span> reductase which, in combination with the aforementioned pharmacokinetic factors, make neonates more susceptible to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">methemoglobinemia</span> (see <a href="#ba336c92-612c-4151-982e-b2ee51ff3b9d">OVERDOSAGE</a>).</p>
<p>The safety profile of metoclopramide in adults cannot be extrapolated to pediatric patients. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375800" conceptname="Dystonia">Dystonias</span> and other extrapyramidal reactions associated with metoclopramide are more common in the pediatric population than in adults. (See <a href="#ba336c92-612c-4151-982e-b2ee51ff3b9d">WARNINGS</a> and <a href="#bca15414-3fb0-4bf2-ae3c-6701f7bac642">ADVERSE REACTIONS-Extrapyramidal Reactions</a>.)</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Geriatric Use</span></span></p>
<p>Clinical studies of metoclopramide did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects.</p>
<p>The risk of developing parkinsonian-like side effects increases with ascending dose. Geriatric patients should receive the lowest dose of metoclopramide that is effective. If parkinsonian-like symptoms develop in a geriatric patient receiving metoclopramide, metoclopramide should generally be discontinued before initiating any specific anti-parkinsonian agents (see <a href="#ba81506f-8b31-4c67-ac16-5b5f912a457f">WARNINGS</a> and <a href="#b65ec097-0536-46a1-a81c-2cb3a78cbc8c">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION-For the Relief of Symptomatic Gastroesphogeal Reflux</a>).</p>

<p>Metoclopramide is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> (see <a href="#b65ec097-0536-46a1-a81c-2cb3a78cbc8c">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION-Use in Patients with Renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic Impairment</span></a>).</p>
<p>For these reasons, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased renal functions, concomitant disease, or other drug therapy in the elderly (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>-<a href="#reliefgastroreflux">For the Relief of Symptomatic Gastroesphogeal Reflux</a> and <a href="#patientswithimpairment">Use in Patients with Renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic Impairment</span></a>).</p>

<p>Hemodialysis removes relatively little metoclopramide, probably because of the small amount of the drug in blood relative to tissues.

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Therapy with metoclopramide oral solution should not exceed 12 weeks in duration.</span></p>

<p>Administer from 10 mg to 15 mg metoclopramide orally up to 4 times daily 30 minutes before each meal and at bedtime, depending upon symptoms being treated and clinical response (see <a href="#bfaaad98-3b64-42c6-849f-5fcd51ec3706">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a> and <a href="#bea31f94-36c4-4aaf-90c5-16b6f96ac143">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</a>). If symptoms occur only intermittently or at specific times of the day, use of metoclopramide in single doses up to 20 mg prior to the provoking situation may be preferred rather than continuous treatment. Occasionally, patients (such as elderly patients) who are more sensitive to the therapeutic or adverse effects of metoclopramide will require only 5 mg per dose.</p>
<p>Experience with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4024833" conceptname="Esophageal erosions">esophageal erosions</span> and ulcerations is limited, but healing has thus far been documented in one controlled trial using 4 times daily therapy at 15 mg/dose, and this regimen should be used when lesions are present, so long as it is tolerated (see <a href="#bca15414-3fb0-4bf2-ae3c-6701f7bac642">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a>). Because of the poor correlation between symptoms and endoscopic appearance of the esophagus, therapy directed at esophageal lesions is best guided by endoscopic evaluation.</p>
<p>Therapy longer than 12 weeks has not been evaluated and cannot be recommended.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">For the Relief of Symptoms Associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142033" conceptname="Diabetic gastroparesis">Diabetic Gastroparesis</span> (Diabetic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="195847" conceptname="Gastroparesis syndrome">Gastric Stasis</span>)</span></span></p>
<p>Administer 10 mg of metoclopramide 30 minutes before each meal and at bedtime for two to eight weeks, depending upon response and the likelihood of continued well-being upon drug discontinuation.</p>
<p>The initial route of administration should be determined by the severity of the presenting symptoms. If only the earliest manifestations of diabetic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="195847" conceptname="Gastroparesis syndrome">gastric stasis</span> are present, oral administration of metoclopramide may be initiated. However, if severe symptoms are present, therapy should begin with metoclopramide injection (consult labeling of the injection prior to initiating parenteral administration).</p>
<p>Administration of metoclopramide injection up to 10 days maybe required before symptoms subside at which time oral administration may be instituted. Since diabetic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="195847" conceptname="Gastroparesis syndrome">gastric stasis</span> is frequently recurrent, metoclopramide therapy should be reinstituted at the earliest manifestation.</p>

<p>Since metoclopramide is excreted principally through the kidneys, in those patients whose creatinine clearance is below 40 mL/min, therapy should be initiated at approximately one-half the recommended dosage. Depending upon clinical efficacy and safety considerations, the dosage may be increased or decreased as appropriate.</p>

<p>Metoclopramide undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism, except for simple conjugation. Its safe use has been described in patients with advanced liver disease whose renal function was normal.</p>
