Renal and eighth cranial nerve function should be closely monitored, especially in patients with known or suspected reduced renal function at onset of therapy and also in those whose renal function is initially normal but who develop signs of renal dysfunction during therapy. Urine should be examined for decreased specific gravity, increased excretion of protein, and the presence of cells or casts. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, or creatinine clearance should be determined periodically. When feasible, it is recommended that serial audiograms be obtained in patients old enough to be tested, particularly highrisk patients.

As with the other aminoglycosides, on rare occasions changes in renal and eighth cranial nerve function may not become manifest until soon after completion of therapy. Serum concentrations of aminoglycosides should be monitored when feasible to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels. When monitoring gentamicin peak concentrations, dosage should be adjusted so that prolonged levels above 12 mcg/mL are avoided. When monitoring gentamicin trough concentrations, dosage should be adjusted so that levels above 2 mcg/mL are avoided. Excessive peak and/or trough serum concentrations of aminoglycosides may increase the risk of renal and eighth cranial nerve toxicity. In the event of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> or toxic reactions, hemodialysis may aid in the removal of gentamicin from the blood, especially if renal function is, or becomes, compromised.

<p>Gentamicin Sulfate Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of gentamicin sulfate in water for injection. It is administered by the intramuscular or intravenous route. Each milliliter (mL) contains gentamicin sulfate equivalent to 40 mg gentamicin base with sodium metabisulfite 2.9 mg and edetate disodium anhydrous 0.1 mg added as stabilizer, methylparaben 1.8 mg and propylparaben 0.2 mg added as preservatives. Headspace nitrogen gassed. May contain sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. The pH is 3.8 (3.0 to 5.5). Gentamicin is classified as an aminoglycoside antibiotic and is derived from Micromonospora purpurea, an actinomycete. The chemical name for gentamicin C1A is: 0-3-Deoxy-4-C-methyl-3-(methylamino)-b-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1#6)-0-[2,6- diamino-2,3,4,6-tetradeoxy-a-D-erythro-hexopyranosyl-(1#4)]-2-deoxy-D-streptamine. Gentamicin Sulfate, USP is chemically designated gentamicin sulfate, a white to buff powder soluble in water. It has the following structural formula:</p>

<h1>Clinical Pharmacology</h1>
<p class="First">After intramuscular administration of gentamicin sulfate, peak serum concentrations usually occur between 30 to 60 minutes and serum levels are measurable for 6 to 8 hours. When gentamicin is administered by intravenous infusion over a two-hour period, the serum concentrations are similar to those obtained by intramuscular administration. In patients with normal renal function, peak serum concentrations of gentamicin (mcg/mL) are usually up to four times the single intramuscular dose (mg/kg); for example, a 1 mg/kg injection in adults may be expected to result in a peak serum concentration up to 4 mcg/mL; a 1.5 mg/kg dose may produce levels up to 6 mcg/mL. While some variation is to be expected due to a number of variables such as age, body temperature, surface area and physiologic differences, the individual patient given the same dose tends to have similar levels in repeated determinations. Gentamicin administered at 1 mg/kg every eight hours for the usual 7- to 10-day treatment period to patients with normal renal function does not accumulate in the serum. Gentamicin, like all aminoglycosides, may accumulate in the serum and tissues of patients treated with higher doses and for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4088438" conceptname="Prolonged periods">prolonged periods</span>, particularly in the presence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>. In adult patients, treatment with gentamicin dosages of 4 mg/kg/day or higher for seven to ten days may result in a slight, progressive rise in both peak and trough concentrations. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>, gentamicin is cleared from the body more slowly than in patients with normal renal function. The more severe the impairment, the slower the clearance.<br><span class="Bold">Dosage must be adjusted.</span><br>Since gentamicin is distributed in extracellular fluid, peak serum concentrations may be lower than usual in adult patients who have a large volume of this fluid. Serum concentrations of gentamicin in febrile patients may be lower than those in afebrile patients given the same dose. When body temperature returns to normal, serum concentrations of the drug may rise. Febrile and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemic</span> states may be associated with a shorter than usual serum half-life. (Dosage adjustment is usually not necessary.) In severely burned patients, the half-life may be significantly decreased and resulting serum concentrations may be lower than anticipated from the mg/kg dose. Protein binding studies have indicated that the degree of gentamicin binding is low, depending upon the methods used for testing, this may be between 0 and 30%. After initial administration to patients with normal renal function, generally 70% or more of the gentamicin dose is recoverable in the urine in 24 hours; concentrations in urine above 100 mcg/mL may be achieved. Little, if any metabolic transformation occurs; the drug is excreted principally by glomerular filtration. After several days of treatment, the amount of gentamicin excreted in the urine approaches the daily dose administered. As with other aminoglycosides, a small amount of the gentamicin dose may be retained in the tissues, especially in the kidneys. Minute quantities of aminoglycosides have been detected in the urine weeks after drug administration was discontinued. Renal clearance of gentamicin is similar to that of endogenous creatinine. In patients with marked impairment of renal function, there is a decrease in the concentration of aminoglycosides in urine and in their penetration into defective renal parenchyma. This decreased drug excretion, together with the potential <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126119" conceptname="Toxic nephropathy">nephrotoxicity</span> of aminoglycosides, should be considered when treating such patients who have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="81902" conceptname="Urinary tract infectious disease">urinary tract infections</span>. Probenecid does not affect renal tubular transport of gentamicin. The endogenous creatinine clearance rate and the serum creatinine level have a high correlation with the half-life of gentamicin in serum. Results of these tests may serve as guides for adjusting dosage in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Following parenteral administration, gentamicin can be detected in serum, lymph, tissues, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4102774" conceptname="Productive cough">sputum</span>, and in pleural, synovial, and peritoneal fluids. Concentrations in renal cortex sometimes may be eight times higher than the usual serum levels. Concentrations in bile, in general, have been low and have suggested minimal biliary excretion. Gentamicin crosses the peritoneal as well as the placental membranes. Since aminoglycosides diffuse poorly into the subarachnoid space after parenteral administration, concentrations of gentamicin in cerebrospinal fluid are often low and dependent upon dose, rate of penetration and degree of meningeal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span>. There is minimal penetration of gentamicin into ocular tissues following intramuscular or intravenous administration. <span class="Italics"><br>Microbiology</span><br>In vitro tests have demonstrated that gentamicin is a bactericidal antibiotic which acts by inhibiting normal protein synthesis in susceptible microorganisms. It is active against a wide variety of pathogenic bacteria including Escherichia coli, Proteus species (indole-positive and indole-negative); Pseudomonas aeruginosa, species of Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia group; Citrobacter species, and Staphylococcusspecies (including penicillin- and methicillin-resistant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span>). Gentamicin is also active in vitro against species of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span> and Shigella. The following bacteria are usually resistant to aminoglycosides: Streptococcus pneumoniae, most species of streptococci, particularly group D and anaerobic organisms, such as Bacteroides species or Clostridium species. In vitro studies have shown that an aminoglycoside combined with an antibiotic that interferes with cell wall synthesis may act synergistically against some group D streptococcal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span>. The combination of gentamicin and penicillin G has a synergistic bactericidal effect against virtually all <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of Streptococcus faecalis and its varieties (S. faecalis var. liquifaciens, S. faecalis var. zymogenes), S. faecium and S. durans. An enhanced killing effect against many of these <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> has also been shown in vitro with combinations of gentamicin and ampicillin, carbenicillin, nafcillin or oxacillin. The combined effect of gentamicin and carbenicillin is synergistic for many <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In vitro synergism<br>against other gram-negative organisms has been shown with combinations of gentamicin and cephalosporins. Gentamicin may be active against clinical isolates of bacteria resistant to other aminoglycosides. Bacteria resistant to one aminoglycoside may be resistant to one or more other aminoglycosides. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4207042" conceptname="Viral resistance">Bacterial resistance</span> to gentamicin is generally developed slowly.<br><span class="Italics">Susceptibility Testing</span><br>If the disc method of susceptibility testing used is that described by Bauer et al (Am J Clin Path 45:493, 1966; Federal Register 37:20527 — 20529, 1972), a disc containing 10 mcg of gentamicin should give a zone of inhibition of 15 mm or more to indicate susceptibility of the infecting organism. Zones greater than 12 mm and less than 15 mm indicate intermediate susceptibility. A zone of 12 mm or less indicates that the infecting organism is likely to be resistant. In certain conditions it may be desirable to do additional susceptibility testing by the tube or agar dilution method; gentamicin is available for this purpose.</p>

<h1>Indications and Usage</h1>
<p class="First">To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of gentamicin and other antibacterial drugs, gentamicin should be used only to treat or prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Gentamicin Sulfate Injection, USP is indicated in the treatment of serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> caused by susceptible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of the following microorganisms: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus species (indole-positive and indole-negative), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella- Enterobacter-Serratia species, Citrobacter species, and Staphylococcus species (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative). Clinical studies have shown Gentamicin Sulfate Injection, USP to be effective in bacterial neonatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="132797" conceptname="Sepsis">sepsis</span>; bacterial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="132797" conceptname="Sepsis">septicemia</span>; and serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432545" conceptname="Bacterial infectious disease">bacterial infections</span> of the central nervous system (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435785" conceptname="Meningitis">meningitis</span>), urinary tract, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract (including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196152" conceptname="Peritonitis">peritonitis</span>), skin, bone and soft tissue (including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022094" conceptname="Thermal burn">burns</span>). Aminoglycosides, including gentamicin, are not indicated in uncomplicated initial episodes of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="81902" conceptname="Urinary tract infectious disease">urinary tract infections</span> unless the causative organisms are susceptible to these antibiotics and are not susceptible to antibiotics having less potential for toxicity. Specimens for bacterial culture should be obtained to isolate and identify causative organisms and to determine their susceptibility to gentamicin. Gentamicin sulfate may be considered as initial therapy in suspected or confirmed gram-negative <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span>, and therapy may be instituted before obtaining results of susceptibility testing. The decision to continue therapy with this drug should be based on the results of  susceptibility tests, the severity of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, and the important additional concepts contained in the WARNINGS box. If the causative organisms are resistant to gentamicin, other appropriate therapy should be instituted. In serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> when the causative organisms are unknown, gentamicin sulfate may be administered as initial therapy in conjunction with a penicillin-type or cephalosporin-type drug before obtaining results of susceptibility testing. If anaerobic organisms are suspected as etiologic agents, consideration should be given to using other suitable antimicrobial therapy in conjunction with gentamicin. Following identification of the organism and its susceptibility, appropriate antibiotic therapy should then be continued. Gentamicin sulfate has been used effectively in combination with carbenicillin for the treatment of life-threatening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It has also been found effective when used in conjunction with a penicillin-type drug for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441589" conceptname="Endocarditis">endocarditis</span> caused by group D streptococci. Gentamicin Sulfate Injection, USP has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435459" conceptname="Staphylococcal infectious disease">staphylococcal infections</span>. While not the antibiotic of first choice, gentamicin may be considered when penicillins or other less potentially toxic drugs are contraindicated and bacterial susceptibility tests and clinical judgment indicate its use. It may also be considered in mixed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> caused by susceptible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of staphylococci and gram-negative organisms.

<h1>Warnings</h1>
<p class="First">(See WARNINGS box.)<br>Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycoside antibiotics cross the placenta, and there have been several reports of total irreversible bilateral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4318712" conceptname="Congenital deafness">congenital deafness</span> in children whose mothers received streptomycin during pregnancy. Animal reproduction studies conducted on rats and rabbits did not reveal evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to gentamicin sulfate. It is also not known whether gentamicin sulfate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Serious side effects to mother, fetus, or newborn have not been reported in treatment of pregnant women with other aminoglycosides. If gentamicin is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking gentamicin, she should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatic</span> episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low.

<h1>Precautions</h1>
<p class="First">Neurotoxic and nephrotoxic antibiotics may be almost completely absorbed from body surfaces (except the urinary bladder) after local irrigation and after topical application during surgical procedures. The potential toxic effects of antibiotics administered in this fashion (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">neuromuscular blockade</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275136" conceptname="Paralysis of diaphragm">respiratory paralysis</span>, oto- and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126119" conceptname="Toxic nephropathy">nephrotoxicity</span>) should be considered (see WARNINGS box). Increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126119" conceptname="Toxic nephropathy">nephrotoxicity</span> has been reported following concomitant administration of aminoglycoside antibiotics and cephalosporins. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">Neuromuscular blockade</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275136" conceptname="Paralysis of diaphragm">respiratory paralysis</span> have been reported in the cat receiving high doses (40 mg/kg) of gentamicin. The possibility of these phenomena occurring in man should be considered if aminoglycosides are administered by any route to patients receiving anesthetics, or to patients receiving neuromuscular blocking agents, such as succinylcholine, tubocurarine, or decamethonium, or in patients receiving massive transfusions of citrate anticoagulated blood. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">neuromuscular blockade</span> occurs, calcium salts may reverse it. Aminoglycosides should be used with caution in patients with neuromuscular disorders, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="76685" conceptname="Myasthenia gravis">myasthenia gravis</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4140090" conceptname="Parkinsonism">parkinsonism</span>, since these drugs may aggravate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79908" conceptname="Muscle weakness">muscle weakness</span> because of their potential curare-like effects on the neuromuscular junction. During or following gentamicin therapy, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4193492" conceptname="Acroparesthesia">paresthesias</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380534" conceptname="Tetany">tetany</span>, positive Chvostek and Trousseau signs and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">mental confusion</span> have been described in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4098604" conceptname="Hypomagnesemia">hypomagnesemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435510" conceptname="Hypocalcemia">hypocalcemia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>.

Both adults and infants required appropriate corrective electrolyte therapy. Elderly patients may have reduced renal function which may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine. A creatinine clearance determination may be more useful. Monitoring of renal function during treatment with gentamicin, as with other aminoglycosides, is particularly important in such patients. A Fanconi-like syndrome, with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4262444" conceptname="Aminoaciduria">aminoaciduria</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span> has been reported in some adults and infants being given gentamicin injections. Cross-allergenicity among aminoglycosides has been demonstrated. Patients should be well hydrated during treatment. Although the in vitro mixing of gentamicin and carbenicillin results in a rapid and significant inactivation of gentamicin, this interaction has not been demonstrated in patients with normal renal function who received both drugs by different routes of administration. A reduction in gentamicin serum half-life has been reported in patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> receiving carbenicillin concomitantly with gentamicin. Treatment with gentamicin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. If this occurs, appropriate therapy is indicated.

<h1>Overdosage</h1>
<p class="First">In the event of overdosage or toxic reactions, hemodialysis may aid in the removal of gentamicin from the blood, and is especially important if renal function is, or becomes compromised. The rate of removal of gentamicin is considerably less by peritoneal dialysis than it is by hemodialysis.</p>

<h1>Dosage and Administration</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Gentamicin Sulfate Injection,</span> USP may be given intramuscularly or by intravenous infusion. The patient’s pretreatment body weight should be obtained for calculation of correct dosage. The dosage of aminoglycosides in obese patients should be based on an estimate of the lean body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span>. It is desirable to limit the duration of treatment with aminoglycosides to short term.<br><span class="Bold">Patients with Normal Renal Function<br>Adults:</span> The recommended dosage of gentamicin sulfate for patients with serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> and normal renal function is 3 mg/kg/day, administered in three equal doses every eight hours (Table 1). For patients with life-threatening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span>, dosages up to 5 mg/kg/day may be administered in three or four equal doses. The dosage should be reduced to 3 mg/kg/day as soon as clinically indicated (Table 1). It is desirable to measure both peak and trough serum concentrations of gentamicin to determine the adequacy and safety of the dosage. When such measurements are feasible, they should be carried out periodically during therapy to assure adequate but not excessive drug levels. For example, the peak concentration (at 30 to 60 minutes after intramuscular injection) is expected to be in the range of 4 to 6 mcg/mL. When monitoring peak concentrations after intramuscular or intravenous administration, dosage should be adjusted so that prolonged levels above 12 mcg/mL are avoided. When monitoring trough concentrations (just prior to the next dose), dosage should be adjusted so that levels above 2 mcg/mL are avoided. Determination of the adequacy of a serum level for a particular patient must take into consideration the susceptibility of the causative organism, the severity of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, and the status of the patient’s host-defense mechanisms. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022094" conceptname="Thermal burn">extensive burns</span>, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. In such patients treated with gentamicin, measurement of serum concentrations is recommended as a basis for dosage adjustment.</p>

For intermittent intravenous administration in adults, a single-dose of gentamicin sulfate may be diluted in 50 to 200 mL of sterile isotonic saline solution or in a sterile solution of 5% dextrose in water, in infants and children, the volume of diluent should be less. The solution may be infused over a period of one-half to two hours. The recommended dosage for intravenous and intramuscular administration is identical. Gentamicin sulfate should not be physically premixed with other drugs, but should be administered separately in accordance with the recommended route of administration and dosage schedule.<br><span class="Bold">Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Impaired Renal Function</span></span><br>Dosage must be adjusted in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> to assure therapeutically adequate, but not excessive blood levels. Whenever possible, serum concentrations of gentamicin should be monitored. One method of dosage adjustment is to increase the interval between administration of the usual doses. Since the serum creatinine concentration has a high correlation with the serum half-life of gentamicin, this laboratory test may provide guidance for adjustment of the interval between doses. The interval between doses (in hours) may be approximated by multiplying the serum creatinine level (mg/100 mL) by 8. For example, a patient weighing 60 kg with a serum creatinine level of 2.0 mg/100 mL could be given 60 mg (1 mg/kg) every 16 hours (2 x 8). In patients with serious systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, it may be desirable to administer the antibiotic more frequently but in reduced dosage. In such patients, serum concentrations of gentamicin should be measured so that adequate, but not excessive levels result. A peak and trough concentration measured intermittently during therapy will provide optimal guidance for adjusting dosage. After the usual initial dose, a rough guide for determining reduced dosage at eight-hour intervals is to divide the normally recommended dose by the serum creatinine level (Table 2). For example, after an initial dose of 60 mg (1 mg/kg), a patient weighing 60 kg with a serum creatinine level of 2.0 mg/100 mL could be given 30 mg every eight hours (60 ÷ 2). It should be noted that the status of renal function may be changing over the course of the infectious process. It is important to recognize that deteriorating renal function may require a greater reduction in dosage than that specified in the above guidelines for patients with stable <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>.<a name="ia862d4eb-5b07-4102-8195-a3985452cf37"></a><table width="676">

An eight-hour hemodialysis may reduce serum concentrations of gentamicin by approximately 50%. The recommended dose at the end of each dialysis period is 1 to 1.7 mg/kg depending upon the severity of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>. In children, a dose of 2 mg/kg may be administered. The above dosage schedules are not intended as rigid recommendations but are provided as guides to dosage when the measurement of gentamicin serum levels is not feasible. A variety of methods are available to measure gentamicin concentrations in body fluids; these include microbiologic, enzymatic and radioimmunoassay techniques.
