<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">In controlled clinical trials, carbamazepine has been shown to be effective in the treatment of psychomotor and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="374924" conceptname="Generalized convulsive epilepsy">grand mal seizures</span>, as well as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="379801" conceptname="Trigeminal neuralgia">trigeminal neuralgia</span>.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="43679-0">
<a name="section-4.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Carbamazepine has demonstrated anticonvulsant properties in rats and mice with electrically and chemically induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>. It appears to act by reducing polysynaptic responses and blocking the post-tetanic potentiation. Carbamazepine greatly reduces or abolishes <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> induced by stimulation of the infraorbital nerve in cats and rats. It depresses thalamic potential and bulbar and polysynaptic reflexes, including the linguomandibular reflex in cats. Carbamazepine is chemically unrelated to other anticonvulsants or other drugs used to control the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="379801" conceptname="Trigeminal neuralgia">trigeminal neuralgia</span>. The mechanism of action remains unknown.</p>
<p>The principal metabolite of carbamazepine, carbamazepine-10, 11-epoxide, has anticonvulsant activity as demonstrated in several in vivo animal models of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>. Though clinical activity for the epoxide has been postulated, the significance of its activity with respect to the safety and efficacy of carbamazepine has not been established.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">In clinical studies, carbamazepine suspension, conventional tablets, and extended-release tablets delivered equivalent amounts of drug to the systemic circulation. However, the suspension was absorbed somewhat faster, and the extended-release tablet slightly slower, than the conventional tablet. The bioavailability of the extended-release tablet was 89% compared to suspension. Following a b.i.d. dosage regimen, the suspension provides higher peak levels and lower trough levels than those obtained from the conventional tablet for the same dosage regimen. On the other hand, following a t.i.d. dosage regimen, carbamazepine suspension affords steady-state plasma levels comparable to carbamazepine tablets given b.i.d. when administered at the same total mg daily dose. Following a b.i.d. dosage regimen, carbamazepine extended-release tablets afford steady-state plasma levels comparable to conventional carbamazepine tablets given q.i.d., when administered at the same total mg daily dose. Carbamazepine in blood is 76% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma levels of carbamazepine are variable and may range from 0.5 - 25 µg/mL, with no apparent relationship to the daily intake of the drug. Usual adult therapeutic levels are between 4 and 12 µg/mL. In polytherapy, the concentration of carbamazepine and concomitant drugs may be increased or decreased during therapy, and drug effects may be altered (see<a href="#DI"> PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</a>). Following chronic oral administration of suspension, plasma levels peak at approximately 1.5 hours compared to 4 - 5 hours after administration of conventional carbamazepine tablets, and 3 - 12 hours after administration of carbamazepine-extended-release tablets. The CSF/serum ratio is 0.22, similar to the 24% unbound carbamazepine in serum. Because carbamazepine induces its own metabolism, the half-life is also variable. Autoinduction is completed after 3 - 5 weeks of a fixed dosing regimen. Initial half-life values range from 25 - 65 hours, decreasing to 12 - 17 hours on repeated doses. Carbamazepine is metabolized in the liver. Cytochrome P450 3A4 was identified as the major isoform responsible for the formation of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide from carbamazepine. After oral administration of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-carbamazepine, 72% of the administered radioactivity was found in the urine and 28% in the feces. This urinary radioactivity was composed largely of hydroxylated and conjugated metabolites, with only 3% of unchanged carbamazepine.</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetic parameters of carbamazepine disposition are similar in children and in adults. However, there is a poor correlation between plasma concentrations of carbamazepine and carbamazepine dose in children. Carbamazepine is more rapidly metabolized to carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (a metabolite shown to be equipotent to carbamazepine as an anticonvulsant in animal screens) in the younger age groups than in adults. In children below the age of 15, there is an inverse relationship between CBZ-E/CBZ ratio and increasing age (in one report from 0.44 in children below the age of 1 year to 0.18 in children between 10 - 15 years of age).</p>
<p>The effects of race and gender on carbamazepine pharmacokinetics have not been systematically evaluated.</p>

<a name="section-7.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Serious Dermatologic Reactions</h2>
<p class="First">Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443754" conceptname="Lyell's toxic epidermal necrolysis, subepidermal type">toxic epidermal necrolysis</span> (TEN) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="141651" conceptname="Stevens-Johnson syndrome">Stevens-Johnson syndrome</span> (SJS), have been reported with carbamazepine treatment. The risk of these events is estimated to be about 1 to 6 per 10,000 new users in countries with mainly Caucasian populations. However, the risk in some Asian countries is estimated to be about 10 times higher. Carbamazepine should be discontinued at the first sign of a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>, unless the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-7.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>SJS/TEN and HLA-B*1502 Allele</h2>
<p class="First">Retrospective case-control studies have found that in patients of Chinese ancestry there is a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN with carbamazepine treatment and the presence of an inherited variant of the HLA-B gene, HLA-B*1502. The occurrence of higher rates of these reactions in countries with higher frequencies of this allele suggests that the risk may be increased in allele-positive individuals of any ethnicity.</p>
<p>Across Asian populations, notable variation exists in the prevalence of HLA-B*1502. Greater than 15% of the population is reported positive in Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, and parts of the Philippines, compared to about 10% in Taiwan and 4% in North China. South Asians, including Indians, appear to have intermediate prevalence of HLA-B*1502, averaging 2 to 4%, but higher in some groups. HLA-B*1502 is present in &lt;1% of the population in Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>HLA-B*1502 is largely absent in individuals not of Asian origin (e.g., Caucasians, African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Prior to initiating carbamazepine therapy, testing for HLA-B*1502 should be performed in patients with ancestry in populations in which HLA-B*1502 may be present. </span>In deciding which patients to screen, the rates provided above for the prevalence of HLA-B*1502 may offer a rough guide, keeping in mind the limitations of these figures due to wide variability in rates even within ethnic groups, the difficulty in ascertaining ethnic ancestry, and the likelihood of mixed ancestry. Carbamazepine should not be used in patients positive for HLA-B*1502 unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Tested patients who are found to be negative for the allele are thought to have a low risk of SJS/TEN (see<span class="Bold"><a href="#WARNINGS"> WARNINGS </a></span>and<span class="Bold"><a href="#Laboratory"> PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests</a></span>).</p>
<p>Over 90% of carbamazepine treated patients who will experience SJS/TEN have this reaction within the first few months of treatment. This information may be taken into consideration in determining the need for screening of genetically at-risk patients currently on carbamazepine.</p>
<p>The HLA-B*1502 allele has not been found to predict risk of less severe adverse cutaneous reactions from carbamazepine, such as anticonvulsant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="45765791" conceptname="Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms">hypersensitivity syndrome</span> or nonserious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> (maculopapular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">eruption</span> [MPE]).</p>
<p>Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Chinese ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN. Consideration should be given to avoiding use of other drugs associated with SJS/TEN in HLA-B* 1502 positive patients, when alternative therapies are otherwise equally acceptable.</p>
<p>Application of HLA-B*1502 genotyping as a screening tool has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. Many HLA-B*1502-positive Asian patients treated with carbamazepine will not develop SJS/TEN, and these reactions can still occur infrequently in HLA-B*1502-negative patients of any ethnicity. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322252" conceptname="Suicidal behavior">Suicidal Behavior</span> and Ideation</h2>
<p class="First">Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including carbamazepine, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</p>
<p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322252" conceptname="Suicidal behavior">suicidal behavior</span> or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>.</p>
<p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</p>
<p>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</p>

<p class="First">Carbamazepine has shown mild anticholinergic activity; therefore, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4011560" conceptname="Raised intraocular pressure">increased intraocular pressure</span> should be closely observed during therapy.</p>
<p>Because of the relationship of the drug to other tricyclic compounds, the possibility of activation of a latent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychosis</span> and, in elderly patients, of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span> should be borne in mind.</p>

<h2>Usage in Pregnancy</h2>
<p class="First">Carbamazepine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.</p>
<p>Epidemiological data suggest that there may be an association between the use of carbamazepine during pregnancy and congenital malformations, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4283381" conceptname="Spina bifida">spina bifida</span>. There have also been reports that associate carbamazepine with developmental disorders and congenital anomalies (e.g., craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196528" conceptname="Hypospadias">hypospadias</span> and anomalies involving various body systems). <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436077" conceptname="Developmental delay">Developmental delays</span> based on neurobehavioral assessments have been reported. In treating or counseling women of childbearing potential, the prescribing physician will wish to weigh the benefits of therapy against the risks. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.</p>
<p>Retrospective case reviews suggest that, compared with monotherapy, there may be a higher prevalence of teratogenic effects associated with the use of anticonvulsants in combination therapy. Therefore, if therapy is to be continued, monotherapy may be preferable for pregnant women.</p>
<p>In humans, transplacental passage of carbamazepine is rapid (30 - 60 minutes), and the drug is accumulated in the fetal tissues, with higher levels found in liver and kidney than in brain and lung.</p>
<p>Carbamazepine has been shown to have adverse effects in reproduction studies in rats when given orally in dosages 10 - 25 times the maximum human daily dosage (MHDD) of 1200 mg on a mg/kg basis or 1.5 - 4 times the MHDD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. In rat teratology studies, 2 of 135 offspring showed kinked ribs at 250 mg/kg and 4 of 119 offspring at 650 mg/kg showed other anomalies (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135923" conceptname="Cleft palate">cleft palate</span>, 1; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134730" conceptname="Talipes">talipes</span>, 1; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434143" conceptname="Anophthalmos">anophthalmos</span>, 2). In reproduction studies in rats, nursing offspring demonstrated a lack of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span> and an unkempt appearance at a maternal dosage level of 200 mg/kg.</p>
<p>Antiepileptic drugs should not be discontinued abruptly in patients in whom the drug is administered to prevent major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> because of the strong possibility of precipitating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span> with attendant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxia</span> and threat to life. In individual cases where the severity and frequency of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> disorder are such that removal of medication does not pose a serious threat to the patient, discontinuation of the drug may be considered prior to and during pregnancy, although it cannot be said with any confidence that even minor <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> do not pose some hazard to the developing embryo or fetus.</p>
<p>Tests to detect defects using currently accepted procedures should be considered a part of routine prenatal care in childbearing women receiving carbamazepine.</p>
<p>There have been a few cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380533" conceptname="Convulsions in the newborn">neonatal seizures</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> associated with maternal carbamazepine and other concomitant anticonvulsant drug use. A few cases of neonatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, and/or decreased feeding have also been reported in association with maternal carbamazepine use. These symptoms may represent a neonatal withdrawal syndrome.</p>
<p>To provide information regarding the effects of in utero exposure to carbamazepine, physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking carbamazepine enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/.</p>

<a name="General"></a><a name="section-8.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Before initiating therapy, a detailed history and physical examination should be made.</p>
<p>Carbamazepine should be used with caution in patients with a mixed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> disorder that includes atypical absence <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>, since in these patients carbamazepine has been associated with increased frequency of generalized <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> (see<a href="#IU"> INDICATIONS AND USAGE</a>).</p>
<p>Therapy should be prescribed only after critical benefit-to-risk appraisal in patients with a history of cardiac conduction disturbance, including second and third degree AV <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316135" conceptname="Atrioventricular block">heart block</span>; cardiac, hepatic, or renal damage; adverse hematologic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reaction</span> to other drugs, including reactions to other anticonvulsants; or interrupted courses of therapy with carbamazepine.</p>
<p>AV <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316135" conceptname="Atrioventricular block">heart block</span>, including second and third degree block, have been reported following carbamazepine treatment. This occurred generally, but not solely, in patients with underlying EKG abnormalities or risk factors for conduction disturbances.</p>
<p>Hepatic effects, ranging from slight elevations in liver enzymes to rare cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic failure</span> have been reported (see<a href="#AR"> ADVERSE REACTIONS </a>and<a href="#Laboratory"> PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests</a>). In some cases, hepatic effects may progress despite discontinuation of the drug.</p>
<p>Multiorgan <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span> which can affect the skin, liver, hemopoietic organs and lymphatic system or other organs and occurring days to weeks or months after initiating treatment have been reported in rare cases (see<a href="#AR_Other"> ADVERSE REACTIONS, Other </a>and<a href="#Information"> PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients</a>).</p>
<p>Discontinuation of carbamazepine should be considered if any evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> develops.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">Hypersensitivity reactions</span> to carbamazepine have been reported in patients who previously experienced this reaction to anticonvulsants including phenytoin and phenobarbital. A history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span> should be obtained for a patient and the immediate family members. If positive, caution should be used in prescribing carbamazepine.</p>
<p>In patients who have exhibited <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span> to carbamazepine approximately 25 to 30% of these patients may experience <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span> with oxcarbazepine.</p>
<p>Since a given dose of carbamazepine suspension will produce higher peak levels than the same dose given as the tablet, it is recommended that patients given the suspension be started on lower doses and increased slowly to avoid unwanted side effects (see<a href="#DA"> DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>
<p>Carbamazepine chewable tablets and suspension contain sorbitol and, therefore, should not be administered to patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance.</p>

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Patients should be informed of the availability of a Medication Guide and they should be instructed to read the Medication Guide before taking carbamazepine.</p>
<p>Patients should be made aware of the early toxic signs and symptoms of a potential hematologic problem, as well as dermatologic, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="26711" conceptname="Chronic pharyngitis">sore throat</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcers</span> in the mouth, easy <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441737" conceptname="Contusion">bruising</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315085" conceptname="Lymphadenopathy">lymphadenopathy</span> and petechial or purpuric <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">hemorrhage</span>, and in the case of liver reactions, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">anorexia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span>. The patient should be advised that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, the patient should be advised that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use.</p>
<p>Patients, their caregivers, and families should be counseled that AEDs, including carbamazepine, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised that serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089139" conceptname="Skin reaction">skin reactions</span> have been reported in association with carbamazepine. In the event a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089139" conceptname="Skin reaction">skin reaction</span> should occur while taking carbamazepine, patients should consult with their physician immediately (see<a href="#WARNINGS"> WARNINGS</a>).</p>
<p>Carbamazepine may interact with some drugs. Therefore, patients should be advised to report to their doctors the use of any other prescription or nonprescription medications or herbal products.</p>
<p>Caution should be exercised if alcohol is taken in combination with carbamazepine therapy, due to a possible additive sedative effect.</p>
<p>Since <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> may occur, patients should be cautioned about the hazards of operating machinery or automobiles or engaging in other potentially dangerous tasks.</p>
<p>Patients should be encouraged to enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. To enroll, patients can call the toll free number 1-888-233-2334 (see<a href="#WAR_uip"> WARNINGS, Usage in Pregnancy </a>subsection).</p>

<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">For genetically at-risk patients (see<a href="#WARNINGS"> WARNINGS</a>), high-resolution<span class="Italics"> 'HLA-B*1502 typing' </span>is recommended. The test is positive if either one or two HLA-B*1502 alleles are detected and negative if no HLA-B*1502 alleles are detected.</p>
<p>Complete pretreatment blood counts, including platelets and possibly reticulocytes and serum iron, should be obtained as a baseline. If a patient in the course of treatment exhibits low or decreased white blood cell or platelet counts, the patient should be monitored closely. Discontinuation of the drug should be considered if any evidence of significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4145241" conceptname="Bone marrow depression">bone marrow depression</span> develops.</p>
<p>Baseline and periodic evaluations of liver function, particularly in patients with a history of liver disease, must be performed during treatment with this drug since <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver damage</span> may occur (see<a href="#General"> PRECAUTIONS, General </a>and<a href="#AR"> ADVERSE REACTIONS</a>). Carbamazepine should be discontinued, based on clinical judgment, if indicated by newly occurring or worsening clinical or laboratory evidence of liver dysfunction or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">hepatic damage</span>, or in the case of active liver disease.</p>
<p>Baseline and periodic eye examinations, including slit-lamp, funduscopy, and tonometry, are recommended since many phenothiazines and related drugs have been shown to cause eye changes.</p>
<p>Baseline and periodic complete urinalysis and BUN determinations are recommended for patients treated with this agent because of observed renal dysfunction.</p>
<p>Monitoring of blood levels (see<a href="#CP"> CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>) has increased the efficacy and safety of anticonvulsants. This monitoring may be particularly useful in cases of dramatic increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> frequency and for verification of compliance. In addition, measurement of drug serum levels may aid in determining the cause of toxicity when more than one medication is being used.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4261836" conceptname="Thyroid panel">Thyroid function tests</span> have been reported to show decreased values with carbamazepine administered alone.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">Hyponatremia</span> has been reported in association with carbamazepine use, either alone or in combination with other drugs.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">There has been a report of a patient who passed an orange rubbery precipitate in his stool the day after ingesting carbamazepine suspension immediately followed by Thorazine<span class="Sup">®</span>* solution. Subsequent testing has shown that mixing carbamazepine suspension and chlorpromazine solution (both generic and brand name) as well as carbamazepine suspension and liquid Mellaril<span class="Sup">®</span>* resulted in the occurrence of this precipitate. Because the extent to which this occurs with other liquid medications is not known, carbamazepine suspension should not be administered simultaneously with other liquid medicinal agents or diluents (See<a href="#DA"> DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>
<p>Clinically meaningful drug interactions have occurred with concomitant medications and include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-8.4.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Agents That May Affect Carbamazepine Plasma Levels</h3>
<p class="First">CYP 3A4 inhibitors inhibit carbamazepine metabolism and can thus increase plasma carbamazepine levels. Drugs that have been shown, or would be expected, to increase plasma carbamazepine levels include:</p>
<dl>
<dt> </dt>
<dd>cimetidine, danazol, diltiazem, macrolides, erythromycin, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, nefazodone, trazodone, loxapine<a name="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1" class="Sup">1</a>, olanzapine, quetiapine<a href="#footnote-1" class="Sup">1</a>, loratadine, terfenadine, omeprazole, oxybutynin, dantrolene, isoniazid, niacinamide, nicotinamide, ibuprofen, propoxyphene, azoles (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, voriconazole), acetazolamide, verapamil, ticlopidine, grapefruit juice, protease inhibitors, valproate<a href="#footnote-1" class="Sup">1</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>CYP 3A4 inducers can increase the rate of carbamazepine metabolism. Drugs that have been shown, or that would be expected, to decrease plasma carbamazepine levels include:</p>
<dl>
<dt> </dt>
<dd>cisplatin, doxorubicin HCl, felbamate, fosphenytoin, rifampin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, methsuximide, theophylline, aminophylline.</dd>
</dl>
<p>When carbamazepine is given with drugs that can increase or decrease carbamazepine levels, close monitoring of carbamazepine levels is indicated and dosage adjustment may be required.</p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-8.4.2"></a><p></p>
<h3>Effect of Carbamazepine on Plasma Levels of Concomitant Agents</h3>
<p class="First">Increased levels: clomipramine HCl, phenytoin, primidone.</p>
<p>Carbamazepine is a potent inducer of hepatic CYP 3A4 and may therefore reduce plasma concentrations of comedications mainly metabolized by 3A4 through induction of their metabolism. Carbamazepine causes, or would be expected to cause, decreased levels of the following:</p>
<dl>
<dt> </dt>
<dd>acetaminophen, alprazolam, bupropion, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g., felodipine), citalopram, cyclosporine, corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone, dexamethasone), clonazepam, clozapine, dicumarol, doxycycline, ethosuximide, everolimus, haloperidol, imatinib, itraconazole, lamotrigine, levothyroxine, methadone, methsuximide, midazolam, olanzapine, oral and other hormonal contraceptives, oxcarbazepine, phensuximide, phenytoin, praziquantel, protease inhibitors, risperidone, theophylline, tiagabine, topiramate, tramadol, trazodone, tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., imipramine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline), valproate, warfarin, ziprasidone, zonisamide.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In concomitant use with carbamazepine, dosage adjustment of the above agents may be necessary.</p>
<p>Coadministration of carbamazepine with nefazodone results in insufficient plasma concentrations of nefazodone and its active metabolite to achieve a therapeutic effect. Coadministration of carbamazepine with nefazodone is contraindicated. (See<a href="#CONTRAINDICATIONS"> CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>).</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of carbamazepine and lithium may increase the risk of neurotoxic side effects.</p>
<p>Concomitant use of carbamazepine and isoniazid has been reported to increase isoniazidinduced hepatotoxicity.</p>
<p>Concomitant medication with carbamazepine and some diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide) may lead to symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">hyponatremia</span>.</p>
<p>Carbamazepine may antagonize the effects of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants (e.g., pancuronium).</p>
<p>Their dosage may need to be raised, and patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">neuromuscular blockade</span> than expected.</p>
<p>Alterations of thyroid function have been reported in combination therapy with other anticonvulsant medications.</p>
<p>Concomitant use of carbamazepine with hormonal contraceptive products (e.g., oral, and levonorgestrel subdermal implant contraceptives) may render the contraceptives less effective because the plasma concentrations of the hormones may be decreased. Breakthrough <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> and unintended pregnancies have been reported. Alternative or back-up methods of contraception should be considered.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Carbamazepine, when administered to Sprague-Dawley rats for two years in the diet at doses of 25, 75, and 250 mg/kg/day, resulted in a dose-related increase in the incidence of hepatocellular tumors in females and of benign interstitial cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> in the testes of males.</p>
<p>Carbamazepine must, therefore, be considered to be carcinogenic in Sprague-Dawley rats. Bacterial and mammalian mutagenicity studies using carbamazepine produced negative results. The significance of these findings relative to the use of carbamazepine in humans is, at present, unknown.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Carbamazepine and its epoxide metabolite are transferred to breast milk. The ratio of the concentration in breast milk to that in maternal plasma is about 0.4 for carbamazepine and about 0.5 for the epoxide. The estimated doses given to the newborn during breast-feeding are in the range of 2 - 5 mg daily for carbamazepine and 1 - 2 mg daily for the epoxide.</p>
<p>Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from carbamazepine, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<p>Taken as a whole, this information supports a conclusion that the generally accepted therapeutic range of total carbamazepine in plasma (i.e., 4 - 12 mcg/mL) is the same in children and adults.</p>
<p>The evidence assembled was primarily obtained from short-term use of carbamazepine. The safety of carbamazepine in children has been systematically studied up to 6 months. No longer-term data from clinical trials is available.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">(SEE<a href="#table"> TABLE </a>BELOW)</span></p>
<p>Carbamazepine suspension in combination with liquid chlorpromazine or thioridazine results in precipitate formation, and, in the case of chlorpromazine, there has been a report of a patient passing an orange rubbery precipitate in the stool following coadministration of the two drugs. (see<a href="#DI"> PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</a>). Because the extent to which this occurs with other liquid medications is not known, carbamazepine suspension should not be administered simultaneously with other liquid medications or diluents.</p>
<p>Monitoring of blood levels has increased the efficacy and safety of anticonvulsants (see<a href="#Laboratory"> PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests</a>). Dosage should be adjusted to the needs of the individual patient. A low initial daily dosage with a gradual increase is advised. As soon as adequate control is achieved, the dosage may be reduced very gradually to the minimum effective level. Medication should be taken with meals.</p>
<p>Since a given dose of carbamazepine suspension will produce higher peak levels than the same dose given as the tablet, it is recommended to start with low doses (children 6 to 12 years: 1/2 teaspoon q.i.d.) and to increase slowly to avoid unwanted side effects.</p>
<p>Conversion of patients from oral carbamazepine tablets to carbamazepine suspension: Patients should be converted by administering the same number of mg per day in smaller, more frequent doses (i.e., b.i.d. tablets to t.i.d. suspension).</p>
<p>Carbamazepine extended-release tablets is an extended-release formulation for twice-a-day administration. When converting patients from carbamazepine conventional tablets to carbamazepine extended-release tablets, the same total daily mg dose of carbamazepine extended-release tablets should be administered.<span class="Bold"> Carbamazepine extended-release tablets must be swallowed whole and never crushed or chewed. </span>Carbamazepine extended-release tablets should be inspected for chips or cracks. Damaged tablets should not be consumed.</p>

<p class="First">(SEE<a href="#IU"> INDICATIONS AND USAGE</a>)</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Adults and children over 12 years of age-Initial: </span>Either 200 mg b.i.d. for tablets and extended-release tablets, or 1 teaspoon q.i.d. for suspension (400 mg/day). Increase at weekly intervals by adding up to 200 mg/day using a b.i.d. regimen of carbamazepine extended-release tablets or a t.i.d. or q.i.d. regimen of the other formulations until the optimal response is obtained. Dosage generally should not exceed 1000 mg daily in children 12 to 15 years of age, and 1200 mg daily in patients above 15 years of age. Doses up to 1600 mg daily have been used in adults in rare instances.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Maintenance: </span>Adjust dosage to the minimum effective level, usually 800 to 1200 mg daily.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Children 6 to 12 years of age-Initial: </span>Either 100 mg b.i.d. for tablets or extended-release tablets, or 1/2 teaspoon q.i.d. for suspension (200 mg/day).

Increase weekly to achieve optimal clinical response administered t.i.d. or q.i.d.<span class="Bold Italics"> Maintenance: </span>Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 35 mg/kg. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the therapeutic range. No recommendation regarding the safety of carbamazepine for use at doses above 35 mg/kg/24 hours can be made.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Combination Therapy: </span>Carbamazepine may be used alone or with other anticonvulsants. When added to existing anticonvulsant therapy, the drug should be added gradually while the other anticonvulsants are maintained or gradually decreased, except phenytoin, which may have to be increased (see<a href="#DI"> PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions, </a>and<a href="#Pregnancy_D"> Pregnancy Category D</a>).</p>
