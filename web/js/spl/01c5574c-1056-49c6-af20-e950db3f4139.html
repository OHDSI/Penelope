<h2>Mechanism of Action:</h2>
<p class="First">HIV-1 protease is an enzyme required for the proteolytic cleavage of the viral polyprotein precursors into the individual functional proteins found in infectious HIV-1. Indinavir binds to the protease active site and inhibits the activity of the enzyme. This inhibition prevents cleavage of the viral polyproteins resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles.</p>

<h2>Antiretroviral Activity <span class="Italics">In Vitro</span> :</h2>
<p class="First">The <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> activity of indinavir was assessed in cell lines of lymphoblastic and monocytic origin and in peripheral blood <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span>. HIV-1 variants used to infect the different cell types include laboratory-adapted variants, primary clinical isolates and clinical isolates resistant to nucleoside analogue and nonnucleoside inhibitors of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. The IC<span class="Sub">95</span> (95% inhibitory concentration) of indinavir in these test systems was in the range of 25 to 100 nM. In drug combination studies with the nucleoside analogues zidovudine and didanosine, indinavir showed synergistic activity in cell culture. The relationship between <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> susceptibility of HIV-1 to indinavir and inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans has not been established.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4150981" conceptname="Drug resistance">Drug Resistance</span>:</h2>
<p class="First">Isolates of HIV-1 with reduced susceptibility to the drug have been recovered from some patients treated with indinavir. Viral resistance was correlated with the accumulation of mutations that resulted in the expression of amino acid substitutions in the viral protease. Eleven amino acid residue positions, (L10l/V/R, K20l/M/R, L24l, M46l/L, l54A/V, L63P, l64V, A71T/V, V82A/F/T, l84V, and L90M), at which substitutions are associated with resistance, have been identified. Resistance was mediated by the co-expression of multiple and variable substitutions at these positions. No single substitution was either necessary or sufficient for measurable resistance (≥4-fold increase in IC<span class="Sub">95</span>). In general, higher levels of resistance were associated with the co-expression of greater numbers of substitutions, although their individual effects varied and were not additive. At least 3 amino acid substitutions must be present for phenotypic resistance to indinavir to reach measurable levels. In addition, mutations in the p7/ p1 and p1/ p6 gag cleavage sites were observed in some indinavir resistant HIV-1 isolates.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> phenotypic susceptibilities to indinavir were determined for 38 viral isolates from 13 patients who experienced virologic rebounds during indinavir monotherapy. Pre-treatment isolates from five patients exhibited indinavir IC<span class="Sub">95</span> values of 50-100 nM. At or following viral RNA rebound (after 12-76 weeks of therapy), IC<span class="Sub">95</span> values ranged from 25 to &gt;3000 nM, and the viruses carried 2 to 10 mutations in the protease gene relative to baseline.</p>

<h2>Cross-Resistance to Other Antiviral Agents: </h2>
<p class="First">Varying degrees of HIV-1 cross-resistance have been observed between indinavir and other HIV-1 protease inhibitors. In studies with ritonavir, saquinavir, and amprenavir, the extent and spectrum of cross-resistance varied with the specific mutational patterns observed. In general, the degree of cross-resistance increased with the accumulation of resistance-associated amino acid substitutions. Within a panel of 29 viral isolates from indinavir-treated patients that exhibited measurable (≥4-fold) phenotypic resistance to indinavir, all were resistant to ritonavir. Of the indinavir resistant HIV-1 isolates, 63% showed resistance to saquinavir and 81% to amprenavir.</p>

<h3>Absorption:</h3>
<p class="First">Indinavir was rapidly absorbed in the fasted state with a time to peak plasma concentration (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) of 0.8 ± 0.3 hours (mean ± S.D.) (n=11). A greater than dose-proportional increase in indinavir plasma concentrations was observed over the 200-1000 mg dose range. At a dosing regimen of 800 mg every 8 hours, steady-state area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) was 30,691 ± 11,407 nM•hour (n=16), peak plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) was 12,617 ± 4037 nM (n=16), and plasma concentration eight hours post dose (trough) was 251 ± 178 nM (n=16).</p>

<h4>Effect of Food on Oral Absorption:</h4>
<p class="First">Administration of indinavir with a meal high in calories, fat, and protein (784 kcal, 48.6 g fat, 31.3 g protein) resulted in a 77% ± 8% reduction in AUC and an 84% ± 7% reduction in C<span class="Sub">max</span> (n=10). Administration with lighter meals (e.g., a meal of dry toast with jelly, apple juice, and coffee with skim milk and sugar or a meal of corn flakes, skim milk and sugar) resulted in little or no change in AUC, C<span class="Sub">max</span> or trough concentration.</p>

<h3>Metabolism:</h3>
<p class="First">Following a 400-mg dose of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-indinavir, 83 ± 1% (n=4) and 19 ± 3% (n=6) of the total radioactivity was recovered in feces and urine, respectively; radioactivity due to parent drug in feces and urine was 19.1% and 9.4%, respectively. Seven metabolites have been identified, one glucuronide conjugate and six oxidative metabolites. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies indicate that cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is the major enzyme responsible for formation of the oxidative metabolites.</p>

<h3>Elimination:</h3>
<p class="First">Less than 20% of indinavir is excreted unchanged in the urine. Mean urinary excretion of unchanged drug was 10.4 ± 4.9% (n=10) and 12.0 ± 4.9% (n=10) following a single 700-mg and 1000-mg dose, respectively. Indinavir was rapidly eliminated with a half-life of 1.8 ± 0.4 hours (n=10). Significant accumulation was not observed after multiple dosing at 800 mg every 8 hours.</p>

<h3>Gender:</h3>
<p class="First">The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of indinavir was evaluated in 10 HIV seropositive women who received CRIXIVAN 800 mg every 8 hours with zidovudine 200 mg every 8 hours and lamivudine 150 mg twice a day for one week. Indinavir pharmacokinetic parameters in these women were compared to those in HIV seropositive men (pooled historical control data). Differences in indinavir exposure, peak concentrations, and trough concentrations between males and females are shown in Table 1 below:</p>

<h3>Pediatric:</h3>
<p class="First">The optimal dosing regimen for use of indinavir in pediatric patients has not been established. In HIV-infected pediatric patients (age 4-15 years), a dosage regimen of indinavir capsules, 500 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> every 8 hours, produced AUC<span class="Sub">0-8hr</span> of 38,742 ± 24,098 nM•hour (n=34), C<span class="Sub">max</span> of 17,181 ± 9809 nM (n=34), and trough concentrations of 134 ± 91 nM (n=28). The pharmacokinetic profiles of indinavir in pediatric patients were not comparable to profiles previously observed in HIV-infected adults receiving the recommended dose of 800 mg every 8 hours. The AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> values were slightly higher and the trough concentrations were considerably lower in pediatric patients. Approximately 50% of the pediatric patients had trough values below 100 nM; whereas, approximately 10% of adult patients had trough levels below 100 nM. The relationship between specific trough values and inhibition of HIV replication has not been established.</p>

<h3>Pregnant Patients:</h3>
<p class="First">The optimal dosing regimen for use of indinavir in pregnant patients has not been established. A CRIXIVAN dose of 800 mg every 8 hours (with zidovudine 200 mg every 8 hours and lamivudine 150 mg twice a day) has been studied in 16 HIV-infected pregnant patients at 14 to 28 weeks of gestation at enrollment (study PACTG 358). The mean indinavir plasma AUC<span class="Sub">0-8hr </span>at weeks 30-32 of gestation (n=11) was 9231 nM•hr, which is 74% (95% CI: 50%, 86%) lower than that observed 6 weeks postpartum. Six of these 11 (55%) patients had mean indinavir plasma concentrations 8 hours post-dose (C<span class="Sub">min</span>) below assay threshold of reliable quantification. The pharmacokinetics of indinavir in these 11 patients at 6 weeks postpartum were generally similar to those observed in non-pregnant patients in another study (see <a href="#i4i_pregnancy_id_77c8b9d9-0222-43e4-8eca-a9a26c5eee3a">PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy</a>).</p>

<p>Indinavir is an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 isoform CYP3A4. Coadministration of CRIXIVAN and drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 may result in increased plasma concentrations of the other drug, which could increase or prolong its therapeutic and adverse effects (see <a href="#i4i_contraindications_id_b5bc718d-8818-4315-9cdb-a1b17f18e22a">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a> and <a href="#i4i_warnings_id_738713d2-f705-4a9d-a57f-221954ddf33a">WARNINGS</a>). Based on <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>data in human liver microsomes, indinavir does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2E1 and CYP2B6. However, indinavir may be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6.</p>
<p>Indinavir is metabolized by CYP3A4. Drugs that induce CYP3A4 activity would be expected to increase the clearance of indinavir, resulting in lowered plasma concentrations of indinavir. Coadministration of CRIXIVAN and other drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may decrease the clearance of indinavir and may result in increased plasma concentrations of indinavir.</p>

<h2>Description of Studies</h2>
<p class="First">In all clinical studies, with the exception of ACTG 320, the AMPLICOR HIV MONITOR assay was used to determine the level of circulating HIV RNA in serum. This is an experimental use of the assay. HIV RNA results should not be directly compared to results from other trials using different HIV RNA assays or using other sample sources.</p>
<p>Study ACTG 320 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical endpoint trial to compare the effect of CRIXIVAN in combination with zidovudine and lamivudine with that of zidovudine plus lamivudine on the progression to an AIDS-defining illness (ADI) or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. Patients were protease inhibitor and lamivudine naive and zidovudine experienced, with CD4 cell counts of ≤200 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>. The study enrolled 1156 HIV-infected patients (17% female, 28% Black, 18% Hispanic, mean age 39 years). The mean baseline CD4 cell count was 87 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>. The mean baseline HIV RNA was 4.95 log<span class="Sub">10</span> copies/mL (89,035 copies/mL). The study was terminated after a planned interim analysis, resulting in a median follow-up of 38 weeks and a maximum follow-up of 52 weeks. Results are shown in Table 4 and Figures 1 &amp; 2.</p>

All patients were antiretroviral naive with CD4 cell counts of 50 to 250 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>. The study enrolled 996 HIV-1 seropositive patients [28% female, 11% Black, 1% Asian/Other, median age 33 years, mean baseline CD4 cell count of 152 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>, mean serum viral RNA of 4.44 log<span class="Sub">10</span> copies/mL (27,824 copies/mL)]. Treatment regimens containing zidovudine were modified in a blinded manner with the optional addition of lamivudine (median time: week 40). The median length of follow-up was 56 weeks with a maximum of 97 weeks. The study was terminated after a planned interim analysis, resulting in a median follow-up of 56 weeks and a maximum follow-up of 97 weeks. Results are shown in Table 5 and Figures 3 and 4.<br><br></p>

<p>Study 035 was a multicenter, randomized trial in 97 HIV-1 seropositive patients who were zidovudine-experienced (median exposure 30 months), protease-inhibitor- and lamivudine-naive, with mean baseline CD4 count 175 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> and mean baseline serum viral RNA 4.62 log<span class="Sub">10</span> copies/mL (41,230 copies/mL). Comparisons included CRIXIVAN plus zidovudine plus lamivudine vs. CRIXIVAN alone vs. zidovudine plus lamivudine. After at least 24 weeks of randomized, double-blind therapy, patients were switched to open-label CRIXIVAN plus lamivudine plus zidovudine. Mean changes in log<span class="Sub">10</span> viral RNA in serum, the proportions of patients with viral RNA below 500 copies/mL in serum, and mean changes in CD4 cell counts, during 24 weeks of randomized, double-blinded therapy are summarized in Figures 5, 6, and 7, respectively. A limited number of patients remained on randomized, double-blind treatment for longer periods; based on this extended treatment experience, it appears that a greater number of subjects randomized to CRIXIVAN plus zidovudine plus lamivudine demonstrated HIV RNA levels below 500 copies/mL during one year of therapy as compared to those in other treatment groups.</p>

<h2>Genotypic Resistance in Clinical Studies</h2>
<p class="First">Study 006 (10/15/93-10/12/94) was a dose-ranging study in which patients were initially treated with CRIXIVAN at a dose of &lt;2.4 g/day followed by 2.4 g/day. Study 019 (6/23/94-4/10/95) was a randomized comparison of CRIXIVAN 600 mg every 6 hours, CRIXIVAN plus zidovudine, and zidovudine alone.

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Concomitant use of CRIXIVAN with lovastatin, simvastatin, or rosuvastatin is not recommended. Caution should be exercised if HIV protease inhibitors, including CRIXIVAN, are used concurrently with atorvastatin. The interaction of CRIXIVAN with pravastatin and fluvastatin is not known. The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137275" conceptname="Disorder of muscle">myopathy</span> including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4230337" conceptname="Rhabdomyolysis">rhabdomyolysis</span> may be increased when HIV protease inhibitors, including CRIXIVAN, are used in combination with these statin drugs (see <a href="#i4i_interactions_id_1c62db58-551e-4bce-a628-10e35868b57f">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</a>).</p>
<p>Midazolam is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4. Co-administration with CRIXIVAN with or without ritonavir may cause a large increase in the concentration of this benzodiazepine. No drug interaction study has been performed for the co-administration of CRIXIVAN with benzodiazepines. Based on data from other CYP3A4 inhibitors, plasma concentrations of midazolam are expected to be significantly higher when midazolam is given orally. Therefore CRIXIVAN should not be co-administered with orally administered midazolam (see <a href="#i4i_contraindications_id_b5bc718d-8818-4315-9cdb-a1b17f18e22a">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>), whereas caution should be used with co-administration of CRIXIVAN and parenteral midazolam. Data from concomitant use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors suggest a possible 3-4 fold increase in midazolam plasma levels. If CRIXIVAN with or without ritonavir is co-administered with parenteral midazolam, it should be done in a setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> and/or prolonged sedation. Dosage reduction for midazolam should be considered, especially if more than a single dose of midazolam is administered.</p>
<p>Particular caution should be used when prescribing sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil in patients receiving indinavir. Coadministration of CRIXIVAN with these medications is expected to substantially increase plasma concentrations of sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil and may result in an increase in adverse events, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, visual changes, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315586" conceptname="Priapism">priapism</span>, which have been associated with sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil (see <a href="#i4i_contraindications_id_b5bc718d-8818-4315-9cdb-a1b17f18e22a">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a> and <a href="#i4i_interactions_id_1c62db58-551e-4bce-a628-10e35868b57f">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</a> and <a href="#i4i_info_patients_id_bb7317c6-6302-49fc-9364-73c93f9bda85">Information for Patients</a>, and the manufacturer’s complete prescribing information for sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil).</p>
<p>Concomitant use of CRIXIVAN and St. John’s wort (<span class="Italics">Hypericum perforatum</span>) or products containing St. John’s wort is not recommended. Coadministration of CRIXIVAN and St. John’s wort has been shown to substantially decrease indinavir concentrations (see <a href="#i4i_interactions_id_f3ad8ec4-4263-401e-b541-0e37ff80cd48">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Drug Interactions)</a> and may lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to CRIXIVAN or to the class of protease inhibitors.</p>

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">A statement to patients and health care providers is included on the product’s bottle label. <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">ALERT: Find out about medicines that should NOT be taken with CRIXIVAN.</span></span> A Patient Package Insert (PPI) for CRIXIVAN is available for patient information.</p>
<p>CRIXIVAN is not a cure for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439727" conceptname="Human immunodeficiency virus infection">HIV infection</span> and patients may continue to develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4247535" conceptname="Opportunistic infectious disease">opportunistic infections</span> and other complications associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439727" conceptname="Human immunodeficiency virus infection">HIV disease</span>. The long-term effects of CRIXIVAN are unknown at this time. CRIXIVAN has not been shown to reduce the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or blood contamination.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised to remain under the care of a physician when using CRIXIVAN and should not modify or discontinue treatment without first consulting the physician. Therefore, if a dose is missed, patients should take the next dose at the regularly scheduled time and should not double this dose. Therapy with CRIXIVAN should be initiated and maintained at the recommended dosage.</p>
<p>CRIXIVAN may interact with some drugs; therefore, patients should be advised to report to their doctor the use of any other prescription, non-prescription medication or herbal products, particularly St. John’s wort.</p>
<p>For optimal absorption, CRIXIVAN should be administered without food but with water 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. Alternatively, CRIXIVAN may be administered with other liquids such as skim milk, juice, coffee, or tea, or with a light meal, e.g., dry toast with jelly, juice, and coffee with skim milk and sugar; or corn flakes, skim milk and sugar (see <a href="#i4i_section_id_befae14c-d9db-44b3-b584-2c15056af872">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Effect of Food on Oral Absorption</a> and <a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_cd9e75f2-1abe-4e68-ab5c-308b69097725">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>). Ingestion of CRIXIVAN with a meal high in calories, fat, and protein reduces the absorption of indinavir.</p>
<p>Patients receiving a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor (sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil) should be advised that they may be at an increased risk of PDE5 inhibitor-associated adverse events including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, visual changes, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315586" conceptname="Priapism">priapism</span>, and should promptly report any symptoms to their doctors ( see <a href="#i4i_contraindications_id_b5bc718d-8818-4315-9cdb-a1b17f18e22a">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a> and <a href="#i4i_interactions_id_dbb6d01f-6f90-4405-929a-94c63da38106">WARNINGS, Drug Interactions</a>).</p>
<p>Patients should be informed that redistribution or accumulation of body fat may occur in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy and that the cause and long-term health effects of these conditions are not known at this time.</p>
<p>CRIXIVAN Capsules are sensitive to moisture. Patients should be informed that CRIXIVAN should be stored and used in the original container and the desiccant should remain in the bottle.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Indinavir is an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 isoform CYP3A4. Coadministration of CRIXIVAN and drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 may result in increased plasma concentrations of the other drug, which could increase or prolong its therapeutic and adverse effects (see <a href="#i4i_contraindications_id_b5bc718d-8818-4315-9cdb-a1b17f18e22a">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a> and <a href="#i4i_warnings_id_738713d2-f705-4a9d-a57f-221954ddf33a">WARNINGS</a>).</p>
<p>Indinavir is metabolized by CYP3A4. Drugs that induce CYP3A4 activity would be expected to increase the clearance of indinavir, resulting in lowered plasma concentrations of indinavir. Coadministration of CRIXIVAN and other drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may decrease the clearance of indinavir and may result in increased plasma concentrations of indinavir.<br><br></p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats. In mice, no increased incidence of any tumor type was observed. The highest dose tested in rats was 640 mg/kg/day; at this dose a statistically significant increased incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4114219" conceptname="Thyroid adenoma">thyroid adenomas</span> was seen only in male rats. At that dose, daily systemic exposure in rats was approximately 1.3 times higher than daily systemic exposure in humans.

No treatment-related effects on mating, fertility, or embryo survival were seen in female rats and no treatment-related effects on mating performance were seen in male rats at doses providing systemic exposure comparable to or slightly higher than that with the clinical dose. In addition, no treatment-related effects were observed in fecundity or fertility of untreated females mated to treated males.</p>

<h3>Pregnancy Category C:</h3>
<p class="First">Developmental toxicity studies were performed in rabbits (at doses up to 240 mg/kg/day), dogs (at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day), and rats (at doses up to 640 mg/kg/day). The highest doses in these studies produced systemic exposures in these species comparable to or slightly greater than human exposure. No treatment-related external, visceral, or skeletal changes were observed in rabbits or dogs. No treatment-related external or visceral changes were observed in rats. Treatment-related increases over controls in the incidence of supernumerary ribs (at exposures at or below those in humans) and of cervical ribs (at exposures comparable to or slightly greater than those in humans) were seen in rats. In all three species, no treatment-related effects on embryonic/fetal survival or fetal weights were observed.</p>
<p>In rabbits, at a maternal dose of 240 mg/kg/day, no drug was detected in fetal plasma 1 hour after dosing. Fetal plasma drug levels 2 hours after dosing were approximately 3% of maternal plasma drug levels. In dogs, at a maternal dose of 80 mg/kg/day, fetal plasma drug levels were approximately 50% of maternal plasma drug levels both 1 and 2 hours after dosing. In rats, at maternal doses of 40 and 640 mg/kg/day, fetal plasma drug levels were approximately 10 to 15% and 10 to 20% of maternal plasma drug levels 1 and 2 hours after dosing, respectively.</p>
<p>Indinavir was administered to Rhesus monkeys during the third trimester of pregnancy (at doses up to 160 mg/kg twice daily) and to neonatal Rhesus monkeys (at doses up to 160 mg/kg twice daily). When administered to neonates, indinavir caused an exacerbation of the transient physiologic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4032334" conceptname="Hyperbilirubinemia">hyperbilirubinemia</span> seen in this species after birth; serum bilirubin values were approximately fourfold above controls at 160 mg/kg twice daily. A similar exacerbation did not occur in neonates after <span class="Italics">in utero</span> exposure to indinavir during the third trimester of pregnancy. In Rhesus monkeys, fetal plasma drug levels were approximately 1 to 2% of maternal plasma drug levels approximately 1 hour after maternal dosing at 40, 80, or 160 mg/kg twice daily.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4032334" conceptname="Hyperbilirubinemia">Hyperbilirubinemia</span> has occurred during treatment with CRIXIVAN (see <a href="#i4i_precautions_id_201fa1b2-e4a1-4f5c-a269-92235e35ed61">PRECAUTIONS</a> and <a href="#i4i_adverse_effects_id_14ef45b9-1a34-4dc7-b514-7c9468454213">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a>). It is unknown whether CRIXIVAN administered to the mother in the perinatal period will exacerbate physiologic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4032334" conceptname="Hyperbilirubinemia">hyperbilirubinemia</span> in neonates. </p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant patients. CRIXIVAN should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<p>A CRIXIVAN dose of 800 mg every 8 hours (with zidovudine 200 mg every 8 hours and lamivudine 150 mg twice a day) has been studied in 16 HIV-infected pregnant patients at 14 to 28 weeks of gestation at enrollment (study PACTG 358). Given the substantially lower antepartum exposures observed and the limited data in this patient population, indinavir use is not recommended in HIV-infected pregnant patients (see <a href="#i4i_pregnancy_id_fe128d10-0fdc-44e0-84e4-471cb9f9e73f">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pregnant Patients</a>).</p>

<h3>Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry</h3>
<p class="First">To monitor maternal-fetal outcomes of pregnant patients exposed to CRIXIVAN, an Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to register patients by calling 1-800-258-4263.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Studies in lactating rats have demonstrated that indinavir is excreted in milk. Although it is not known whether CRIXIVAN is excreted in human milk, there exists the potential for adverse effects from indinavir in nursing infants. Mothers should be instructed to discontinue nursing if they are receiving CRIXIVAN. This is consistent with the recommendation by the U.S. Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that HIV-infected mothers not breast-feed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV.</p>

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">The optimal dosing regimen for use of indinavir in pediatric patients has not been established. A dose of 500 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> every eight hours has been studied in uncontrolled studies of 70 children, 3 to 18 years of age. The pharmacokinetic profiles of indinavir at this dose were <span class="Underline">not</span> comparable to profiles previously observed in adults receiving the recommended dose (see <a href="#i4i_pediatric_use_id_a907b0d6-101f-4c06-a831-b80a0fda24a3">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pediatric</a>). Although viral suppression was observed in some of the 32 children who were followed on this regimen through 24 weeks, a substantially higher rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201620" conceptname="Kidney stone">nephrolithiasis</span> was reported when compared to adult historical data (see <a href="#i4i_section_id_728aa208-0d58-48a2-8c41-effb298070c7">WARNINGS, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201620" conceptname="Kidney stone">Nephrolithiasis</span>/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79873" conceptname="Urolith">Urolithiasis</span></a>). Physicians considering the use of indinavir in pediatric patients without other protease inhibitor options should be aware of the limited data available in this population and the increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201620" conceptname="Kidney stone">nephrolithiasis</span>.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of CRIXIVAN did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>

The cumulative frequency of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201620" conceptname="Kidney stone">nephrolithiasis</span> events increases with duration of exposure to CRIXIVAN; however, the risk over time remains relatively constant.

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">The recommended dosage of CRIXIVAN is 800 mg (usually <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">two</span></span> 400-mg capsules) orally every 8 hours.</p>
<p>CRIXIVAN must be taken at intervals of 8 hours. For optimal absorption, CRIXIVAN should be administered without food but with water 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. Alternatively, CRIXIVAN may be administered with other liquids such as skim milk, juice, coffee, or tea, or with a light meal, e.g., dry toast with jelly, juice, and coffee with skim milk and sugar; or corn flakes, skim milk and sugar. (See <a href="#i4i_section_id_befae14c-d9db-44b3-b584-2c15056af872">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Effect of Food on Oral Absorption</a>.)</p>
<p>To ensure adequate hydration, it is recommended that adults drink at least 1.5 liters (approximately 48 ounces) of liquids during the course of 24 hours.</p>

<h2><span class="Underline"><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">What is CRIXIVAN?</span></span></span></h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">CRIXIVAN is an oral capsule used for the treatment of HIV (Human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433740" conceptname="Immunodeficiency disorder">Immunodeficiency</span> Virus). HIV is the virus that causes AIDS (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4267414" conceptname="AIDS">acquired immune deficiency syndrome</span>). </span></span>CRIXIVAN is a type of HIV drug called a protease (PRO-tee-ase) inhibitor.</p>

<h2><span class="Underline"><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">How does CRIXIVAN work?</span></span></span></h2>
<p class="First">CRIXIVAN is a protease inhibitor that fights HIV. CRIXIVAN can help reduce your chances of getting illnesses associated with HIV. CRIXIVAN can also help lower the amount of HIV in your body (called “viral load?) and raise your CD4 (T) cell count. CRIXIVAN may not have these effects in all patients.</p>
<p>CRIXIVAN is usually prescribed with other anti-HIV drugs such as ZDV (also called AZT), 3TC, ddI, ddC, or d4T. CRIXIVAN works differently from these other anti-HIV drugs. Talk with your doctor about how you should take CRIXIVAN.</p>

<h2><span class="Underline"><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">How should I take CRIXIVAN?</span></span></span></h2>
<p class="First">There are six important things you must do to help you benefit from CRIXIVAN:<br><br></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Take CRIXIVAN capsules every day as prescribed by your doctor. </span></span>Continue taking CRIXIVAN unless your doctor tells you to stop. Take the exact amount of CRIXIVAN that your doctor tells you to take, right from the very start. To help make sure you will benefit from CRIXIVAN, you must not skip doses or take “drug holidays?. If you don’t take CRIXIVAN as prescribed, the activity of CRIXIVAN may be reduced (due to resistance).<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Take CRIXIVAN capsules every 8 hours around the clock, <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">every day</span></span></span>.</span></span> It may be easier to remember to take CRIXIVAN if you take it at the same time every day. If you have questions about when to take CRIXIVAN, your doctor or health care provider can help you decide what schedule works for you.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">If you miss a dose by more than 2 hours, wait and then take the next dose at the regularly scheduled time. </span></span>However, if you miss a dose by less than 2 hours, take your missed dose immediately. Then take your next dose at the regularly scheduled time. Do not take more or less than your prescribed dose of CRIXIVAN at any one time.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Take CRIXIVAN with water. </span></span>You can also take CRIXIVAN with other beverages such as <span class="Underline">skim</span> or <span class="Underline">non-fat</span> milk, juice, coffee, or tea.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Ideally, take each dose of CRIXIVAN without food but with water at least one hour before or two hours after a meal. </span></span>Or you can take CRIXIVAN with a <span class="Underline">light</span> meal. Examples of light meals include:<br>       dry toast with jelly, juice, and coffee (with <span class="Underline">skim</span> or <span class="Underline">non-fat</span> milk and sugar if you want)<br>       cornflakes with <span class="Underline">skim</span> or <span class="Underline">non-fat</span> milk and sugar<br>Do not take CRIXIVAN at the same time as any meals that are high in calories, fat, and protein (for example — a bacon and egg breakfast). When taken at the same time as CRIXIVAN, these foods can interfere with CRIXIVAN being absorbed into your bloodstream and may lessen its effect.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">It is critical to drink plenty of fluids while taking CRIXIVAN. </span></span>Adults should drink at least six 8-ounce glasses of liquids (preferably water) throughout the day, every day. Your health care provider will give you further instructions on the amount of fluid that you should drink. <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">CRIXIVAN can cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201620" conceptname="Kidney stone">kidney stones</span>. </span></span>Having enough fluids in your body should help reduce the chances of forming a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201620" conceptname="Kidney stone">kidney stone</span>. Call your doctor or other health care provider if you develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4167250" conceptname="Renal pain">kidney pains</span> (middle to lower stomach or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134736" conceptname="Backache">back pain</span>) or blood in the urine.</li>

<h2><span class="Underline"><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Does CRIXIVAN cure HIV or AIDS?</span></span></span></h2>
