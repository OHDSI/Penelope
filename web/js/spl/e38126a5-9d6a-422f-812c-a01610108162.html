<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated 
levels of total <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> (Total-C), low density lipoprotein <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> 
(LDL-C), triglycerides (TG) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4122128" conceptname="Apolipoprotein">apolipoprotein</span> B (a membrane transport complex 
for LDL-C) promote human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103842" conceptname="Arteriosclerosis">atherosclerosis</span>. Similarly, decreased levels of 
HDL-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> (HDL-C) and its transport complex, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4122128" conceptname="Apolipoprotein">apolipoprotein</span> A, are 
associated with the development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103842" conceptname="Arteriosclerosis">atherosclerosis</span>. Epidemiologic investigations 
have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with 
the level of Total-C and LDL-C and inversely with the level of HDL-C. </p>
<p>      Like LDL, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>-enriched triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, 
including VLDL, IDL and remnants, can also promote <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103842" conceptname="Arteriosclerosis">atherosclerosis</span>. Elevated 
plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDL-C levels and 
small LDL particles, as well as in association with non-lipid metabolic risk 
factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not 
consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, 
the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.</p>
<p>      In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437827" conceptname="Pure hypercholesterolemia">hypercholesterolemia</span> and mixed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4159131" conceptname="Dyslipidemia">dyslipidemia</span>, treatment 
with Lescol<span class="Sup">®</span> (fluvastatin sodium) or Lescol<span class="Sup">®</span> XL (fluvastatin sodium) reduced Total-C, LDL-C, 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4122128" conceptname="Apolipoprotein">apolipoprotein</span> B, and triglycerides while producing an increase in HDL-C. 
Increases in HDL-C are greater in patients with low HDL-C (&lt;35 mg/dL). 
Neither agent had a consistent effect on either Lp(a) or fibrinogen. The effect 
of Lescol or Lescol XL induced changes in lipoprotein levels, including 
reduction of serum <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>, on cardiovascular mortality has not been 
determined.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span><p>Lescol is a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, which is 
responsible for the conversion of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A 
(HMG-CoA) to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>. The 
inhibition of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> biosynthesis reduces the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> in hepatic cells, 
which stimulates the synthesis of LDL receptors and thereby increases the uptake 
of LDL particles. The end result of these biochemical processes is a reduction 
of the plasma <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> concentration.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics/Metabolism</span><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span>Oral Absorption </span><p>Fluvastatin is absorbed rapidly and completely following oral 
administration of the capsule, with peak concentrations reached in less than 1 
hour. Following administration of a 10 mg dose, the absolute bioavailability is 
24% (range 9%-50%). Administration with food reduces the rate but not the extent 
of absorption. At steady state, administration of fluvastatin with the evening 
meal results in a two-fold decrease in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and more than 
two-fold increase in t<span class="Sub">max</span> as compared to administration 4 
hours after the evening meal. No significant differences in extent of absorption 
or in the lipid-lowering effects were observed between the two administrations. 
After single or multiple doses above 20 mg, fluvastatin exhibits saturable 
first-pass metabolism resulting in higher than expected plasma fluvastatin 
concentrations. </p>
<p>      Fluvastatin has two optical enantiomers, an active 3R,5S and an 
inactive 3S,5R form. In vivo studies showed that stereo-selective hepatic 
binding of the active form occurs during the first pass resulting in a 
difference in the peak levels of the two enantiomers, with the active to 
inactive peak concentration ratio being about 0.7. The approximate ratio of the 
active to inactive approaches unity after the peak is seen and thereafter the 
two enantiomers decline with the same half-life. After an intravenous 
administration, bypassing the first-pass, metabolism, the ratios of the 
enantiomers in plasma were similar throughout the concentration-time 
profiles.</p>
<p>      Fluvastatin administered as Lescol XL 80 mg tablets reaches peak 
concentration in approximately 3 hours under fasting conditions, after a low-fat 
meal, or 2.5 hours after a low-fat meal. The mean relative bioavailability of 
the XL tablet is approximately 29% (range: 9%-66%) compared to that of the 
Lescol immediate-release capsule administered under fasting conditions. 
Administration of a high-fat meal delayed the absorption (T<span class="Sub">max</span>: 6H) and increased the bioavailability of the XL tablet by 
approximately 50%. Once Lescol XL begins to be absorbed, fluvastatin 
concentrations rise rapidly. The maximum concentration seen after a high-fat 
meal is much less than the peak concentration following a single dose or 
twice daily dose of the 40 mg Lescol capsule. Overall variability in the 
pharmacokinetics of Lescol XL is large (42%-64% CV for C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC), and especially so after a high-fat meal (63%-89% 
for C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC). Intrasubject variability in the 
pharmacokinetics of Lescol XL under fasting conditions (about 25% for C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC) tends to be much smaller as compared to the 
overall variability. Multiple peaks in plasma fluvastatin concentrations have 
been observed after Lescol XL administration.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span>Distribution </span><p>Fluvastatin is 98% bound to plasma proteins. The mean volume of 
distribution (VD<span class="Sub">ss</span>) is estimated at 0.35 L/kg. The parent 
drug is targeted to the liver and no active metabolites are present 
systemically. At therapeutic concentrations, the protein binding of fluvastatin 
is not affected by warfarin, salicylic acid and glyburide.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span>Metabolism</span><p>Fluvastatin is metabolized in the liver, primarily via 
hydroxylation of the indole ring at the 5- and 6-positions. N-dealkylation and 
beta-oxidation of the side-chain also occurs. The hydroxy metabolites have some 
pharmacologic activity, but do not circulate in the blood. Both enantiomers of 
fluvastatin are metabolized in a similar manner.</p>
<p>      In vitro studies demonstrated that fluvastatin undergoes oxidative 
metabolism, predominantly via 2C9 isozyme systems (75%). Other isozymes that 
contribute to fluvastatin metabolism are 2C8 (~5%) and 3A4 (~20<span class="Italics">%). </span>(See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions Section).</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span>Elimination</span><p>Fluvastatin is primarily (about 90%) eliminated in the feces as 
metabolites, with less than 2% present as unchanged drug. Urinary recovery is 
about 5%. After a radiolabeled dose of fluvastatin, the clearance was 0.8 
L/h/kg. Following multiple oral doses of radiolabeled compound, there was no 
accumulation of fluvastatin; however, there was a 2.3- fold accumulation of 
total radioactivity.</p>
<p>      Steady-state plasma concentrations show no evidence of accumulation of 
fluvastatin following immediate release capsule administration of up to 80 mg 
daily, as evidenced by a beta-elimination half-life of less than 3 hours. 
However, under conditions of maximum rate of absorption (i.e., fasting) systemic 
exposure to fluvastatin is increased 33% to 53% compared to a single 20 mg or 
40 mg dose of the immediate- release capsule. Following once daily 
administration of the 80 mg Lescol XL tablet for 7 days, systemic exposure to 
fluvastatin is increased (20%-30%) compared to a single dose of the 80 mg Lescol 
XL tablet. Terminal half-life of Lescol XL was about 9 hours as a result of the 
slow-release formulation. </p>
<p>      Single-dose and steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters in 33 subjects 
with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437827" conceptname="Pure hypercholesterolemia">hypercholesterolemia</span> for the capsules and in 35 healthy subjects for the 
extended-release tablets are summarized below: </p>

patients, 10 to 16 years of age, who had an LDL-C &gt; 190 mg/dL or LDL-C &gt; 
160 mg/dL and one or more risk factors for coronary heart disease, or LDL-C &gt; 
160 mg/dL and a proven LDL-receptor defect. The mean baseline LDL-C was 225

<p>      In the first study, Lescol 20 mg to 80 mg daily doses decreased plasma 
levels of Total-C and LDL-C by 21% and 27%, respectively. The mean achieved 
LDL-C was 161 mg/dL (range: 74-336 mg/dL). In the second study, Lescol 20 mg to

dietary/lifestyle counseling and either Lescol 40 mg (n=844) or placebo (n=833) 
given twice daily for a median of 3.9 years. The study population was 84% male,

group and 171 in the placebo group). Consistent trends in risk reduction were 
observed in patients &gt;65 years of age.</p>

In this randomized double-blind, placebo- controlled trial, 429 patients were 
treated with conventional measures (Step 1 AHA Diet) and either Lescol 40 mg/day 
or placebo. In order to provide treatment to patients receiving placebo with 
LDL-C levels <span class="Underline">&gt;</span>160 mg/dL at baseline, adjunctive therapy with cholestyramine was 
added after Week 12 to all patients in the study with baseline LDL-C values of <span class="Underline">&gt;</span>160 mg/dL. These baseline levels were present in 25% of the study population. 
Quantitative coronary angiograms were evaluated at baseline and 2.5 years in 340

<p>      Lescol significantly slowed the progression of coronary

progression of lesions as measured by within-patient per-lesion change in 
minimum lumen diameter (MLD), the primary endpoint (see Figure 3 below), percent 
diameter stenosis (Figure 4), and the formation of new lesions (13% of all 
fluvastatin patients versus 22% of all placebo patients). Additionally, a 
significant difference in favor of Lescol was found between all fluvastatin and 
all placebo patients in the distribution among the three categories of definite 
progression, definite regression, and mixed or no change. Beneficial 
angiographic results (change in MLD) were independent of patients’ gender and 
consistent across a range of baseline LDL-C levels.</p>

fluvastatin sodium, a lipid profile should be performed to measure Total-C, 
HDL-C and TG. For patients with TG &lt;400 mg/dL (&lt;4.5 mmol/L), LDL-C can be 
estimated using the following equation:</p>
<p>LDL-C = Total-C - HDL-C - 1/5 TG</p>
<p>      For TG levels &gt;400 mg/dL (&gt;4.5 mmol/L), this equation is less 
accurate and LDL-C concentrations should be determined by ultracentrifugation. 
In many hypertriglyceridemic patients LDL-C may be low or normal despite 
elevated Total-C. In such cases, Lescol is not indicated.</p>
<p>      Lipid determinations should be performed at intervals of no less than 4 
weeks and dosage adjusted according to the patient’s response to therapy.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<a href="http://"></a><span class="Bold">Liver Enzymes</span><p class="First">Biochemical abnormalities of liver function have been associated 
with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and other lipid-lowering agents. Approximately 
1.1% of patients treated with Lescol<span class="Sup">®</span> (fluvastatin 
sodium) capsules in worldwide trials developed dose-related, persistent 
elevations of transaminase levels to more than 3 times the upper limit of 
normal. Fourteen of these patients (0.6%) were discontinued from therapy. In all 
clinical trials, a total of 33/2969 patients (1.1%) had persistent transaminase 
elevations with an average fluvastatin exposure of approximately 71.2 weeks; 19 
of these patients (0.6%) were discontinued. The majority of patients with these 
abnormal biochemical findings were asymptomatic.</p>
<p>      In a pooled analysis of all placebo-controlled studies in which Lescol 
capsules were used, persistent transaminase elevations (&gt;3 times the upper 
limit of normal [ULN] on two consecutive weekly measurements) occurred in 0.2%, 
1.5%, and 2.7% of patients treated with 20, 40, and 80 mg (titrated to 40 mg 
twice daily) Lescol capsules, respectively. Ninety-one percent of the cases of 
persistent liver function test abnormalities (20 of 22 patients) occurred within 
12 weeks of therapy and in all patients with persistent liver function test 
abnormalities there was an abnormal liver function test present at baseline or 
by Week 8.</p>
<p>      In the pooled analysis of the 24-week controlled trials, persistent 
transaminase elevation occurred in 1.9%, 1.8% and 4.9% of patients treated with 
Lescol<span class="Sup">®</span> XL (fluvastatin sodium) 80 mg, Lescol 40 mg and 
Lescol 40 mg twice daily, respectively. In 13 of 16 patients treated with Lescol 
XL the abnormality occurred within 12 weeks of initiation of treatment with 
Lescol XL 80 mg.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">      It is recommended that liver function tests be 
performed before the initiation of therapy and at 12 weeks following initiation 
of treatment or elevation in dose.</span> Patients who develop transaminase 
elevations or signs and symptoms of liver disease should be monitored to confirm 
the finding and should be followed thereafter with frequent liver function tests 
until the levels return to normal. Should an increase in AST or ALT of three 
times the upper limit of normal or greater persist (found on two consecutive 
occasions) withdrawal of fluvastatin sodium therapy is recommended.</p>
<p>      Active liver disease or unexplained transaminase elevations are 
contraindications to the use of Lescol and Lescol XL (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). 
Caution should be exercised when fluvastatin sodium is administered to patients 
with a history of liver disease or heavy alcohol ingestion (see CLINICAL

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span><p>The below listed drug interaction information is derived from

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span>Immunosuppressive Drugs, 
Gemfibrozil, Niacin (Nicotinic Acid), Erythromycin </span><p>(See WARNINGS: Skeletal Muscle).</p>
<p>      In vitro data indicate that fluvastatin metabolism involves multiple 
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes. CYP2C9 isoenzyme is primarily involved in the 
metabolism of fluvastatin (~75%), while CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes are 
involved to a much less extent, i.e., ~5% and ~20%, respectively. If one pathway 
is inhibited in the elimination process of fluvastatin other pathways may 
compensate.</p>
<p>      In vivo drug interaction studies with CYP3A4 inhibitors/substrates such 
as cyclosporine, erythromycin, and itraconazole result in minimal changes in the 
pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin, confirming less involvement of CYP3A4 isozyme. 
Concomitant administration of fluvastatin and phenytoin increased the levels of 
phenytoin and fluvastatin, suggesting predominant involvement of CYP2C9 in 
fluvastatin metabolism.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span>Niacin/Propranolol:</span><p>Concomitant administration of immediate- release fluvastatin

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span>Cholestyramine:</span><p>Administration of immediate- release fluvastatin sodium 
concomitantly with, or up to 4 hours after cholestyramine, results in 
fluvastatin decreases of more than 50% for AUC and 50%-80% for C<span class="Sub">max</span>. However, administration of immediate- release fluvastatin 
sodium 4 hours after cholestyramine resulted in a clinically significant 
additive effect compared with that achieved with either component drug. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span>Cyclosporine:</span><p>Plasma cyclosporine levels remain unchanged when fluvastatin (20 
mg daily) was administered concurrently in renal transplant recipients on stable 
cyclosporine regimens. Fluvastatin AUC increased 1.9- fold, and C<span class="Sub">max</span> increased 1.3- fold compared to historical controls.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span>Digoxin:</span><p>In a crossover study involving 18 patients chronically receiving 
digoxin, a single 40 mg dose of immediate- release fluvastatin had no effect on 
digoxin AUC, but had an 11% increase in digoxin C<span class="Sub">max</span> and 
small increase in digoxin urinary clearance.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span>Erythromycin:</span><p>Erythromycin (500 mg, single dose) did not affect steady-state

approximately 50%, 69% and 121%, respectively. Glibenclamide (5-20 mg daily) 
increased the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of fluvastatin by 44% and 
51%, respectively. In this study there were no changes in glucose, insulin and 
C-peptide levels. However, patients on concomitant therapy with glibenclamide 
(glyburide) and fluvastatin should continue to be monitored appropriately when 
their fluvastatin dose is increased to 40 mg twice daily.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span>Losartan:</span><p>Concomitant administration of fluvastatin with losartan has no 
effect on the bioavailability of either losartan or its active metabolite.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span>Cimetidine/Ranitidine/Omeprazole:</span><p>Concomitant administration of immediate- release fluvastatin

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span>Warfarin:</span><p>In vitro protein binding studies demonstrated no interaction at 
therapeutic concentrations. Concomitant administration of a single dose of 
warfarin (30 mg) in young healthy males receiving immediate- release fluvastatin 
sodium (40 mg/day x 8 days) resulted in no elevation of racemic warfarin 
concentration. There was also no effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> complex activity when 
compared to concomitant administration of placebo and warfarin. However,

inhibitors. Therefore, patients receiving warfarin-type anticoagulants should 
have their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> times closely monitored when fluvastatin sodium is

adrenal or gonadal steroid hormone production.</p>
<p>      Fluvastatin exhibited no effect upon non-stimulated cortisol levels and 
demonstrated no effect upon thyroid metabolism as assessed by TSH. Small 
declines in total testosterone have been noted in treated groups, but no 
commensurate elevation in LH occurred, suggesting that the observation was not 
due to a direct effect upon testosterone production. No effect upon FSH in males 
was noted. Due to the limited number of premenopausal females studied to date, 
no conclusions regarding the effect of fluvastatin upon female sex hormones may 
be made. </p>
<p>      Two clinical studies in patients receiving fluvastatin at doses up to 
80 mg daily for periods of 24 to 28 weeks demonstrated no effect of treatment 
upon the adrenal response to ACTH stimulation. A clinical study evaluated the 
effect of fluvastatin at doses up to 80 mg daily for 28 weeks upon the gonadal 
response to HCG stimulation. Although the mean total testosterone response was 
significantly reduced (p&lt;0.05) relative to baseline in the 80 mg group, it 
was not significant in comparison to the changes noted in groups receiving 
either 40 mg of fluvastatin or placebo. </p>
<p>      Patients treated with fluvastatin sodium who develop clinical evidence 
of endocrine dysfunction should be evaluated appropriately. Caution should be 
exercised if an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor or other agent used to lower 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> levels is administered to patients receiving other drugs (e.g.,

fluvastatin sodium appears to be consistent with findings from other HMG-CoA 
reductase inhibitors. In contrast to other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, no 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4301500" conceptname="Liver cell adenoma">hepatic adenomas</span> or carcinomas were observed.</p>
<p>      The carcinogenicity study conducted in mice at dose levels of 0.3, 15 
and 30 mg/kg/day revealed, as in rats, a statistically significant increase in 
forestomach squamous cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4034142" conceptname="Papilloma">papillomas</span> in males and females at 30 mg/kg/day and in 
females at 15 mg/kg/day. These treatment levels represented plasma drug levels 
of approximately 0.05, 2, and 7 times the mean human plasma drug concentration 
after a 40 mg oral dose.</p>
<p>      No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in vitro, with or without 
rat-liver metabolic activation, in the following studies: microbial mutagen 
tests using mutant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of <span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span> typhimurium</span>

in BALB/3T3 cells; unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat primary hepatocytes; 
chromosomal aberrations in V79 Chinese Hamster cells; HGPRT V79 Chinese Hamster 
cells. In addition, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in vivo in either a 
rat or mouse micronucleus test.</p>
<p>      In a study in rats at dose levels for females of 0.6, 2 and 6 mg/kg/day 
and at dose levels for males of 2, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day, fluvastatin sodium had 
no adverse effects on the fertility or reproductive performance. </p>
<p>      Seminal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443720" conceptname="Blister">vesicles</span> and testes were small in hamsters treated for 3 months 
at 20 mg/kg/day (approximately three times the 40 milligram human daily dose 
based on surface area, mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). There was tubular 
degeneration and aspermatogenesis in testes as well as vesiculitis of seminal

<p>Fluvastatin sodium produced delays in skeletal development in rats at doses 
of 12 mg/kg/day and in rabbits at doses of 10 mg/kg/day. Malaligned thoracic 
vertebrae were seen in rats at 36 mg/kg, a dose that produced maternal toxicity. 
These doses resulted in 2 times (rat at 12 mg/kg) or 5 times (rabbit at 10 
mg/kg) the 40 mg human exposure based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> surface 
area. A study in which female rats were dosed during the third trimester at 12 
and 24 mg/kg/day resulted in maternal mortality at or near term and postpartum. 
In addition, fetal and neonatal lethality were apparent. No effects on the dam 
or fetus occurred at 2 mg/kg/day. A second study at levels of 2, 6, 12 and 24 
mg/kg/day confirmed the findings in the first study with neonatal mortality 
beginning at 6 mg/kg. A modified Segment III study was performed at dose levels 
of 12 or 24 mg/kg/day with or without the presence of concurrent supplementation 
with mevalonic acid, a product of HMG-CoA reductase which is essential for 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> biosynthesis. The concurrent administration of mevalonic acid 
completely prevented the maternal and neonatal mortality but did not prevent low 
body weights in pups at 24 mg/kg on Days 0 and 7 postpartum. Therefore, the 
maternal and neonatal lethality observed with fluvastatin sodium reflect its 
exaggerated pharmacologic effect during pregnancy. There are no data with 
fluvastatin sodium in pregnant women. However, rare reports of congenital 
anomalies have been received following intrauterine exposure to other HMG-CoA 
reductase inhibitors. There has been one report of severe congenital bony

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">In all clinical studies of Lescol<span class="Sup">®</span> 
(fluvastatin sodium), 1.0% (32/2969) of fluvastatin-treated patients were 
discontinued due to adverse experiences attributed to study drug (mean exposure 
approximately 16 months ranging in duration from 1 to &gt;36 months). This 
results in an exposure adjusted rate of 0.8% (32/4051) per patient year in 
fluvastatin patients in controlled studies compared to an incidence of 1.1% 
(4/355) in placebo patients. Adverse reactions have usually been of mild to 
moderate severity. </p>
<p>      In controlled clinical studies, 3.9% (36/912) of patients treated with 
Lescol<span class="Sup">®</span> XL (fluvastatin sodium) 80 mg discontinued due to 
adverse events (causality not determined).</p>

<p>      There has been a single report of 2 children, one 2 years old and the 
other 3 years of age, either of whom may have possibly ingested fluvastatin 
sodium. The maximum amount of fluvastatin sodium that could have been ingested 
was 80 mg (4 x 20 mg capsules). <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">Vomiting</span> was induced by ipecac in both children 
and no capsules were noted in their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span>. Neither child experienced any 
adverse symptoms and both recovered from the incident without problems.</p>
<p>      Should an accidental <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> occur, treat symptomatically and 
institute supportive measures as required. The dialyzability of fluvastatin 
sodium and of its metabolites in humans is not known at present.</p>
<p>      Information about the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> can often be obtained from 
a certified Regional Poison Control Center. Telephone numbers of certified 
Regional Poison Control Centers are listed in the Physicians’ Desk

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">The patient should be placed on a standard <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>-lowering 
diet before receiving Lescol<span class="Sup">®</span> (fluvastatin sodium) or 
Lescol<span class="Sup">®</span> XL (fluvastatin sodium) and should continue on 
this diet during treatment with Lescol or Lescol XL. (See NCEP Treatment 
Guidelines for details on dietary therapy.)</p>
<p>      For patients requiring LDL-C reduction to a goal of ≥25%, the 
recommended starting dose is 40 mg as one capsule in the evening, 80 mg as one 
Lescol XL tablet administered as a single dose at any time of the day or 80 mg 
in divided doses of the 40 mg capsule given twice daily. For patients requiring 
LDL-C reduction to a goal of &lt;25% a starting dose of 20 mg may be used. The 
recommended dosing range is 20-80 mg/day. Lescol or Lescol XL may be taken 
without regard to meals, since there are no apparent differences in the 
lipid-lowering effects of fluvastatin sodium administered with the evening meal 
or 4 hours after the evening meal.  Do not break, crush or chew Lescol XL 
tablets or open Lescol capsules prior to administration.</p>
<p>      Since the maximal reductions in LDL-C of a given dose are seen within 4 
weeks, periodic lipid determinations should be performed and dosage adjustment 
made according to the patient’s response to therapy and established treatment 
guidelines. The therapeutic effect of Lescol or Lescol XL is maintained with 
prolonged administration.</p>

<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437827" conceptname="Pure hypercholesterolemia">Hypercholesterolemia</span> in Pediatric Patients</span><p>The recommended starting dose is one 20 mg Lescol capsule. Dose 
adjustments, up to a maximum daily dose administered either as Lescol capsules 
40 mg twice daily or one Lescol XL 80 mg tablet once daily, should be made at 
6 week intervals. Doses should be individualized according to the goal of 
therapy (see NCEP Pediatric Panel Guidelines and INDICATIONS AND USAGE.)<span class="Sup">1</span>.</p>

are additive when immediate release Lescol is combined with a bile-acid binding 
resin or niacin. When administering a bile-acid resin (e.g., cholestyramine) and 
fluvastatin sodium, Lescol should be administered at bedtime, at least 2 hours 
following the resin to avoid a significant interaction due to drug binding to 
resin. (See also ADVERSE REACTIONS: Concomitant Therapy.)</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Bold">Dosage in Patients with Renal 
Insufficiency</span><p>Since fluvastatin sodium is cleared hepatically with less than 6% 
of the administered dose excreted into the urine, dose adjustments for mild to 
moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> are not necessary. Fluvastatin has not been studied at 
doses greater than 40 mg in patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>; therefore 
caution should be exercised when treating such patients at higher doses.</p>

<p>Read the Patient Information that comes with LESCOL or LESCOL XL before you 
start taking it, and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. 
This leaflet does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your 
condition or treatment. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about LESCOL or LESCOL XL, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">What are LESCOL and LESCOL XL?</span></p>
<p>LESCOL and LESCOL XL are prescription medicines called "statins" that lower 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> in your blood. They lower the "bad" <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> and triglycerides in 
your blood. They can raise your "good" <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> as well. </p>
<p>LESCOL and LESCOL XL are for people whose <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> does not come down 
enough with exercise and a low-fat diet alone.</p>
<p> LESCOL and LESCOL XL may be used in patients with heart disease (coronary 
artery disease) to:</p>
<ul>
<li>lower the chances of heart problems which would require procedures to help 
restore blood flow to the heart.<br>
</li>
<li>slow the buildup of too much <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> in the arteries of the 
heart.</li>
</ul>
<p>Treatment with LESCOL or LESCOL XL has not been shown to prevent heart 
attacks or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>.</p>
<p>LESCOL and LESCOL XL have the same active ingredient, fluvastatin. However, 
LESCOL is a capsule that is taken one or two times a day and LESCOL XL is an 
extended-release tablet that is only taken one time a day.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Who should not take LESCOL or LESCOL XL?</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Do not take LESCOL or LESCOL XL if you:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="Bold">are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, or are planning
