<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First"><a name="INV-46ca510a-e673-4275-a516-08d41c9b2aee"></a>The barbiturates are nonselective central nervous system (CNS) depressants that are primarily used as sedative hypnotics. In subhypnotic doses, they are also used as anticonvulsants. The barbiturates and their sodium salts are subject to control under the Federal Controlled Substances Act.</p>
<p><a name="INV-eb49bfba-aa45-48df-9853-ec62fbe96757"></a>Seconal Sodium<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (Secobarbital Sodium Capsules, USP) is a barbituric acid derivative and occurs as a white, odorless, bitter powder that is very soluble in water, soluble in alcohol, and practically insoluble in ether. Chemically, the drug is sodium 5-allyl-5-(1-methylbutyl) barbiturate, with the molecular formula C<span class="Sub">12</span>H<span class="Sub">17</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>NaO<span class="Sub">3</span>. Its molecular weight is 260.27. The structural formula is as follows:</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"><a name="INV-ff56b898-9867-4432-ba33-839f44006948"></a>Barbiturates are capable of producing all levels of CNS mood alteration, from excitation to mild sedation, hypnosis, and deep <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>. Overdosage can produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. In high enough therapeutic doses, barbiturates induce anesthesia. Barbiturates depress the sensory cortex, decrease motor activity, alter cerebellar function, and produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, sedation, and hypnosis.</p>
<p><a name="INV-a2642284-5518-4787-8443-ca026364d61b"></a>Barbiturate-induced sleep differs from physiologic sleep. Sleep laboratory studies have demonstrated that barbiturates reduce the amount of time spent in the rapid eye movement (REM) phase, or dreaming stage of sleep. Also, Stages III and IV sleep are decreased. Following abrupt cessation of regularly used barbiturates, patients may experience markedly increased dreaming, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4009184" conceptname="Dream anxiety disorder">nightmares</span>, and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>. Therefore, withdrawal of a single therapeutic dose over 5 or 6 days has been recommended to lessen the REM rebound and disturbed sleep that contribute to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441260" conceptname="Drug withdrawal">drug withdrawal syndrome</span> (for example, decreasing the dose from 3 to 2 doses a day for 1 week).</p>
<p><a name="INV-21e2f87b-0c22-4277-ad34-7b3c3a02c98d"></a>In studies, secobarbital sodium and pentobarbital sodium have been found to lose most of their effectiveness for both inducing and maintaining sleep by the end of 2 weeks of continued drug administration, even with the use of multiple doses. As with secobarbital sodium and pentobarbital sodium, other barbiturates (including amobarbital) might be expected to lose their effectiveness for inducing and maintaining sleep after about 2 weeks. The short-, intermediate-, and to a lesser degree, long-acting barbiturates have been widely prescribed for treating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>. Although the clinical literature abounds with claims that the shortacting barbiturates are superior for producing sleep whereas the intermediate-acting compounds are more effective in maintaining sleep, controlled studies have failed to demonstrate these differential effects. Therefore, as sleep medications, the barbiturates are of limited value beyond short-term use.</p>
<p><a name="INV-1d9deef4-ea5c-4d63-ae1c-5763e3b6a8ad"></a>Barbiturates have little analgesic action at subanesthetic doses. Rather, in subanesthetic doses, these drugs may increase the reaction to painful stimuli. All barbiturates exhibit anticonvulsant activity in anesthetic doses. However, of the drugs in this class, only phenobarbital, mephobarbital, and metharbital are effective as oral anticonvulsants in subhypnotic doses.</p>
<p><a name="INV-1915e5f8-7068-43f3-a512-a189b4b53b1e"></a>Barbiturates are respiratory depressants, and the degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> is dependent on the dose. With hypnotic doses, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> is similar to that which occurs during physiologic sleep accompanied by a slight decrease in blood pressure and heart rate.</p>
<p><a name="INV-a624dce0-862e-4cb7-a209-ff7a93c9607f"></a>Studies in laboratory animals have shown that barbiturates cause reduction in the tone and contractility of the uterus, ureters, and urinary bladder. However, concentrations of the drugs required to produce this effect in humans are not reached with sedative-hypnotic doses.</p>
<p><a name="INV-38ef30f5-0625-41fe-a5eb-6ceb04ccae02"></a>Barbiturates do not impair normal hepatic function, but have been shown to induce liver microsomal enzymes, thus increasing and/or altering the metabolism of barbiturates and other drugs (see Drug Interactions <span class="Italics">under</span> Precautions).</p>

<h2><span class="Italics">Pharmacokinetics</span></h2>
<p class="First"><a name="INV-67cf1d3a-af55-46e7-bb51-1e15421dac3f"></a>Barbiturates are absorbed in varying degrees following oral or parenteral administration. The salts are more rapidly absorbed than are the acids. The rate of absorption is increased if the sodium salt is ingested as a dilute solution or taken on an empty stomach.</p>
<p><a name="INV-4252bccf-319e-4c08-b349-02b9e626aeb4"></a>Duration of action, which is related to the rate at which the barbiturates are redistributed throughout the body, varies among persons and in the same person from time to time.</p>
<p><a name="INV-a9c56761-b682-48fd-8fc1-ee592b19c6e8"></a>Seconal Sodium is classified as a short-acting barbiturate when taken orally. Its onset of action is 10 to 15 minutes and its duration of action ranges from 3 to 4 hours.</p>
<p><a name="INV-82ad4c16-726e-4f5f-a573-1e52e89999ed"></a>Barbiturates are weak acids that are absorbed and rapidly distributed to all tissues and fluids, with high concentrations in the brain, liver, and kidneys. Lipid solubility of the barbiturates is the dominant factor in their distribution within the body. The more lipid soluble the barbiturate, the more rapidly it penetrates all tissues of the body. Barbiturates are bound to plasma and tissue proteins to a varying degree, with the degree of binding increasing directly as a function of lipid solubility.</p>
<p><a name="INV-376c1f40-2e0a-4aae-b123-47abf5a72a5d"></a>Phenobarbital has the lowest lipid solubility, lowest plasma binding, lowest brain protein binding, the longest delay in onset of activity, and the longest duration of action. At the opposite extreme is secobarbital, which has the highest lipid solubility, highest plasma protein binding, highest brain protein binding, the shortest delay in onset of activity, and the shortest duration of action. The plasma half-life for secobarbital sodium in adults ranges between 15 to 40 hours, with a mean of 28 hours. No data are available for pediatric patients and newborns.</p>
<p><a name="INV-a16b9c89-a804-4946-bd73-ee245c0681a8"></a>Barbiturates are metabolized primarily by the hepatic microsomal enzyme system, and the metabolic products are excreted in the urine and, less commonly, in the feces. The excretion of unmetabolized barbiturate is 1 feature that distinguishes the long-acting category from those belonging to other categories, which are almost entirely metabolized. The inactive metabolites of the barbiturates are excreted as conjugates of glucuronic acid.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First"><a name="INV-8d04d873-bbea-4339-a436-c49fbf3a02e6"></a>Because <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435524" conceptname="Sleep disorder">sleep disturbances</span> may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and/or psychiatric disorder, symptomatic treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> should be initiated only after a careful evaluation of the patient. <span class="Bold">The failure of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated.</span> Worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> or the emergence of new thinking or behavior abnormalities may be the consequence of an unrecognized psychiatric or physical disorder. Such findings have emerged during the course of treatment with sedative-hypnotic drugs. Because some of the important adverse effects of sedative-hypnotics appear to be dose related (see Precautions and Dosage and Administration), it is important to use the smallest possible effective dose, especially in the elderly.      </p>
<p><a name="INV-9e92088c-7f2e-4f9f-a0df-62510ca0e4f1"></a>Complex behaviors such as â€œsleep-drivingâ€? (i.e., driving while not fully awake after ingestion of a sedative-hypnotic, with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439147" conceptname="Amnesia">amnesia</span> for the event) have been reported. These events can occur in sedative-hypnotic-naÃ¯ve as well as in sedative-hypnotic-experienced persons. Although behaviors such as sleep-driving may occur with sedative-hypnotics alone at therapeutic doses, the use of alcohol and other CNS depressants with sedative-hypnotics appears to increase the risk of such behaviors, as does the use of sedative-hypnotics at doses exceeding the maximum recommended dose. Due to the risk to the patient and the community, discontinuation of sedative-hypnotics should be strongly considered for patients who report a â€œsleep-drivingâ€? episode.    </p>
<p><a name="INV-b4340dc1-2da2-4ae2-97f6-5d74e7dead73"></a>Other complex behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have been reported in patients who are not fully awake after taking a sedative-hypnotic. As with sleep-driving, patients usually do not remember these events.</p>

Patients who have psychological <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">dependence on barbiturates</span> may increase the dosage or decrease the dosage interval without consulting a physician and subsequently may develop a physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">dependence on barbiturates</span>. To minimize the possibility of overdosage or development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>, the prescribing and dispensing of sedative-hypnotic barbiturates should be limited to the amount required for the interval until the next appointment. The abrupt cessation after prolonged use in a person who is dependent on the drug may result in withdrawal symptoms, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373995" conceptname="Delirium">delirium</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>, and possibly <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.

<p><a name="INV-be7f0bad-b636-4ada-84de-b54bcdcbeade"></a>3. <span class="Italics">Usage in Pregnancy</span>â€”Barbiturates can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Retrospective, case-controlled studies have suggested that there may be a connection between the maternal consumption of barbiturates and a higher than expected incidence of fetal abnormalities. Barbiturates readily cross the placental barrier and are distributed throughout fetal tissues; the highest concentrations are found in the placenta, fetal liver, and brain. Fetal blood levels approach maternal blood levels following parenteral administration.</p>
<p><a name="INV-fe962056-3726-433a-817c-44fa2cfb9f22"></a>Withdrawal symptoms occur in infants born to women who receive barbiturates throughout the last trimester of pregnancy (see Drug Abuse and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">Dependence</span>). If Seconal Sodium is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.</p>

<p><a name="INV-6fa77010-4d10-4419-ba49-7105ada61c96"></a>There have been reports of people getting out of bed after taking a sedative-hypnotic and driving their cars while not fully awake, often with no memory of the event. If a patient experiences such an episode, it should be reported to his or her doctor immediately, since â€œsleep-drivingâ€? can be dangerous. This behavior is more likely to occur when sedative-hypnotics are taken with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants (see WARNINGS).

<p><a name="INV-06d660f2-3834-4f7c-ad9e-c739d6a5059b"></a>1. The use of Seconal Sodium carries with it an associated risk of psychological and/or physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>.

<h2><span class="Italics">Drug Interactions</span></h2>
<p class="First"><a name="INV-a27ad4c6-de84-41bd-82e4-47ca1092485b"></a>Most reports of clinically significant drug interactions occurring with the barbiturates have involved phenobarbital. However, the application of these data to other barbiturates appears valid and warrants serial blood level determinations of the relevant drugs when there are multiple therapies.</p>
<p><a name="INV-bd180ebc-ebff-4f37-9d36-b092c62315d7"></a>1. <span class="Italics">Anticoagulants</span>â€”Phenobarbital lowers the plasma levels of dicumarol and causes a decrease in anticoagulant activity as measured by the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time. Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon). Patients stabilized on anticoagulant therapy may require dosage adjustments if barbiturates are added to or withdrawn from their dosage regimen.</p>
<p><a name="INV-b0cf48ba-0923-4a47-8728-721d7b8d04a7"></a>2. <span class="Italics">Corticosteroids</span>â€”Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids, probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes. Patients stabilized on corticosteroid therapy may require dosage adjustments if barbiturates are added to or withdrawn from their dosage regimen.</p>
<p><a name="INV-3ef83316-2ac1-4ced-93cb-851c11c25a7f"></a>3. <span class="Italics">Griseofulvin</span>â€”Phenobarbital appears to interfere with the absorption of orally administered griseofulvin, thus decreasing its blood level. The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established. However, it would be preferable to avoid concomitant administration of these drugs.</p>
<p><a name="INV-9ab2dec8-7482-4826-a001-2854160f3648"></a>4. <span class="Italics">Doxycycline</span>â€”Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued.</p>
<p><a name="INV-dd3af964-e96d-47f1-be36-a0325b63b3b2"></a>This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic. If barbiturates and doxycycline are administered concurrently, the clinical response to doxycycline should be monitored closely.</p>
<p><a name="INV-52430398-8347-434d-b938-79dd84379494"></a>5. <span class="Italics">Phenytoin, Sodium Valproate, Valproic Acid</span>â€”The effect of barbiturates on the metabolism of phenytoin appears to be variable. Some investigators report an accelerating effect, whereas  others report no effect. Because the effect of barbiturates on the metabolism of phenytoin is not predictable, phenytoin and barbiturate blood levels should be monitored more frequently if these drugs are given concurrently. Sodium valproate and valproic acid increase the secobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, secobarbital sodium blood levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.</p>

Barbiturate-dependent patients can be withdrawn by using a number of withdrawal regimens. In all cases, withdrawal takes an extended period. One method involves substituting a 30-mg dose of phenobarbital for each 100- to 200-mg dose of barbiturate that the patient has been taking. The total daily amount of phenobarbital is then administered in 3 or 4 divided doses, not to exceed 600 mg daily. Should signs of withdrawal occur on the first day of treatment, a loading dose of 100 to 200 mg of phenobarbital may be administered IM in addition to the oral dose. After stabilization on phenobarbital, the total daily dose is decreased by 30 mg a day as long as withdrawal is proceeding smoothly. A modification of this regimen involves initiating treatment at the patientâ€™s regular dosage level and decreasing the daily dosage by 10% as tolerated by the patient.</p>
