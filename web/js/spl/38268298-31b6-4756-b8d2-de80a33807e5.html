<h1><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span></h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="43679-0">
<a name="section-3.1"></a><p></p>
<h2><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></h2>
<p class="First">Benazepril and benazeprilat inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and in animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex.</p>
<p>Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. Hypertensive patients treated with benazepril alone for up to 52 weeks had elevations of serum potassium of up to 0.2 mEq/L. Similar patients treated with benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide for up to 24 weeks had no consistent changes in their serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS).</p>
<p>Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. In animal studies, benazepril had no inhibitory effect on the vasopressor response to angiotensin II and did not interfere with the hemodynamic effects of the autonomic neurotransmitters acetylcholine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine.</p>
<p>ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of Lotensin HCT remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>While the mechanism through which benazepril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, benazepril has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with low-renin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>.</p>
<p>Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin, so coadministration of an ACE inhibitor tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics. </p>
<p>The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown. </p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-3.2"></a><p></p>
<h2><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</span></h2>
<p class="First">Following oral administration of Lotensin HCT, peak plasma concentrations of benazepril are reached within 0.5-1.0 hours. As determined by urinary recovery, the extent of absorption is at least 37%. The absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is somewhat slower (1-2.5 hours) and somewhat more complete (50%-80%). In fasting subjects, the rate and extent of absorption of benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide from Lotensin HCT are not different, respectively, from the rate and extent of absorption of benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide from immediate-release monotherapy formulations.</p>
<p>The absorption of benazepril from Lotensin<span class="Sup">®</span> tablets is not influenced by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract, but possible effects of food upon absorption of either component from Lotensin HCT tablets have not been studied. The reported studies of food effects on hydrochlorothiazide absorption have been inconclusive. The absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is increased by agents that reduce gastrointestinal motility, but it is reported to be reduced by 50% in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>.</p>
<p>Cleavage of the ester group (primarily in the liver) converts benazepril to its active metabolite, benazeprilat. Peak plasma concentrations of benazeprilat are reached 1-2 hours after drug intake in the fasting state and 2-4 hours after drug intake in the nonfasting state. The serum protein binding of benazepril is about 96.7% and that of benazeprilat about 95.3%, as measured by equilibrium dialysis; on the basis of in vitro studies, the degree of protein binding should be unaffected by age, hepatic dysfunction, or – over the concentration range of 0.24-23.6 µmol/L – concentration.</p>
<p>Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized. Its apparent volume of distribution is 3.6-7.8 L/kg, and its measured plasma protein binding is 67.9%. The drug also accumulates in red blood cells, so that whole blood levels are 1.6-1.8 times those measured in plasma.</p>
<p>In studies of rats given <span class="Sup">14</span>C-benazepril, benazepril and its metabolites crossed the blood-brain barrier only to an extremely low extent. Multiple doses of benazepril did not result in accumulation in any tissue except the lung, where, as with other ACE inhibitors in similar studies, there was a slight increase in concentration due to slow elimination in that organ.</p>
<p>Some placental passage occurred when benazepril was administered to pregnant rats. In humans, hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta freely, and levels in umbilical-cord blood are similar to those in the maternal circulation.</p>
<p>Benazepril is almost completely metabolized to benazeprilat, which has much greater ACE inhibitory activity than benazepril, and to the glucuronide conjugates of benazepril and benazeprilat. Only trace amounts of an administered dose of benazepril can be recovered unchanged in the urine; about 20% of the dose is excreted as benazeprilat, 4% as benazepril glucuronide, and 8% as benazeprilat glucuronide.</p>
<p>In patients with hepatic dysfunction due to cirrhosis, levels of benazeprilat are essentially unaltered. Similarly, the pharmacokinetics of benazepril and benazeprilat do not appear to be influenced by age.</p>
<p>The kinetics of benazepril are dose-proportional within the dosage range of 5-20 mg. Small deviations from dose proportionality were observed when the broader range of 2-80 mg was studied, possibly due to the saturable binding of the compound to ACE. </p>
<p>The effective half-life of accumulation of benazeprilat following multiple dosing of benazepril hydrochloride is 10-11 hours. Thus, steady-state concentrations of benazeprilat should be reached after 2 or 3 doses of benazepril hydrochloride given once daily. </p>
<p>During chronic administration (28 days) of once-daily doses of benazepril between 5 mg and 20 mg, the kinetics did not change, and there was no significant accumulation. Accumulation ratios based on AUC and urinary recovery of benazeprilat were 1.19 and 1.27, respectively.</p>
<p>When dialysis was started 2 hours after ingestion of 10 mg of benazepril, approximately 6% of benazeprilat was removed in 4 hours of dialysis. The parent compound, benazepril, was not detected in the dialysate.</p>
<p>Benazepril and benazeprilat are cleared predominantly by renal excretion in healthy subjects with normal renal function. Nonrenal (i.e., biliary) excretion accounts for approximately 11%-12% of benazeprilat excretion in healthy subjects. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span>, biliary clearance may compensate to an extent for deficient renal clearance.</p>
<p>The disposition of benazepril and benazeprilat in patients with mild-to-moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> (creatinine clearance &gt;30 mL/min) is similar to that in patients with normal renal function. In patients with creatinine clearance ≤30 mL/min, peak benazeprilat levels and the initial (alpha phase) half-life increase, and time to steady state may be delayed (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>
<p>Thiazide diuretics are eliminated by the kidney, with a terminal half-life of 5-15 hours. In a study of patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> (mean creatinine clearance of 19 mL/min), the half-life of hydrochlorothiazide elimination was lengthened to 21 hours. </p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Pharmacodynamics</span></h2>
<p class="First">Single and multiple doses of 10 mg or more of <span class="Bold">benazepril</span> cause inhibition of plasma ACE activity by at least 80%-90% for at least 24 hours after dosing. For up to 4 hours after a 10-mg dose, pressor responses to exogenous angiotensin I were inhibited by 60%-90%.</p>
<p>Administration of benazepril to patients with mild-to-moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent, with no compensatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>. Symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span> is infrequent, although it can occur in patients who are salt and/or volume depleted (see WARNINGS, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span>). </p>
<p>In single-dose studies, benazepril <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314171" conceptname="Low blood pressure reading">lowered blood pressure</span> within 1 hour, with peak reductions achieved 2-4 hours after dosing. The antihypertensive effect of a single dose persisted for 24 hours. In multiple-dose studies, once-daily doses of 20-80 mg decreased seated pressure (systolic/diastolic) 24 hours after dosing by about 6-12/4-7 mmHg. The reductions at trough are about 50% of those seen at peak. </p>
<p>Four dose-response studies of benazepril monotherapy using once-daily dosing were conducted in 470 mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients not using diuretics. The minimal effective once-daily dose of benazepril was 10 mg; further <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falls</span> in blood pressure, especially at morning trough, were seen with higher doses in the studied dosing range (10-80 mg). In studies comparing the same daily dose of benazepril given as a single morning dose or as a twice-daily dose, blood pressure reductions at the time of morning trough blood levels were greater with the divided regimen.</p>
<p>During chronic therapy with benazepril, the maximum reduction in blood pressure with any given dose is generally achieved after 1-2 weeks. The antihypertensive effects of benazepril have continued during therapy for at least 2 years. Abrupt withdrawal of benazepril has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure.</p>
<p>In patients with mild-to-moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, total daily doses of Lotensin 20-40 mg were similar in effectiveness to total daily doses of captopril 50-100 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 25-50 mg, nifedipine SR 40-80 mg, and propranolol 80-160 mg. </p>
<p>The antihypertensive effects of benazepril were not appreciably different in patients receiving high- or low-sodium diets.</p>
<p>In hemodynamic studies in dogs, blood pressure reduction was accompanied by a reduction in peripheral arterial resistance, with an increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span> and renal blood flow and little or no change in heart rate. In normal human volunteers, single doses of benazepril caused an increase in renal blood flow but had no effect on glomerular filtration rate.</p>
<p>In clinical trials of <span class="Bold">benazepril/hydrochlorothiazide</span> using benazepril doses of 5-20 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25-25 mg, the antihypertensive effects were sustained for at least 24 hours, and they increased with increasing dose of either component. Although benazepril monotherapy is somewhat less effective in blacks than in nonblacks, the efficacy of combination therapy appears to be independent of race.</p>
<p>By blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, administration of benazepril tends to reduce the potassium loss associated with the diuretic. In clinical trials of Lotensin HCT, the average change in serum potassium was near zero in subjects who received 5/6.25 mg or 20/12.5 mg, but the average subject who received 10/12.5 mg or 20/25 mg experienced a mild reduction in serum potassium, similar to that experienced by the average subject receiving the same dose of hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span></span></h2>
<p class="First">Lotensin HCT can cause symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>. Like other ACE inhibitors, benazepril has been only rarely associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> in uncomplicated hypertensive patients. Symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume and/or salt depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>. Volume and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">salt depletion</span> should be corrected before initiating therapy with Lotensin HCT. </p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Fetal Toxicity </span></h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category D</span></p>
<p>Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.  Resulting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations.  Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090272" conceptname="Anuria">anuria</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.  When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Lotensin HCT as soon as possible.  These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy.  Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents.  Appropriate management of maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus.</p>
<p>In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus.  Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment.  If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> is observed, discontinue Lotensin HCT, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother.  Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy.  Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury.  Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to Lotensin HCT for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306451" conceptname="Oliguria">oliguria</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span> [<span class="Italics">see Precautions, Pediatric Use</span>].</p>
<p>No teratogenic effects of Lotensin were seen in studies of pregnant rats, mice, and rabbits. On a mg/m2 basis, the doses used in these studies were 60 times (in rats), 9 times (in mice), and more than 0.8 times (in rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose (assuming a 50-kg woman). On a mg/kg basis these these multiples are 300 times (in rats), 90 times (in mice), and more than 3 times (in rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose. When hydrochlorothiazide was orally administered without benazepril to pregnant mice and rats during their respective periods of major organogenesis, at doses up to 3000 and 1000 mg/kg/day respectively, there was no evidence of harm to the fetus. Similarly, no teratogenic effects of benazepril were seen in studies of pregnant rats, mice, and rabbits; on a mg/kg basis, the doses used in these studies were 300 times (in rats), 90 times (in mice), and more than 3 times (in rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose.</p>

<p>The opposite effects of benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide on serum potassium will approximately balance each other in many patients, so that no net effect upon serum potassium will be seen. In other patients, one or the other effect may be dominant. Initial and periodic determinations of serum electrolytes to detect possible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022093" conceptname="Electrolyte imbalance">electrolyte imbalance</span> should be performed at appropriate intervals. </p>
<p>Chloride deficits are generally mild and require specific treatment only under extraordinary circumstances (e.g., in liver disease or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>). Dilutional <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">hyponatremia</span> may occur in edematous patients; appropriate therapy is water restriction rather than administration of salt, except in rare instances when the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">hyponatremia</span> is life-threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.  </p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Potassium Supplements and Potassium</span><span class="Bold Italics">-Sparing Diuretics: </span>As noted above (Derangements of Serum Electrolytes), the net effect of Lotensin HCT may be to elevate a patient’s serum potassium, to reduce it, or to leave it unchanged. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span>. If concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient’s serum potassium should be monitored frequently.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Lithium:</span><span class="Bold"> </span>Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium toxicity</span> have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. Because renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium toxicity</span> is presumably raised further when, as in therapy with Lotensin HCT, a thiazide diuretic is coadministered with the ACE inhibitor. Lotensin HCT and lithium should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Gold:</span> Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318566" conceptname="Flushing">facial flushing</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors): </span>In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including benazepril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span>. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving benazepril and NSAID therapy.</p>
<p>
The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors and thiazide diuretics may be attenuated by NSAIDs. The diuretic and natriuretic effects of thiazide diuretics may also be reduced when NSAIDs are coadministered.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Other:</span><span class="Bold"> </span>Benazepril has been used concomitantly with beta-adrenergic-blocking agents, calcium-blocking agents, cimetidine, diuretics, digoxin, and hydralazine without evidence of clinically important adverse interactions. Other ACE inhibitors have had less than additive effects with beta-adrenergic blockers, presumably because drugs of both classes lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system.  </p>
<p>Interaction studies with warfarin and acenocoumarol have failed to identify any clinically important effects of benazepril on the serum concentrations or clinical effects of these anticoagulants.</p>
<p>Insulin requirements in diabetic patients may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. </p>
<p>Thiazides may decrease arterial responsiveness to norepinephrine, but not enough to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use.  </p>
<p>Thiazides may increase the responsiveness to tubocurarine.  </p>
<p>The diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics may be reduced by concurrent administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents.</p>
<p>Cholestyramine and colestipol resins: Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility </span></h2>
<p class="First">No evidence of carcinogenicity was found when<span class="Bold"> benazepril</span> was given to rats and mice for 104 weeks at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day. On a body-weight basis, this dose is over 100 times the maximum recommended human dose; on a body-surface-area basis, this dose is 18 times (rats) and 9 times (mice) the maximum recommended human dose. No mutagenic activity was detected in the Ames test in bacteria (with or without metabolic activation), in an in vitro test for forward mutations in cultured mammalian cells, or in a nucleus anomaly test. At doses of 50-500 mg/kg/day (38-375 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body-weight basis; 6-61 times the maximum recommended dose on a body-surface-area basis), benazepril had no adverse effect on the reproductive performance of male and female rats.</p>
<p>Under the auspices of the National Toxicology Program, rats and mice received <span class="Bold">hydrochlorothiazide</span> in their feed for 2 years, at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in mice and up to 100 mg/kg/day in rats. These studies uncovered no evidence of a carcinogenic potential of hydrochlorothiazide in rats or female mice, but there was equivocal evidence of hepatocarcinogenicity in male mice. Hydrochlorothiazide was not genotoxic in in vitro assays using <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, TA 1537, and TA 1538 of <span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span> typhimurium</span> (the Ames test); in the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) test for chromosomal aberrations; or in in vivo assays using mouse germinal cell chromosomes, Chinese hamster bone marrow chromosomes, and the <span class="Italics">Drosophila</span><span class="Italics"> </span>sex-linked recessive lethal trait gene. Positive test results were obtained in the in vitro CHO Sister Chromatid Exchange (clastogenicity) test and in the Mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">Lymphoma</span> Cell (mutagenicity) assays, using concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide of 43-1300 µg/mL. Positive test results were also obtained in the <span class="Italics">Aspergillus</span> <span class="Italics">nidulans </span>nondisjunction assay, using an unspecified concentration of hydrochlorothiazide. </p>
<p>Hydrochlorothiazide had no adverse effects on the fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies wherein these species were exposed, via their diets, to doses up to 100 and 4 mg/kg/day, respectively, prior to mating and throughout gestation. </p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers</span></h2>
<p class="First">Minimal amounts of unchanged benazepril and benazeprilat are excreted into the breast milk of lactating women treated with benazepril, so that a newborn child ingesting nothing but breast milk would receive less than 0.1% of the maternal doses of benazepril and benazeprilat. Thiazides, on the other hand, are definitely excreted into breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from hydrochlorothiazide and the unknown effects of benazepril in infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue Lotensin HCT, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Geriatric Use</span></h2>
<p class="First">Of the total number of patients who received Lotensin HCT in U.S. clinical studies of Lotensin HCT, 19% were 65 or older while about 1.5% were 75 or older. Overall differences in effectiveness or safety were not observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. </p>
<p>Benazepril and benazeprilat are substantially excreted by the kidney. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span></h1>
<p class="First">Lotensin HCT has been evaluated for safety in over 2500 patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>; over 500 of these patients were treated for at least 6 months, and over 200 were treated for more than 1 year.</p>
<p>The reported side effects were generally mild and transient, and there was no relationship between side effects and age, sex, race, or duration of therapy. Discontinuation of therapy due to side effects was required in approximately 7% of U.S. patients treated with Lotensin HCT and in 4% of patients treated with placebo. </p>
<p>The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with Lotensin HCT in U.S. studies were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> (1.0%; see<span class="Bold"> </span>PRECAUTIONS), “dizziness?

<h1><span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span></h1>
<p class="First">No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with Lotensin HCT; treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Therapy with Lotensin HCT should be discontinued, and the patient should be observed. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435796" conceptname="Dehydration">Dehydration</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022093" conceptname="Electrolyte imbalance">electrolyte imbalance</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> should be treated by established procedures.  </p>
<p>Single oral doses of 1 g/kg of benazepril caused reduced activity in mice, and doses of 3 g/kg were associated with significant lethality. Reduction of activity in rats was not seen until they had received doses of 5 g/kg, and doses of 6 g/kg were not lethal. In single-dose studies of hydrochlorothiazide, most rats survived doses up to 2.75 g/kg.</p>
<p>Data from human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> of benazepril are scanty, but the most common manifestation of human benazepril overdosage is likely to be <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>. In human hydrochlorothiazide <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, the most common signs and symptoms observed have been those of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435796" conceptname="Dehydration">dehydration</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4077438" conceptname="Electrolyte depletion">electrolyte depletion</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4016089" conceptname="Hypochloremia">hypochloremia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">hyponatremia</span>). If digitalis has also been administered, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span> may accentuate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmias</span>.</p>
<p>Laboratory determinations of serum levels of benazepril and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of benazepril <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. </p>
<p>No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of benazepril and its metabolites. Benazeprilat is only slightly dialyzable, but dialysis might be considered in overdosed patients with severely <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> (see WARNINGS).</p>
<p>Angiotensin II could presumably serve as a specific antagonist-antidote in the setting of benazepril <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, but angiotensin II is essentially unavailable outside of scattered research facilities. Because the hypotensive effect of benazepril is achieved through vasodilation and effective <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436375" conceptname="Hypovolemia">hypovolemia</span>, it is reasonable to treat benazepril <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> by infusion of normal saline solution.</p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34068-7">

<h1><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span></h1>
<p class="First">Benazepril is an effective treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> in once-daily doses of 10-80 mg, while hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5-50 mg per day. In clinical trials of benazepril/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using benazepril doses of 5-20 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25-25 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing dose of either component. </p>
<p>The side effects (see WARNINGS) of benazepril are generally rare and apparently independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>) and dose-independent phenomena (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192640" conceptname="Pancreatitis">pancreatitis</span>), the former much more common than the latter. Therapy with any combination of benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide will be associated with both sets of dose-independent side effects, but regimens in which benazepril is combined with low doses of hydrochlorothiazide produce minimal effects on serum potassium. In clinical trials of Lotensin HCT, the average change in serum potassium was near zero in subjects who received 5/6.25 mg or 20/12.5 mg, but the average subject who received 10/12.5 mg or 20/25 mg experienced a mild reduction in serum potassium, similar to that experienced by the average subject receiving the same dose of hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy.</p>
<p>To minimize dose-independent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Dose Titration Guided by Clinical Effect:</span><span class="Bold"> </span>A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with benazepril monotherapy may be switched to Lotensin HCT 10/12.5 or Lotensin HCT 20/12.5. Further increases of either or both components could depend on clinical response. The hydrochlorothiazide dose should generally not be increased until 2-3 weeks have elapsed. Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 25 mg of daily hydrochlorothiazide, but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen, may achieve similar blood-pressure control without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022093" conceptname="Electrolyte imbalance">electrolyte disturbance</span> if they are switched to Lotensin HCT 5/6.25.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Replacement Therapy:</span><span class="Bold"> </span>The combination may be substituted for the titrated individual components.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Use in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal Impairment</span>:</span><span class="Bold"> </span>Regimens of therapy with Lotensin HCT need not take account of renal function as long as the patient’s creatinine clearance is &gt;30 mL/min/1.73m<span class="Sup">2</span> (serum creatinine roughly ≤3 mg/dL or 265 µmol/L). In patients with more severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides, so Lotensin HCT is not recommended (see WARNINGS).</p>
