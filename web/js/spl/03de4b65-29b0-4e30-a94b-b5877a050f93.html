<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Sotalol hydrochloride is an antiarrhythmic drug with Class II (beta-adrenoreceptor blocking) and Class III (cardiac action potential duration prolongation) properties. It is supplied as a light-blue, capsule-shaped tablet for oral administration. Sotalol hydrochloride is a white, crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 308.8. It is hydrophilic, soluble in water, propylene glycol and ethanol, but is only slightly soluble in chloroform. Chemically, sotalol hydrochloride is d,l-<span class="Italics">N</span>-[4-[1-hydroxy-2-[(1-methylethyl)amino]ethyl]phenyl]methane-sulfonamide monohydrochloride. The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">12</span>H<span class="Sub">20</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">3</span>S•HCl and is represented by the following structural formula:</p>

<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Sotalol hydrochloride has both beta-adrenoreceptor blocking (Vaughan Williams Class II) and cardiac action potential duration prolongation (Vaughan Williams Class III) antiarrhythmic properties. Sotalol hydrochloride is a racemic mixture of d- and l-sotalol. Both isomers have similar Class III antiarrhythmic effects, while the l-isomer is responsible for virtually all of the beta-blocking activity. The beta-blocking effect of sotalol is non-cardioselective, half maximal at about 80 mg/day and maximal at doses between 320 and 640 mg/day. Sotalol does not have partial agonist or membrane stabilizing activity. Although significant beta-blockade occurs at oral doses as low as 25 mg, significant Class III effects are seen only at daily doses of 160 mg and above.</p>
<p>In children, a Class III electrophysiologic effect can be seen at daily doses of 210 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area (BSA). A reduction of the resting heart rate due to the beta-blocking effect of sotalol is observed at daily doses ≥ 90 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> in children.</p>

<h2>Electrophysiology</h2>
<p class="First">Sotalol hydrochloride prolongs the plateau phase of the cardiac action potential in the isolated myocyte, as well as in isolated tissue preparations of ventricular or atrial muscle (Class III activity). In intact animals it slows heart rate, decreases AV nodal conduction and increases the refractory periods of atrial and ventricular muscle and conduction tissue.</p>
<p>In man, the Class II (beta-blockade) electrophysiological effects of sotalol are manifested by increased sinus cycle length (slowed heart rate), decreased AV nodal conduction and increased AV nodal refractoriness. The Class III electrophysiological effects in man include prolongation of the atrial and ventricular monophasic action potentials, and effective refractory period prolongation of atrial muscle, ventricular muscle, and atrioventricular accessory pathways (where present) in both the anterograde and retrograde directions. With oral doses of 160 to 640 mg/day, the surface ECG shows dose-related mean increases of 40 to 100 msec in QT and 10 to 40 msec in QT<span class="Sub">c</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_8dd146b2-7eaa-4173-a4d9-bec7990dea32">WARNINGS</a></span> for description of relationship between QT<span class="Sub">c</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135823" conceptname="Torsades de pointes">torsade de pointes</span> type <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span>). No significant alteration in QRS interval is observed.</p>
<p>In a small study (n = 25) of patients with implanted defibrillators treated concurrently with sotalol, the average defibrillatory threshold was 6 joules (range 2 to 15 joules) compared to a mean of 16 joules for a non-randomized comparative group primarily receiving amiodarone.</p>
<p>Twenty-five children in an unblinded, multicenter trial with supraventricular (SVT) and/or ventricular (VT) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachyarrhythmias</span>, aged between 3 days and 12 years (mostly neonates and infants), received an ascending titration regimen with daily doses of 30, 90 and 210 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> with dosing every 8 hours for a total 9 doses. During steady-state, the respective average increases above baseline of the QT<span class="Sub">c</span> interval, in msec (%), were 2(+1%), 14(+4%) and 29(+7%) msec at the 3 dose levels. The respective mean maximum increases above baseline of the QT<span class="Sub">c</span> interval, in msec (%), were 23(+6%), 36(+9%) and 55(+14%) msec at the 3 dose levels. The steady-state percent increases in the RR interval were 3, 9 and 12%. The smallest children (BSA&lt;0.33m<span class="Sup">2</span>) showed a tendency for larger Class III effects (ΔQT<span class="Sub">c</span>) and an increased frequency of prolongations of the QT<span class="Sub">c</span> interval as compared with larger children (BSA≥0.33m<span class="Sup">2</span>). The beta-blocking effects also tended to be greater in the smaller children (BSA&lt;0.33m<span class="Sup">2</span>). Both the Class III and beta-blocking effects of sotalol were linearly related with the plasma concentrations.</p>

<h2>Hemodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">In a study of systemic hemodynamic function measured invasively in 12 patients with a mean LV <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4108582" conceptname="Left ventricular ejection fraction">ejection fraction</span> of 37% and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">ventricular tachycardia</span> (9 sustained and 3 non-sustained), a median dose of 160 mg twice daily of sotalol hydrochloride produced a 28% reduction in heart rate and a 24% decrease in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208254" conceptname="Cardiac index">cardiac index</span> at 2 hours post dosing at steady-state. Concurrently, systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4231869" conceptname="Stroke volume">stroke volume</span> showed non-significant increases of 25% and 8%, respectively. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure increased significantly from 6.4 mmHg to 11.8 mmHg in the 11 patients who completed the study. One patient was discontinued because of worsening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>. Mean arterial pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> work index did not significantly change. Exercise and isoproterenol induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span> are antagonized by sotalol and total peripheral resistance increases by a small amount.</p>
<p>In hypertensive patients, sotalol hydrochloride produces significant reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Although sotalol hydrochloride is usually well-tolerated hemodynamically, caution should be exercised in patients with marginal cardiac compensation as deterioration in cardiac performance may occur (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_d2b215a1-71f9-4087-a2ef-e0b06ec71eb5">WARNINGS: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">Congestive Heart Failure</span></a></span>).</p>

<h2>Clinical Studies</h2>
<p class="First">Sotalol hydrochloride has been studied in life-threatening and less severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span>. In patients with frequent premature ventricular complexes (VPC), sotalol hydrochloride was significantly superior to placebo in reducing VPCs, paired VPCs and non-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">sustained ventricular tachycardia</span> (NSVT); the response was dose-related through 640 mg/day with 80 to 85% of patients having at least a 75% reduction of VPCs. Sotalol hydrochloride was also superior, at the doses evaluated, to propranolol (40 to 80 mg TID) and similar to quinidine (200 to 400 mg QID) in reducing VPCs. In patients with life-threatening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span> [<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">sustained ventricular tachycardia</span>/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226399" conceptname="Fibrillation">fibrillation</span> (VT/VF)], sotalol hydrochloride was studied acutely [by suppression of programmed electrical stimulation (PES) induced VT and by suppression of Holter monitor evidence of sustained VT] and, in acute responders, chronically.</p>
<p>In a double-blind, randomized comparison of sotalol and procainamide given intravenously (total of 2 mg/kg sotalol hydrochloride vs. 19 mg/kg of procainamide over 90 minutes), sotalol suppressed PES induction in 30% of patients vs. 20% for procainamide (p = 0.2).</p>
<p>In a randomized clinical trial [Electrophysiologic Study Versus Electrocardiographic Monitoring (ESVEM) Trial] comparing choice of antiarrhythmic therapy by PES suppression vs. Holter monitor selection (in each case followed by treadmill exercise testing) in patients with a history of sustained VT/VF who were also inducible by PES, the effectiveness acutely and chronically of sotalol hydrochloride was compared with 6 other drugs (procainamide, quinidine, mexiletine, propafenone, imipramine and pirmenol). Overall response, limited to first randomized drug, was 39% for sotalol and 30% for the pooled other drugs. Acute response rate for first drug randomized using suppression of PES induction was 36% for sotalol vs. a mean of 13% for the other drugs. Using the Holter monitoring endpoint (complete suppression of sustained VT, 90% suppression of NSVT, 80% suppression of VPC pairs, and at least 70% suppression of VPCs), sotalol yielded 41% response vs. 45% for the other drugs combined. Among responders placed on long-term therapy identified acutely as effective (by either PES or Holter), sotalol, when compared to the pool of other drugs, had the lowest two-year mortality (13% vs. 22%), the lowest two-year VT recurrence rate (30% vs. 60%), and the lowest withdrawal rate (38% vs. about 75 to 80%). The most commonly used doses of sotalol hydrochloride in this trial were 320 to 480 mg/day (66% of patients), with 16% receiving 240 mg/day or less and 18% receiving 640 mg or more.</p>
<p>It cannot be determined, however, in the absence of a controlled comparison of sotalol vs. no pharmacologic treatment (e.g., in patients with implanted defibrillators) whether sotalol response causes improved survival or identifies a population with a good prognosis.</p>
<p>In a large double-blind, placebo controlled secondary prevention (post-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4206471" conceptname="Infarct">infarction</span>) trial (n = 1,456), sotalol hydrochloride was given as a non-titrated initial dose of 320 mg once daily. Sotalol did not produce a significant increase in survival (7.3% mortality on sotalol vs. 8.9% on placebo, p = 0.3), but overall did not suggest an adverse effect on survival. There was, however, a suggestion of an early (i.e., first 10 days) excess mortality (3% on sotalol vs. 2% on placebo). In a second small trial (n = 17 randomized to sotalol) where sotalol was administered at high doses (e.g., 320 mg twice daily) to high-risk post-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4206471" conceptname="Infarct">infarction</span> patients (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4108582" conceptname="Left ventricular ejection fraction">ejection fraction</span> &lt;40% and either &gt;10 VPC/hr or VT on Holter), there were 4 fatalities and 3 serious hemodynamic/electrical adverse events within two weeks of initiating sotalol.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">In healthy subjects, the oral bioavailability of sotalol hydrochloride is 90 to 100%. After oral administration, peak plasma concentrations are reached in 2.5 to 4 hours, and steady-state plasma concentrations are attained within 2 to 3 days (i.e., after 5 to 6 doses when administered twice daily). Over the dosage range 160 to 640 mg/day sotalol hydrochloride displays dose proportionality with respect to plasma concentrations. Distribution occurs to a central (plasma) and to a peripheral compartment, with a mean elimination half-life of 12 hours. Dosing every 12 hours results in trough plasma concentrations which are approximately one-half of those at peak. </p>
<p>Sotalol hydrochloride does not bind to plasma proteins and is not metabolized. Sotalol hydrochloride shows very little intersubject variability in plasma levels. The pharmacokinetics of the d and l enantiomers of sotalol are essentially identical. Sotalol hydrochloride crosses the blood brain barrier poorly. Excretion is predominantly via the kidney in the unchanged form, and therefore, lower doses are necessary in conditions of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_dfa3620c-4a27-4467-a3c6-e5a9959b5e2e">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>). Age per se does not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of sotalol, but <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> in geriatric patients can increase the terminal elimination half-life, resulting in increased drug accumulation. The absorption of sotalol hydrochloride was reduced by approximately 20% compared to fasting when it was administered with a standard meal. Since sotalol hydrochloride is not subject to first-pass metabolism, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> show no alteration in clearance of sotalol. </p>
<p>The combined analysis of two unblinded, multicenter trials (a single dose and a multiple dose study) with 59 children, aged between 3 days and 12 years, showed the pharmacokinetics of sotalol to be first order. A daily dose of 30 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> of sotalol was administered in the single dose study and daily doses of 30, 90 and 210 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> were administered q8h in the multi-dose study. After rapid absorption with peak levels occurring on average between 2 to 3 hours following administration, sotalol was eliminated with a mean half-life of 9.5 hours. Steady-state was reached after 1 to 2 days. The average peak to trough concentration ratio was 2. BSA was the most important covariate and more relevant than age for the pharmacokinetics of sotalol. The smallest children (BSA&lt;0.33m<span class="Sup">2</span>) exhibited a greater drug exposure (+59%) than the larger children who showed a uniform drug concentration profile. The intersubject variation for oral clearance was 22%.</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Oral sotalol hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of documented <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span>, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">sustained ventricular tachycardia</span>, that in the judgment of the physician are life-threatening. Because of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">proarrhythmic effects</span> of sotalol (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_8dd146b2-7eaa-4173-a4d9-bec7990dea32">WARNINGS</a></span>), including a 1.5 to 2% rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135823" conceptname="Torsades de pointes">torsade de pointes</span> or new VT/VF in patients with either NSVT or supraventricular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span>, its use in patients with less severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span>, even if the patients are symptomatic, is generally not recommended. Treatment of patients with asymptomatic ventricular premature contractions should be avoided.</p>
<p>Initiation of sotalol treatment or increasing doses, as with other antiarrhythmic agents used to treat life-threatening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span>, should be carried out in the hospital. The response to treatment should then be evaluated by a suitable method (e.g., PES or Holter monitoring) prior to continuing the patient on chronic therapy. Various approaches have been used to determine the response to antiarrhythmic therapy, including sotalol.</p>
<p>In the ESVEM Trial, response by Holter monitoring was tentatively defined as 100% suppression of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">ventricular tachycardia</span>, 90% suppression of non-sustained VT, 80% suppression of paired VPCs, and 75% suppression of total VPCs in patients who had at least 10 VPCs/hour at baseline; this tentative response was confirmed if VT lasting 5 or more beats was not observed during treadmill exercise testing using a standard Bruce protocol. The PES protocol utilized a maximum of three extrastimuli at three pacing cycle lengths and two right ventricular pacing sites. Response by PES was defined as prevention of induction of the following: 1) monomorphic VT lasting over 15 seconds; 2) non-sustained polymorphic VT containing more than 15 beats of monomorphic VT in patients with a history of monomorphic VT; 3) polymorphic VT or VF greater than 15 beats in patients with VF or a history of aborted <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4132309" conceptname="Sudden death">sudden death</span> without monomorphic VT; and 4) two episodes of polymorphic VT or VF of greater than 15 beats in a patient presenting with monomorphic VT. Sustained VT or NSVT producing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> during the final treadmill test was considered a drug failure.</p>
<p>In a multicenter open-label long-term study of sotalol in patients with life-threatening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span> which had proven refractory to other antiarrhythmic medications, response by Holter monitoring was defined as in ESVEM. Response by PES was defined as non-inducibility of sustained VT by at least double extrastimuli delivered at a pacing cycle length of 400 msec. Overall survival and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span> recurrence rates in this study were similar to those seen in ESVEM, although there was no comparative group to allow a definitive assessment of outcome.</p>
<p>Antiarrhythmic drugs have not been shown to enhance survival in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span>.</p>

<p class="First">Like other antiarrhythmic agents, sotalol can provoke new or worsened <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span> in some patients, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">sustained ventricular tachycardia</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437894" conceptname="Ventricular fibrillation">ventricular fibrillation</span>, with potentially fatal consequences.

The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135823" conceptname="Torsades de pointes">torsade de pointes</span> progressively increases with prolongation of the QT interval, and is worsened also by reduction in heart rate and reduction in serum potassium (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_7d58e900-9745-47a7-9d90-058b7ca2d64e"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022093" conceptname="Electrolyte imbalance">Electrolyte Disturbances</span></a></span>).</p>
<p>Because of the variable temporal recurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span>, it is not always possible to distinguish between a new or aggravated arrhythmic event and the patient's underlying rhythm disorder. (Note, however, that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135823" conceptname="Torsades de pointes">torsade de pointes</span> is usually a drug-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span> in people with an initially normal QT<span class="Sub">c</span>.) Thus, the incidence of drug-related events cannot be precisely determined, so that the occurrence rates provided must be considered approximations. Note also that drug-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span> may often not be identified, particularly if they occur long after starting the drug, due to less frequent monitoring. It is clear from the NIH-sponsored CAST (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_37697a66-8cb0-4bf2-994f-81f92ce2a8c3">WARNINGS: Mortality</a></span>) that some antiarrhythmic drugs can cause increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4132309" conceptname="Sudden death">sudden death</span> mortality, presumably due to new <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">asystole</span>, that do not appear early in treatment but that represent a sustained increased risk.</p>
<p>Overall in clinical trials with sotalol, 4.3% of 3257 patients experienced a new or worsened <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmia</span>. Of this 4.3%, there was new or worsened <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">sustained ventricular tachycardia</span> in approximately 1% of patients and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135823" conceptname="Torsades de pointes">torsade de pointes</span> in 2.4%. Additionally, in approximately 1% of patients, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> were considered possibly drug-related; such cases, although difficult to evaluate, may have been associated with proarrhythmic events. <span class="Bold">In patients with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">sustained ventricular tachycardia</span>, the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135823" conceptname="Torsades de pointes">torsade de pointes</span> was 4% and worsened VT in about 1%; in patients with other, less serious, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span> and supraventricular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span>, the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135823" conceptname="Torsades de pointes">torsade de pointes</span> was 1% and 1.4%, respectively.</span></p>

Of the patients experiencing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135823" conceptname="Torsades de pointes">torsade de pointes</span>, approximately two-thirds spontaneously reverted to their baseline rhythm.

<p>Nonetheless, sotalol should be used with particular caution if the QT<span class="Sub">c</span> is greater than 500 msec on-therapy and serious consideration should be given to reducing the dose or discontinuing therapy when the QT<span class="Sub">c</span> exceeds 550 msec.

<p class="First">The most common signs to be expected are <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256717" conceptname="Bronchospasm">bronchospasm</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. In cases of massive intentional overdosage (2 to 16 grams) of sotalol hydrochloride the following clinical findings were seen: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>, cardiac <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">asystole</span>, prolongation of QT interval, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135823" conceptname="Torsades de pointes">torsade de pointes</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">ventricular tachycardia</span>, and premature ventricular complexes. If overdosage occurs, therapy with sotalol should be discontinued and the patient observed closely. Because of the lack of protein binding, hemodialysis is useful for reducing sotalol plasma concentrations. Patients should be carefully observed until QT intervals are normalized and the heart rate returns to levels &gt;50 bpm. The occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> following an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> may be associated with an initial slow drug elimination phase (half-life of 30 hours) thought to be due to a temporary reduction of renal function caused by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>.

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">As with other antiarrhythmic agents, sotalol hydrochloride should be initiated and doses increased in a hospital with facilities for cardiac rhythm monitoring and assessment (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_74eb9a6e-d8a9-4f32-a99e-48442ca6cd0b">	INDICATIONS AND USAGE</a></span>	). Sotalol should be administered only after appropriate clinical assessment (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_74eb9a6e-d8a9-4f32-a99e-48442ca6cd0b">	INDICATIONS AND USAGE</a></span>	), and the dosage of sotalol hydrochloride must be individualized for each patient on the basis of therapeutic response and tolerance. Proarrhythmic events can occur not only at initiation of therapy, but also with each upward dosage adjustment.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34068-7">
<a name="LINK_9b3e8a22-d4e9-4cd8-8318-15b6d0ba8e82"></a><a name="section-9.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Adults</h2>
<p class="First">Dosage of sotalol hydrochloride should be adjusted gradually, allowing 3 days between dosing increments in order to attain steady-state plasma concentrations, and to allow monitoring of QT intervals. Graded dose adjustment will help prevent the usage of doses which are higher than necessary to control the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span>. The recommended initial dose is 80 mg twice daily. This dose may be increased, if necessary, after appropriate evaluation to 240 or 320 mg/day (120 to 160 mg twice daily). In most patients, a therapeutic response is obtained at a total daily dose of 160 to 320 mg/day, given in two or three divided doses. Some patients with life-threatening refractory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span> may require doses as high as 480 to 640 mg/day; however, these doses should only be prescribed when the potential benefit outweighs the increased risk of adverse events, in particular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">proarrhythmia</span>. Because of the long terminal elimination half-life of sotalol, dosing on more than a BID regimen is usually not necessary.</p>

<h2>Children</h2>
<p class="First">As in adults the following precautionary measures should be considered when initiating sotalol treatment in children: initiation of treatment in the hospital after appropriate clinical assessment; individualized regimen as appropriate; gradual increase of doses if required; careful assessment of therapeutic response and tolerability; and frequent monitoring of the QT<span class="Sub">c</span> interval and heart rate.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">For children aged about 2 years and greater</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">For children aged about 2 years and greater, with normal renal function, doses normalized for body surface area are appropriate for both initial and incremental dosing. Since the Class III potency in children (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_c6e33b6e-09d3-4924-917b-7e71b7064005">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span>) is not very different from that in adults, reaching plasma concentrations that occur within the adult dose range is an appropriate guide. From pediatric pharmacokinetic data the following is recommended.</p>
<p>For initiation of treatment, 30 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> three times a day (90 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> total daily dose) is approximately equivalent to the initial 160 mg total daily dose for adults. Subsequent titration to a maximum of 60 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (approximately equivalent to the 360 mg total daily dose for adults) can then occur. Titration should be guided by clinical response, heart rate and QT<span class="Sub">c</span>, with increased dosing being preferably carried out in-hospital. At least 36 hours should be allowed between dose increments to attain steady-state plasma concentrations of sotalol in patients with age-adjusted normal renal function.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">For children aged about 2 years or younger</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">For children aged about 2 years or younger, the above pediatric dosage should be reduced by a factor that depends heavily upon age, as shown in the following graph, age plotted on a logarithmic scale in months.</p>
<div class="Figure">
<a name="id1915"></a><img alt="This is a graph of age plotted on a logarithmic scale in months." src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=03de4b65-29b0-4e30-a94b-b5877a050f93&amp;name=sotalol-2.jpg">
</div>
<p>For a child aged 20 months, the dosing suggested for children with normal renal function aged 2 years or greater should be multiplied by about 0.97; the initial starting dose would be (30 X 0.97) = 29.1 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, administered three times daily. For a child aged 1 month, the starting dose should be multiplied by 0.68; the initial starting dose would be (30 X 0.68) = 20 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, administered three times daily. For a child aged about 1 week, the initial starting dose should be multiplied by 0.3; the starting dose would be (30 X 0.3) = 9 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>. Similar calculations should be made for increased doses as titration proceeds. Since the half-life of sotalol decreases with decreasing age (below about 2 years), time to steady-state will also increase. Thus, in neonates the time to steady-state may be as long as a week or longer.</p>
<p>In all children, individualization of dosage is required. As in adults sotalol hydrochloride should be used with particular caution in children if the QT<span class="Sub">c</span> is greater than 500 msec on therapy, and serious consideration should be given to reducing the dose or discontinuing therapy when QT<span class="Sub">c</span> exceeds 550 msec.</p>

<h2>Preparation of Extemporaneous Oral Solution</h2>
<p class="First">Sotalol hydrochloride syrup 5 mg/mL can be compounded using Simple Syrup containing 0.1% sodium benzoate (Syrup, NF) available from Humco Laboratories as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>1.</dt>
<dd>Measure 120 mL of Simple Syrup.</dd>
<dt>2.</dt>
<dd>Transfer the syrup to a 6-ounce amber plastic (polyethylene terephthalate [PET]) prescription bottle. NOTE: An oversized bottle is used to allow for a headspace, so that there will be more effective mixing during <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">shaking</span> of the bottle.</dd>
<dt>3.</dt>
<dd>Add five (5) sotalol hydrochloride 120 mg tablets to the bottle. These tablets are added intact; it is not necessary to crush the tablets. NOTE: The addition of the tablets can also be done first. The tablets can also be crushed if preferred. If the tablets are crushed, care should be taken to transfer the entire quantity of tablet powder into the bottle containing the syrup.</dd>
<dt>4.</dt>
<dd>Shake the bottle to wet the entire surface of the tablets. If the tablets have been crushed, shake the bottle until the endpoint is achieved.</dd>
<dt>5.</dt>
<dd>Allow the tablets to hydrate for at least two hours.</dd>
<dt>6.</dt>
<dd>After at least two hours have elapsed, shake the bottle intermittently over the course of at least another two hours until the tablets are completely disintegrated. NOTE: The tablets can be allowed to hydrate overnight to simplify the disintegration process.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The endpoint is achieved when a dispersion of fine particles in the syrup is obtained.</p>
<p>This compounding procedure results in a solution containing 5 mg/mL of sotalol HCI. The fine solid particles are the water-insoluble inactive ingredients of the tablets.</p>
<p>This extemporaneously prepared oral solution of sotalol HCI (with suspended inactive particles) must be shaken well prior to administration. This is to ensure that the amount of inactive solid particles per dose remains constant throughout the duration of use.</p>
<p>Stability studies indicate that the suspension is stable for three months when stored at controlled room temperature (20°-25°C/68°-77°F) and ambient humidity.</p>
