<h1>Suicidality and Antidepressant Drugs</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of SURMONTIL or any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need.  Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. SURMONTIL is not approved for use in pediatric patients.

<p>SURMONTIL capsules contain trimipramine maleate equivalent to 25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg of trimipramine as the base.  The inactive ingredients present are black ink, FD&amp;C Blue 1, gelatin, lactose, magnesium stearate, and titanium dioxide.  The 25 mg dosage strength also contains benzyl alcohol, D&amp;C Yellow 10, edetate calcium disodium, FD&amp;C Yellow 6, parabens (butyl, propyl and methyl), sodium lauryl sulfate, and sodium propionate; the 50 mg dosage strength also contains benzyl alcohol, D&amp;C Red 28, edetate calcium disodium, FD&amp;C Red 40, FD&amp;C Yellow 6, parabens (butyl, propyl and methyl), sodium lauryl sulfate, and sodium propionate.</p>
<p>Trimipramine maleate is prepared as a racemic mixture which can be resolved into levorotatory and dextrorotatory isomers.  The asymmetric center responsible for optical isomerism is marked in the formula by an asterisk.  Trimipramine maleate is an almost odorless, white or slightly cream-colored, crystalline substance, melting at 140Â°-144Â° C.  It is very slightly soluble in ether and water, is slightly soluble in ethyl alcohol and acetone, and freely soluble in chloroform and methanol at 20Â° C.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">SURMONTIL is an antidepressant with an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>-reducing sedative component to its action.  The mode of action of SURMONTIL on the central nervous system is not known.  However, unlike amphetamine-type compounds it does not act primarily by stimulation of the central nervous system.  It does not act by inhibition of the monoamine oxidase system.</p>
<p>The single-dose pharmacokinetics of trimipramine were evaluated in a comparative study of 24 elderly subjects and 24 younger subjects; no clinically relevant differences were demonstrated based on age or gender.</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">SURMONTIL is indicated for the relief of symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.  Endogenous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> is more likely to be alleviated than other <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive states</span>.  In studies with neurotic outpatients, the drug appeared to be equivalent to amitriptyline in the less-depressed patients but somewhat less effective than amitriptyline in the more severely depressed patients.  In hospitalized depressed patients, trimipramine and imipramine were equally effective in relieving <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.</p>

<h2>Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)</h2>
<p class="First">The use of MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders with SURMONTIL or within 14 days of stopping treatment with SURMONTIL is contraindicated because of an increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span>.

<h2>Clinical Worsening and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> Risk</h2>
<p class="First">Patients with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and/or the emergence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4092095" conceptname="Planning suicide">suicidal ideation</span> and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> is a known risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (aged 18-24) with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.</p>
<p>The pooled analysis of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440374" conceptname="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">obsessive compulsive disorder</span> (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders including a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable with age strada and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.</p>

<p>No <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>.</p>
<p>It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.</p>
<p>All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. </p>

Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.</p>
<p>Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patientâ€™s presenting symptoms.</p>
<p>Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> or other indications, both psychiatric and non-psychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers.  Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers.  Prescriptions for SURMONTIL should be written for the smallest quantity of capsules consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. </p>
<p>Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder:  A major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive episode</span> may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder.  It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic episode</span> in patients at risk for bipolar disorder.  Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown.  However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>, bipolar disorder, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.

All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg.  No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses.  There may be circumstances when it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking SURMONTIL.

<h2>General Consideration for Use</h2>
<p class="First">Extreme caution should be used when this drug is given to patients with any evidence of cardiovascular disease because of the possibility of conduction defects, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">strokes</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>.</p>
<p>Caution is advised in patients with history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192450" conceptname="Retention of urine">urinary retention</span> because of the drugâ€™s anticholinergic properties; hyperthyroid patients or those on thyroid medication because of the possibility of cardiovascular toxicity; patients with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> disorder, because this drug has been shown to lower the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> threshold; patients receiving guanethidine or similar agents, since SURMONTIL (trimipramine maleate) may block the pharmacologic effects of these drugs.</p>
<p>Since the drug may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as operating an automobile or machinery, the patient should be cautioned accordingly.</p>

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with SURMONTIL and should counsel them in its appropriate use.  A patient Medication Guide about â€œAntidepressant Medicines, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> and other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actionsâ€? is available for SURMONTIL.  The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents.  Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have.  The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking SURMONTIL.</p>
<p>Clinical Worsening and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> Risk: Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021498" conceptname="Panic attack">panic attacks</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4195585" conceptname="Hostile behavior">hostility</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021344" conceptname="Abusive behavior">aggressiveness</span>, impulsivity, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4108925" conceptname="Akathisia">akathisia</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">psychomotor restlessness</span>), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333678" conceptname="Hypomania">hypomania</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">mania</span>, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4092095" conceptname="Planning suicide">suicidal ideation</span>, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down.  Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt.  Such symptoms should be reported to the patientâ€™s prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patientâ€™s presenting symptoms.  Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised that taking SURMONTIL can cause mild pupillary dilation, which in susceptible individuals, can lead to an episode of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432312" conceptname="Chronic angle-closure glaucoma">angle closure glaucoma</span>.  Pre-existing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437541" conceptname="Glaucoma">glaucoma</span> is almost always open-angle <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437541" conceptname="Glaucoma">glaucoma</span> because <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432312" conceptname="Chronic angle-closure glaucoma">angle closure glaucoma</span>, when diagnosed, can be treated definitively with iridectomy.

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Cimetidine</span></p>
<p>There is evidence that cimetidine inhibits the elimination of tricyclic antidepressants.  Downward adjustment of SURMONTIL dosage may be required if cimetidine therapy is initiated; upward adjustment if cimetidine therapy is discontinued.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Alcohol</span></p>
<p>Patients should be warned that the concomitant use of alcoholic beverages may be associated with exaggerated effects.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Catecholamines/Anticholinergics</span></p>
<p>It has been reported that tricyclic antidepressants can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.  Similarly, atropine-like effects may be more pronounced in patients receiving anticholinergic therapy.  Therefore, particular care should be exercised when it is necessary to administer tricyclic antidepressants with sympathomimetic amines, local decongestants, local anesthetics containing epinephrine, atropine or drugs with an anticholinergic effect.  In resistant cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> in adults, a dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day may have to be exceeded.  If a higher dose is needed, ECG monitoring should be maintained during the initiation of therapy and at appropriate intervals during stabilization of dose.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6</span></p>
<p>The biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase) is reduced in a subset of the caucasian population (about 7-10% of caucasians are so called â€œpoor metabolizersâ€?); reliable estimates of the prevalence of reduced P450 2D6 isozyme activity among Asian, African, and other populations are not yet available.  Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) when given usual doses.  Depending on the fraction of drug metabolized by P450 2D6, the increase in plasma concentration may be small, or quite large (8 fold increase in plasma AUC of the TCA).</p>
<p>In addition, certain drugs inhibit the activity of the isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers.  An individual who is stable on a given dose of TCA may become abruptly toxic when given one of these inhibiting drugs as concomitant therapy.  The drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 include some that are not metabolized by the enzyme (quinidine; cimetidine) and many that are substrates for P450 2D6 (many other antidepressants, phenothiazines, and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide).  While all the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine, inhibit P450 2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition.  The extent to which SSRI TCA interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved.  Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the co-administration of TCAs with any of the SSRIs and also in switching from one class to the other.  Of particular importance, sufficient time must elapse before initiating TCA treatment in a patient being withdrawn from fluoxetine, given the long half-life of the parent and active metabolite (at least 5 weeks may be necessary).</p>
<p>Concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the tricyclic antidepressant or the other drug.  Furthermore, whenever one of these other drugs is withdrawn from co-therapy, an increased dose of tricyclic antidepressant may be required.  It is desirable to monitor TCA plasma levels whenever a TCA is going to be co-administered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Semen studies in man (four schizophrenics and nine normal volunteers) revealed no significant changes in sperm morphology.  It is recognized that drugs having a parasympathetic effect, including tricyclic antidepressants, may alter the ejaculatory response.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of SURMONTIL (trimipramine maleate) were not adequate to determine whether subjects aged 65 and over respond differently from younger subjects.</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of trimipramine were not substantially altered in the elderly (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID_5cbc6523-fdd4-4a7e-83cd-4c8f86c23983">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span>).</p>
<p>SURMONTIL is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney.  Clinical circumstances, some of which may be more common in the elderly, such as hepatic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, should be considered (see<span class="Bold"><a href="#ID_8191b02a-b43c-4e9a-9410-606fb2767312">PRECAUTIONS</a> - <a href="#ID_8191b02a-b43c-4e9a-9410-606fb2767312">General</a></span>).</p>
<p>Greater sensitivity (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusional states</span>, sedation) of some older individuals cannot be ruled out (see<span class="Bold"><a href="#ID_736979dd-226a-4887-8ec5-8b8dcac07804">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span>).  In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at a lower dose (see<span class="Bold"><a href="#ID_0405739e-fa48-42fa-9b6d-9d979c63132c">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Dosage should be initiated at a low level and increased gradually, noting carefully the clinical response and any evidence of intolerance.</p>
<p>Lower dosages are recommended for elderly patients and adolescents.  Lower dosages are also recommended for outpatients as compared to hospitalized patients who will be under close supervision.  It is not possible to prescribe a single dosage schedule of SURMONTIL that will be therapeutically effective in all patients.  The physical psychodynamic factors contributing to depressive symptomatology are very complex; spontaneous remissions or exacerbations of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4191716" conceptname="Symptoms of depression">depressive symptoms</span> may occur with or without drug therapy.  Consequently, the recommended dosage regimens are furnished as a guide which may be modified by factors such as the age of the patient, chronicity and severity of the disease, medical condition of the patient, and degree of psychotherapeutic support.</p>
<p>Most antidepressant drugs have a lag period of ten days to four weeks before a therapeutic response is noted.  Increasing the dose will not shorten this period but rather increase the incidence of adverse reactions.</p>

<a name="ID_8aff271b-388b-45a6-8578-63530af7ee0f"></a><a name="section-8.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Usual Adult Dose</h2>
<p class="First">Outpatients and Office Patients â€”Initially, 75 mg/day in divided doses, increased to 150 mg/day.  Dosages over 200 mg/day are not recommended.  Maintenance therapy is in the range of 50 to 150 mg/day.  For convenient therapy and to facilitate patient compliance, the total dosage requirement may be given at bedtime.</p>
<p>Hospitalized Patientsâ€”Initially, 100 mg/day in divided doses.  This may be increased gradually in a few days to 200 mg/day, depending upon individual response and tolerance.  If improvement does not occur in 2 to 3 weeks, the dose may be increased to the maximum recommended dose of 250 to 300 mg/day.</p>
<p>Adolescent and Geriatric Patientsâ€”Initially, a dose of 50 mg/day is recommended, with gradual increments up to 100 mg/day, depending upon patient response and tolerance.</p>
<p>Maintenanceâ€”Following remission, maintenance medication may be required for a longer period of time, at the lowest dose that will maintain remission.  Maintenance therapy is preferably administered as a single dose at bedtime.  To minimize relapse, maintenance therapy should be continued for about three months.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Switching a Patient To or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Intended to Treat Psychiatric Disorders:</span> At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with SURMONTIL.  Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping SURMONTIL before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID_dad08ece-78ee-4ec5-9b41-4f5b9d473ea5">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span>).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Use of SURMONTIL With Other MAOIs, Such as Linezolid or Methylene Blue: </span>Do not start SURMONTIL in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue because there is increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span>.  In a patient who requires more urgent treatment of a psychiatric condition, other interventions, including hospitalization, should be considered (see<span class="Bold"><a href="#ID_dad08ece-78ee-4ec5-9b41-4f5b9d473ea5">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span>).</p>
<p>In some cases, a patient already receiving therapy with SURMONTIL may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue.  If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span> in a particular patient, SURMONTIL should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered.  The patient should be monitored for symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span> for 2 weeks or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, whichever comes first.  Therapy with SURMONTIL may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue (see<span class="Bold"><a href="#ID_b2178514-dc62-4827-80f0-d6b96e33d506">WARNINGS</a></span>).</p>
<p>The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg/kg with SURMONTIL is unclear.  The clinician should, nevertheless, be aware of the possibility of emergent symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span> with such use (see<span class="Bold"><a href="#ID_b2178514-dc62-4827-80f0-d6b96e33d506">WARNINGS</a></span>).</p>

<h2>Management</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">General</span></p>
<p>Obtain an ECG and immediately initiate cardiac monitoring.  Protect the patientâ€™s airway, establish an intravenous line and initiate gastric decontamination.  A minimum of six hours of observation with cardiac monitoring and observation for signs of CNS or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac dysrhythmias</span> and/or conduction blocks, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> is necessary.  If signs of toxicity occur at any time during this period, extended monitoring is required.  There are case reports of patients succumbing to fatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">dysrhythmias</span> late after <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>; these patients had clinical evidence of significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">poisoning</span> prior to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> and most received inadequate gastrointestinal decontamination.  Plasma drug levels may not reflect the severity of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">poisoning</span>.  Therefore, monitoring of plasma drug levels alone should not guide management of the patient.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal Decontamination</span></p>
<p>All patients suspected of tricyclic antidepressant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> should receive gastrointestinal decontamination.  This should include large volume gastric lavage followed by activated charcoal.  If consciousness is impaired, the airway should be secured prior to lavage.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">Emesis</span> is contraindicated.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular</span></p>
<p>A maximal limb-lead QRS duration of â‰¥ 0.10 seconds has been associated with an increased incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>.  A QRS duration of â‰¥ 0.16 seconds has been associated with an increased incidence of ventricular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">dysrhythmias</span>.  Intravenous sodium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span> should be used to maintain the serum pH in the range of 7.45 to 7.55.  If the pH response is inadequate, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316814" conceptname="Hyperventilation">hyperventilation</span> may also be used.  Concomitant use of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316814" conceptname="Hyperventilation">hyperventilation</span> and sodium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span> should be done with extreme caution, with frequent pH monitoring.  A pH &gt; 7.60 or a pCO2 &lt; 20 mm Hg is undesirable.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">Dysrhythmias</span> unresponsive to sodium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span> therapy/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316814" conceptname="Hyperventilation">hyperventilation</span> may respond to lidocaine, bretylium or phenytoin.  Type 1A and 1C antiarrhythmics are generally contraindicated (e.g., quinidine, disopyramide, and procainamide).</p>
<p>In rare instances, hemoperfusion may be beneficial in acute refractory cardiovascular instability in patients with acute toxicity.  However, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, exchange transfusions, and forced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span> generally have been reported as ineffective in tricyclic antidepressant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">poisoning</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">CNS</span></p>
<p>In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span>, early intubation is advised because of the potential for abrupt deterioration.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">Seizures</span> should be controlled with benzodiazepines, or if these are ineffective, other anticonvulsants (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin).  Physostigmine is not recommended except to treat life-threatening symptoms that have been unresponsive to other therapies, and then only in consultation with a poison control center.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Psychiatric Follow-up</span></p>
<p>Since overdosage is often deliberate, patients may attempt <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span> by other means during the recovery phase.  Psychiatric referral may be appropriate.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Pediatric Management</span></p>
<p>The principles of management of child and adult overdosages are similar.  It is strongly recommended that the physician contact the local poison control center for specific pediatric treatment.</p>
