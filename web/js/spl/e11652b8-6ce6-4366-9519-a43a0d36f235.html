<h2><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></h2>
<p class="First">Benazepril and benazeprilat inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and in animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex.</p>
<p>      Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. Hypertensive patients treated with benazepril and amlodipine for up to 56 weeks had elevations of serum potassium up to 0.2 mEq/L (see PRECAUTIONS).</p>
<p>      Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. In animal studies, benazepril had no inhibitory effect on the vasopressor response to angiotensin II and did not interfere with the hemodynamic effects of the autonomic neurotransmitters acetylcholine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine.</p>
<p>      ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of Lotrel remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>      While the mechanism through which benazepril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, benazepril has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with low-renin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>.</p>
<p>      Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow channel blocker) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be detected in vitro but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine. Within the physiologic pH range, amlodipine is an ionized compound (pKa=8.6), and its kinetic interaction with the calcium channel receptor is characterized by a gradual rate of association and dissociation with the receptor binding site, resulting in a gradual onset of effect.</p>
<p>      Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span> and reduction in blood pressure.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</span></h2>
<p class="First">The rate and extent of absorption of benazepril and amlodipine from Lotrel are not significantly different, respectively, from the rate and extent of absorption of benazepril and amlodipine from individual tablet formulations. Absorption from the individual tablets is not influenced by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract; food effects on absorption from Lotrel have not been studied.</p>
<p>      Following oral administration of Lotrel, peak plasma concentrations of benazepril are reached in 0.5-2 hours. Cleavage of the ester group (primarily in the liver) converts benazepril to its active metabolite, benazeprilat, which reaches peak plasma concentrations in 1.5-4 hours. The extent of absorption of benazepril is at least 37%.</p>
<p>      Peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine are reached 6-12 hours after administration of Lotrel; the extent of absorption is 64%-90%.</p>
<p>      The apparent volumes of <span class="Bold">distribution</span> of amlodipine and benazeprilat are about 21 L/kg and 0.7 L/kg, respectively. Approximately 93% of circulating amlodipine is bound to plasma proteins, and the bound fraction of benazeprilat is slightly higher. On the basis of in vitro studies, benazeprilat’s degree of protein binding should be unaffected by age, by hepatic dysfunction, or—over the therapeutic concentration range—by concentration.</p>
<p>      Benazeprilat has much greater ACE-inhibitory activity than benazepril, and the <span class="Bold">metabolism</span> of benazepril to benazeprilat is almost complete. Only trace amounts of an administered dose of benazepril can be recovered unchanged in the urine; about 20% of the dose is excreted as benazeprilat, 8% as benazeprilat glucuronide, and 4% as benazepril glucuronide.</p>
<p>      Amlodipine is extensively metabolized in the liver, with 10% of the parent compound and 60% of the metabolites excreted in the urine. In patients with hepatic dysfunction, decreased clearance of amlodipine may increase the area-under-the-plasma-concentration curve by 40%-60%, and dosage reduction may be required (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are essentially unaffected.</p>
<p>      Benazeprilat’s effective <span class="Bold">elimination</span> half-life is 10-11 hours, while that of amlodipine is about 2 days, so steady-state levels of the two components are achieved after about a week of once-daily dosing. The clearance of benazeprilat from the plasma is primarily renal, but biliary excretion accounts for 11%-12% of benazepril elimination in normal subjects. In patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min), peak benazeprilat levels and the time to steady state may be increased (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>, on the other hand, the pharmacokinetics of benazeprilat are essentially unaffected.</p>
<p>      Although the pharmacokinetics of benazepril and benazeprilat are unaffected by <span class="Bold">age</span>, clearance of amlodipine is decreased in the elderly, with resulting increases of 35%-70% in peak plasma levels, elimination half-life, and area-under-the-plasma-concentration curve. Dose adjustment may be required.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Pharmacodynamics</span></h2>
<p class="First">Single and multiple doses of 10 mg or more of <span class="Bold">benazepril</span> cause inhibition of plasma ACE activity by at least 80%-90% for at least 24 hours after dosing. For up to 4 hours after a 10-mg dose, pressor responses to exogenous angiotensin I were inhibited by 60%-90%.</p>
<p>      Administration of benazepril to patients with mild-to-moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent, with no compensatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>. Symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span> is infrequent, although it can occur in patients who are salt and/or volume depleted (see WARNINGS, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span>).</p>
<p>      The antihypertensive effects of benazepril were not appreciably different in patients receiving high- or low-sodium diets.</p>
<p>      In normal human volunteers, single doses of benazepril caused an increase in renal blood flow but had no effect on glomerular filtration rate.</p>
<p>      Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, <span class="Bold">amlodipine</span> produces vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients.</p>
<p>      As with other calcium channel blockers, hemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have generally demonstrated a small increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208254" conceptname="Cardiac index">cardiac index</span> without significant influence on dP/dt or on left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In hemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and humans, even when coadministered with beta blockers to humans.</p>
<p>      Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial (SA) nodal function or atrioventricular (AV) conduction in intact animals or humans. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta blockers to patients with either <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were observed.</p>
<p>      Over 950 patients received Lotrel once daily in six double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Lotrel <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314171" conceptname="Low blood pressure reading">lowered blood pressure</span> within 1 hour, with peak reductions achieved 2-8 hours after dosing. The antihypertensive effect of a single dose persisted for 24 hours.</p>
<p>      Once-daily doses of benazepril/amlodipine using benazepril doses of 10-20 mg and amlodipine doses of 2.5-10 mg decreased seated pressure (systolic/diastolic) 24 hours after dosing by about 10-25/6-13 mmHg.</p>
<p>      In two studies in patients not adequately controlled on either benazepril 40 mg alone (n=329) or amlodipine 10 mg alone (n=812) once daily doses of Lotrel 10/40 mg further decreased seated blood pressure compared to the respective monotherapy alone.</p>
<p>      Combination therapy was effective in blacks and nonblacks. Both components contributed to the antihypertensive efficacy in nonblacks, but virtually all of the antihypertensive effect in blacks could be attributed to the amlodipine component. Among nonblack patients in placebo-controlled trials comparing Lotrel to the individual components, the blood pressure lowering effects of the combination were shown to be additive and in some cases synergistic.</p>
<p>      During chronic therapy with Lotrel, the maximum reduction in blood pressure with any given dose is generally achieved after 1-2 weeks. The antihypertensive effects of Lotrel have continued during therapy for at least 1 year. Abrupt withdrawal of Lotrel has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions</span></h2>
<p class="First">Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including Lotrel) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious. These reactions usually occur after one of the first few doses of the ACE inhibitor, but they sometimes do not appear until after months of therapy.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span></span></h2>
<p class="First">Lotrel can cause symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>.

<h2>
<span class="Bold">Fetal/N</span><span class="Bold">eonatal Morbidity and Mortality</span>
</h2>
<p class="First">ACE inhibitors can cause fetal and neonatal morbidity and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> when administered to pregnant women. Several dozen cases have been reported in the world literature. When pregnancy is detected, Lotrel should be discontinued as soon as possible and monitoring of the fetal development should be performed on a regular basis.</p>
<p>      The use of ACE inhibitors during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy has been associated with fetal and neonatal injury, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, neonatal skull hypoplasia, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090272" conceptname="Anuria">anuria</span>, reversible or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198185" conceptname="Chronic renal failure">irreversible renal failure</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">Oligohydramnios</span> has also been reported, presumably resulting from decreased fetal renal function; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> in this setting has been associated with fetal limb <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208264" conceptname="Muscle contracture">contractures</span>, craniofacial deformation, and hypoplastic lung development. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439128" conceptname="Extreme immaturity">Prematurity</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80204" conceptname="Fetal growth restriction">intrauterine growth retardation</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315922" conceptname="Patent ductus arteriosus">patent ductus arteriosus</span> have also been reported, although it is not clear whether these occurrences were due to the ACE inhibitor exposure.</p>
<p>      In addition, use of ACE inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy has been associated with a potentially increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span>. In women planning to become pregnant, ACE inhibitors (including Lotrel) should not be used. Women of child-bearing age should be made aware of the potential risk and ACE inhibitors (including Lotrel) should only be given after careful counseling and consideration of individual risks and benefits.</p>
<p>      Rarely (probably less often than once in every thousand pregnancies), no alternative to ACE inhibitors will be found. In these rare cases, the mothers should be apprised of the potential hazards to their fetuses, and serial ultrasound examinations should be performed to assess the intra-amniotic environment.</p>
<p>      If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> is observed, benazepril should be discontinued unless it is considered life-saving for the mother. Contraction stress testing (CST), a nonstress test (NST), or biophysical profiling (BPP) may be appropriate, depending upon the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury.</p>
<p>      Infants with histories of in utero exposure to ACE inhibitors should be closely observed for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306451" conceptname="Oliguria">oliguria</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span>. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306451" conceptname="Oliguria">oliguria</span> occurs, attention should be directed toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusion or peritoneal dialysis may be required as means of reversing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> and/or substituting for disordered renal function. Benazepril, which crosses the placenta, can theoretically be removed from the neonatal circulation by these means; there are occasional reports of benefit from these maneuvers, but experience is limited.</p>
<p>      Lotrel has not been adequately studied in pregnant women. When rats received benazepril:amlodipine at doses ranging from 5:2.5 to 50:25 mg/kg/day, dystocia was observed with increasing dose-related incidence at all doses tested. On a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, the 2.5 mg/kg/day dose of amlodipine is 3.6 times the amlodipine dose delivered when the maximum recommended dose of Lotrel is given to a 50-kg woman. Similarly, the 5 mg/kg/day dose of benazepril is approximately 2 times the benazepril dose delivered when the maximum recommended dose of Lotrel is given to a 50-kg woman.</p>
<p>      No teratogenic effects were seen when benazepril and amlodipine were administered in combination to pregnant rats or rabbits. Rats received dose ratios up to 50:25 mg/kg/day (benazepril:amlodipine) (24 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, assuming a 50-kg woman). Rabbits received doses of up to 1.5:0.75 (benazepril:amlodipine) mg/kg/day; on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, this is 0.97 times the size of a maximum recommended dose of Lotrel given to a 50-kg woman.</p>
<p>      Similar results were seen in animal studies involving benazepril alone and amlodipine alone.</p>

When such patients are treated with Lotrel, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy.</p>
<p>      Some benazepril-treated hypertensive patients with <span class="Bold">no apparent preexisting renal vascular disease</span> have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when benazepril has been given concomitantly with a diuretic.

<h2><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Diuretics:</span></span> Patients on diuretics, especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with Lotrel. The possibility of hypotensive effects with Lotrel can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with Lotrel.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics:</span></span> Benazepril can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics.

<p class="First">No evidence of carcinogenicity was found when <span class="Bold">benazepril</span> was given, via dietary administration, to rats and mice for 104 weeks at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day. On a body-weight basis, this dose is over 100 times the maximum recommended human dose; on a body-surface-area basis, this dose is 18 times (rats) and 9 times (mice) the maximum recommended human dose. No mutagenic activity was detected in the Ames test in bacteria, in an in vitro test for forward mutations in cultured mammalian cells, or in a nucleus anomaly test. At doses of 50-500 mg/kg/day (38-375 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body-weight basis; 6-61 times the maximum recommended dose on a body-surface-area basis), benazepril had no adverse effect on the reproductive performance of male and female rats.</p>
<p>      Rats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for 2 years, at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg/day, showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. For mice, but not for rats, the highest dose was close to the maximum tolerated dose. On a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, this dose given to mice was approximately equal to the maximum recommended clinical dose. On the same basis, the same dose given to rats was approximately twice the maximum recommended clinical dose.</p>
<p>      Mutagenicity studies with amlodipine revealed no drug-related effects at either the gene or chromosome levels.</p>
<p>      There was no effect on the fertility of rats treated with amlodipine (males for 64 days and females for 14 days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum recommended human dose of 10 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, assuming a 50-kg person).</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Geriatric Use</span></h2>
<p class="First">Of the total number of patients who received Lotrel in U.S. clinical studies of Lotrel, over 19% were 65 or older while about 2% were 75 or older. Overall differences in effectiveness or safety were not observed between these patients and younger patients. Clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>      Benazepril and benazeprilat are substantially excreted by the kidney. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p>
<p>      Amlodipine is extensively metabolized in the liver. In the elderly, clearance of amlodipine is decreased with resulting increases in peak plasma levels, elimination half-life and area-under-the-plasma-concentration curve. Thus a lower starting dose may be required in older patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span></h1>
<p class="First">Only a few cases of human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> with amlodipine have been reported. One patient was asymptomatic after a 250-mg ingestion; another, who combined 70 mg of amlodipine with an unknown large quantity of a benzodiazepine, developed refractory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span> and died.</p>
<p>      Human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> with any combination of amlodipine and benazepril have not been reported. In scattered reports of human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> with benazepril and other ACE inhibitors, there are no reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.</p>
<p>      When mice were given single oral doses of benazepril/amlodipine, mortality was 20% at 50:25 mg/kg, 10% at 100:50 mg/kg, and 100% at 500:250 mg/kg. In rats, mortality was 25% (pooling two studies) at 500:250 mg/kg and 100% at 900:450 mg/kg.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Treatment:</span></span> To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, a good resource is your certified Regional Poison-Control Center. Telephone numbers of certified poison-control centers are listed in the Physicians’ Desk Reference** (PDR). In managing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, consider the possibilities of multiple-drug <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span>, drug-drug interactions, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient.</p>
<p>      The most likely effect of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> with Lotrel is vasodilation, with consequent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>. Simple repletion of central fluid volume (Trendelenburg positioning, infusion of crystalloids) may be sufficient therapy, but pressor agents (norepinephrine or high-dose dopamine) may be required. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">Overdoses</span> of other dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are reported to have been treated with calcium chloride and glucagon, but evidence of a dose-response relation has not been seen, and these interventions must be regarded as unproven. With abrupt return of peripheral vascular tone, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> of other dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers have sometimes progressed to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4078925" conceptname="Pulmonary edema">pulmonary edema</span>, and patients must be monitored for this complication.</p>
<p>      Analyses of bodily fluids for concentrations of amlodipine, benazepril, or their metabolites are not widely available. Such analyses are, in any event, not known to be of value in therapy or prognosis.</p>
<p>      No data are available to suggest physiologic maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of amlodipine, benazepril, or their metabolites. Benazeprilat is only slightly dialyzable; attempted clearance of amlodipine by hemodialysis or hemo-perfusion has not been reported, but amlodipine’s high protein binding makes it unlikely that these interventions will be of value.</p>
<p>      Angiotensin II could presumably serve as a specific antagonist-antidote to benazepril, but angiotensin II is essentially unavailable outside of scattered research laboratories.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span></h1>
<p class="First">Amlodipine is an effective treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> in once-daily doses of 2.5-10 mg while benazepril is effective in doses of 10-80 mg. In clinical trials of amlodipine/benazepril combination therapy using amlodipine doses of 2.5-10 mg and benazepril doses of 10-40 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing dose of amlodipine in all patient groups, and the effects increased with increasing dose of benazepril in nonblack groups. All patient groups benefited from the reduction in amlodipine-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span> (see below).</p>
<p>      The hazards (see WARNINGS) of benazepril are generally independent of dose; those of amlodipine are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4094513" conceptname="Ankle edema">peripheral edema</span>) and dose-independent phenomena, the former much more common than the latter. When benazepril is added to a regimen of amlodipine, the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span> is substantially reduced. Therapy with any combination of amlodipine and benazepril will thus be associated with both sets of dose-independent hazards, but the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span> will generally be less than that seen with similar (or higher) doses of amlodipine monotherapy.</p>
<p>      Rarely, the dose-independent hazards of benazepril are serious. To minimize dose-independent hazards, it is usually appropriate to begin therapy with Lotrel only after a patient has either (a) failed to achieve the desired antihypertensive effect with one or the other monotherapy, or (b) demonstrated inability to achieve adequate antihypertensive effect with amlodipine therapy without developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Dose Titration Guided by Clinical Effect:</span> A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with amlodipine (or another dihydropyridine) alone or with benazepril (or another ACE inhibitor) alone may be switched to combination therapy with Lotrel. The addition of benazepril to a regimen of amlodipine should not be expected to provide additional antihypertensive effect in African-Americans. However, all patient groups benefit from the reduction in amlodipine-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span>. Dosage must be guided by clinical response; steady-state levels of benazepril and amlodipine will be reached after approximately 2 and 7 days of dosing, respectively.</p>
<p>      In patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with amlodipine but who experience unacceptable <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span>, combination therapy may achieve similar (or better) blood pressure control without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span>. Especially in nonblacks, it may be prudent to minimize the risk of excessive response by reducing the dose of amlodipine as benazepril is added to the regimen.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Replacement Therapy:</span> For convenience, patients receiving amlodipine and benazepril from separate tablets may instead wish to receive capsules of Lotrel containing the same component doses.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Use in Patients With Metabolic Impairments:</span> Regimens of therapy with Lotrel need not take account of renal function as long as the patient’s creatinine clearance is &gt;30 mL/min/1.73m<span class="Sup">2</span> (serum creatinine roughly ≤3 mg/dL or 265 µmol/L). In patients with more severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, the recommended initial dose of benazepril is 5 mg. Lotrel is not recommended in these patients.</p>
<p>      In small, elderly, frail, or hepatically impaired patients, the recommended initial dose of amlodipine, as monotherapy or as a component of combination therapy, is 2.5 mg.</p>

<p>Read this Patient Information leaflet before you start taking LOTREL and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This leaflet does not replace talking with your doctor. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What is the most important information I should know about LOTREL?</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">LOTREL can harm an unborn baby and even cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. If you get pregnant, stop taking LOTREL. Call your doctor right away.</span> Talk to your doctor about other ways to lower your blood pressure if you plan to become pregnant.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What is LOTREL?</span></p>
<p>LOTREL contains two prescription medicines that work together to lower blood pressure: amlodipine besylate (the active ingredient found in Norvasc<span class="Sup">®</span>), a calcium channel blocker, and benazepril hydrochloride (Lotensin®), an ACE inhibitor. Your doctor will prescribe LOTREL only after other medicines haven’t worked.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">High Blood Pressure (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span></span>). Blood pressure is the force of blood in your blood vessels. You have high blood pressure when the force is too much. LOTREL can help your blood vessels relax so your blood pressure is lower.</p>
<p>LOTREL has not been studied in children.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Who should not take LOTREL?</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Don’t take LOTREL if you are allergic to any of the ingredients.</span> There is a complete list at the end of this leaflet.</p>

Ask your doctor if you are not sure.</p>
