Analyses of seventeen placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10 week controlled trial, the rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> were varied, most of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4132309" conceptname="Sudden death">sudden death</span>) or infectious (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255848" conceptname="Pneumonia">pneumonia</span>) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear.

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">Tardive Dyskinesia</span></h2>
<p class="First"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">Tardive dyskinesia</span>, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> is unknown.</p>
<p>Both the risk of developing the syndrome and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.</p>
<p>There is no known treatment for established cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying disease process.</p>
<p>The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.</p>
<p>Given these considerations, antipsychotics should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> especially in the elderly. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that, 1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and, 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are <span class="Italics">not</span> available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.</p>
<p>If signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> appear in a patient on antipsychotics, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment despite the presence of the syndrome.</p>
<p>For further information about the description of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> and its clinical detection, please refer to the sections on <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span> and <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="379802" conceptname="Neuroleptic malignant syndrome">Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome</span> (NMS)</h2>
<p class="First">A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="379802" conceptname="Neuroleptic malignant syndrome">Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome</span> (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260205" conceptname="Hyperpyrexia">hyperpyrexia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4050941" conceptname="Muscle rigidity">muscle rigidity</span>, altered mental status and evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434633" conceptname="Disorder of autonomic nervous system">autonomic instability</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4088122" conceptname="Heart irregular">irregular pulse</span> or blood pressure, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">diaphoresis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac dysrhythmias</span>).</p>
<p>The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255848" conceptname="Pneumonia">pneumonia</span>, systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4181404" conceptname="Heat stroke">heat stroke</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">drug fever</span> and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.</p>
<p>The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.</p>
<p>If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.</p>
<p>An encephalopathic syndrome (characterized by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">weakness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4061577" conceptname="Lethargy">lethargy</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremulousness</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373747" conceptname="Extrapyramidal disease">extrapyramidal symptoms</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438398" conceptname="Leukocytosis">leukocytosis</span>, elevated serum enzymes, BUN and FBS) has occurred in a few patients treated with lithium plus an antipsychotic. In some instances, the syndrome was followed by irreversible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4080670" conceptname="Brain damage">brain damage</span>. Because of a possible causal relationship between these events and the concomitant administration of lithium and antipsychotics, patients receiving such combined therapy should be monitored closely for early evidence of neurologic toxicity and treatment discontinued promptly if such signs appear. This encephalopathic syndrome may be similar to or the same as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="379802" conceptname="Neuroleptic malignant syndrome">neuroleptic malignant syndrome</span> (NMS).</p>
<p>Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4145241" conceptname="Bone marrow depression">bone marrow depression</span> or who have previously demonstrated a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reaction</span> (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="40528016" conceptname="Disorder of hematopoietic system">blood dyscrasias</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span>) with a phenothiazine should not receive any phenothiazine, including COMPAZINE<span class="Sup">®</span> (prochlorperazine maleate tablets USP), unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the possible hazards.</p>
<p>Prochlorperazine may impair mental and/or physical abilities, especially during the first few days of therapy. Therefore, caution patients about activities requiring alertness (e.g., operating vehicles or machinery).</p>
<p>Phenothiazines may intensify or prolong the action of central nervous system depressants (e.g., alcohol, anesthetics, narcotics).</p>

<h3>Non-teratogenic Effects</h3>
<p class="First">Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery.

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">The anti-emetic action of prochlorperazine may mask the signs and symptoms of overdosage of other drugs and may obscure the diagnosis and treatment of other conditions such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="193518" conceptname="Intestinal obstruction">intestinal obstruction</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4116092" conceptname="Intracranial tumor">brain tumor</span> and Reye’s syndrome (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p>
<p>When prochlorperazine is used with cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> as a sign of the toxicity of these agents may be obscured by the anti-emetic effect of prochlorperazine.</p>
<p>Because <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> may occur, large doses and parenteral administration should be used cautiously in patients with impaired cardiovascular systems. To minimize the occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> after injection, keep patient lying down and observe for at least ½ hour. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> occurs after parenteral or oral dosing, place patient in head-low position with legs raised. If a vasoconstrictor is required, Levophed<span class="Sup">®</span>* (norepinephrine bitartrate) and Neo-Synephrine<span class="Sup">®</span><span class="Sup">†</span> (phenylephrine hydrochloride) are suitable. Other pressor agents, including epinephrine, should not be used because they may cause a paradoxical further lowering of blood pressure.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">Aspiration</span> of vomitus has occurred in a few post-surgical patients who have received prochlorperazine as an anti-emetic. Although no causal relationship has been established, this possibility should be borne in mind during surgical aftercare.</p>
<p>Deep sleep, from which patients can be aroused, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span> have been reported, usually with overdosage.</p>
<p>Antipsychotic drugs elevate prolactin levels; the elevation persists during chronic administration. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately 1/3 of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>, a factor of potential importance if the prescribing of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with a previously detected breast cancer. Although disturbances such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79884" conceptname="Galactorrhea not associated with childbirth">galactorrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443800" conceptname="Amenorrhea">amenorrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168447" conceptname="Gynecomastia">gynecomastia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">impotence</span> have been reported, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. An increase in mammary neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of antipsychotic drugs. Neither clinical nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date, however, have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis; the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time.</p>
<p>Chromosomal aberrations in spermatocytes and abnormal sperm have been demonstrated in rodents treated with certain antipsychotics.</p>
<p>As with all drugs which exert an anticholinergic effect, and/or cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4290615" conceptname="Dilated pupil">mydriasis</span>, prochlorperazine should be used with caution in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437541" conceptname="Glaucoma">glaucoma</span>.</p>
<p>Because phenothiazines may interfere with thermoregulatory mechanisms, use with caution in persons who will be exposed to extreme heat.</p>
<p>Phenothiazines can diminish the effect of oral anticoagulants.</p>
<p>Phenothiazines can produce alpha-adrenergic blockade.</p>
<p>Thiazide diuretics may accentuate the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span> that may occur with phenothiazines.</p>
<p>Antihypertensive effects of guanethidine and related compounds may be counteracted when phenothiazines are used concomitantly.</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of propranolol with phenothiazines results in increased plasma levels of both drugs.</p>
<p>Phenothiazines may lower the convulsive threshold; dosage adjustments of anticonvulsants may be necessary. Potentiation of anticonvulsant effects does not occur. However, it has been reported that phenothiazines may interfere with the metabolism of Dilantin<span class="Sup">®</span><span class="Sup">‡</span> (phenytoin) and thus precipitate Dilantin (phenytoin) toxicity.</p>

<h2>Long-Term Therapy</h2>
<p class="First">Given the likelihood that some patients exposed chronically to antipsychotics will develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>, it is advised that all patients in whom chronic use is contemplated be given, if possible, full information about this risk. The decision to inform patients and/or their guardians must obviously take into account the clinical circumstances and the competency of the patient to understand the information provided.</p>
<p>To lessen the likelihood of adverse reactions related to cumulative drug effect, patients with a history of long-term therapy with prochlorperazine and/or other antipsychotics should be evaluated periodically to decide whether the maintenance dosage could be lowered or drug therapy discontinued.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Children with acute illnesses (e.g., chicken-pox, CNS <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030555" conceptname="Measles">measles</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4101468" conceptname="Gastroenteritis">gastroenteritis</span>) or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435796" conceptname="Dehydration">dehydration</span> seem to be much more susceptible to neuromuscular reactions, particularly <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375800" conceptname="Dystonia">dystonias</span>, than are adults.

<p>Drugs which lower the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> threshold, including phenothiazine derivatives, should not be used with Amipaque<span class="Sup">®</span><span class="Sup">§</span> (metrizamide). As with other phenothiazine derivatives, prochlorperazine should be discontinued at least 48 hours before myelography, should not be resumed for at least 24 hours postprocedure, and should not be used for the control of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> occurring either prior to myelography with Amipaque (metrizamide), or postprocedure.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of prochlorperazine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects. Geriatric patients are more sensitive to the side effects of antipsychotics, including prochlorperazine. These adverse events include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, anticholinergic effects (such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192450" conceptname="Retention of urine">urinary retention</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">constipation</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>), and neuromuscular reactions (such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4140090" conceptname="Parkinsonism">parkinsonism</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>) (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span> and <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>). Also, postmarketing safety experience suggests that the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440689" conceptname="Agranulocytosis">agranulocytosis</span> may be higher in geriatric patients compared to younger individuals who received prochlorperazine. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p>

<h2>Extrapyramidal Reactions</h2>
<p class="First">These symptoms are seen in a significant number of hospitalized mental patients.

<p>Depending on the severity of symptoms, dosage should be reduced or discontinued. If therapy is reinstituted, it should be at a lower dosage. Should these symptoms occur in children or pregnant patients, the drug should be stopped and not reinstituted. In most cases barbiturates by suitable route of administration will suffice. (Or, injectable Benadryl<span class="Sup">®</span><span class="Sup">#</span> [diphenhydramine] may be useful.) In more severe cases, the administration of an anti-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4140090" conceptname="Parkinsonism">parkinsonism</span> agent, except levodopa (see <span class="Italics">PDR</span>), usually produces rapid reversal of symptoms.

Dosage should not be increased until these side effects have subsided.</p>
<p>If these symptoms become too troublesome, they can usually be controlled by a reduction of dosage or change of drug. Treatment with anti-parkinsonian agents, benzodiazepines or propranolol may be helpful.</p>

<h3><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">Tardive Dyskinesia</span></h3>
<p class="First">As with all antipsychotic agents, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> may appear in some patients on long-term therapy or may appear after drug therapy has been discontinued. The syndrome can also develop, although much less frequently, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. This syndrome appears in all age groups. Although its prevalence appears to be highest among elderly patients, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict at the inception of antipsychotic treatment which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. The symptoms are persistent and in some patients appear to be irreversible. The syndrome is characterized by rhythmical involuntary movements of the tongue, face, mouth or jaw (e.g., protrusion of tongue, puffing of cheeks, puckering of mouth, chewing movements). Sometimes these may be accompanied by involuntary movements of extremities. In rare instances, these involuntary movements of the extremities are the only manifestations of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>. A variant of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>, tardive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375800" conceptname="Dystonia">dystonia</span>, has also been described.</p>
<p>There is no known effective treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>; anti-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4140090" conceptname="Parkinsonism">parkinsonism</span> agents do not alleviate the symptoms of this syndrome. It is suggested that all antipsychotic agents be discontinued if these symptoms appear.</p>
<p>Should it be necessary to reinstitute treatment, or increase the dosage of the agent, or switch to a different antipsychotic agent, the syndrome may be masked.</p>
<p>It has been reported that fine vermicular movements of the tongue may be an early sign of the syndrome and if the medication is stopped at that time the syndrome may not develop.</p>

<h3>Adverse Reactions Reported With Prochlorperazine or Other Phenothiazine Derivatives</h3>
<p class="First">Adverse reactions with different phenothiazines vary in type, frequency and mechanism of occurrence, i.e., some are dose-related, while others involve individual patient sensitivity.

<h2>Treatment</h2>
<p class="First">It is important to determine other medications taken by the patient since multiple-dose therapy is common in overdosage situations. Treatment is essentially symptomatic and supportive. Early gastric lavage is helpful. Keep patient under observation and maintain an open airway, since involvement of the extrapyramidal mechanism may produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31317" conceptname="Dysphagia">dysphagia</span> and respiratory difficulty in severe overdosage. <span class="Bold">Do not attempt to induce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> because a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375800" conceptname="Dystonia">dystonic reaction</span> of the head or neck may develop that could result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span> of vomitus.</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373747" conceptname="Extrapyramidal disease">Extrapyramidal symptoms</span> may be treated with anti-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4140090" conceptname="Parkinsonism">parkinsonism</span> drugs, barbiturates or Benadryl (diphenhydramine). See prescribing information for these products. Care should be taken to avoid increasing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>.</p>
<p>If administration of a stimulant is desirable, amphetamine, dextroamphetamine or caffeine with sodium benzoate is recommended.</p>
<p>Stimulants that may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> (e.g., picrotoxin or pentylenetetrazol) should be avoided.</p>
<p>If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> occurs, the standard measures for managing circulatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span> should be initiated. If it is desirable to administer a vasoconstrictor, Levophed (norepinephrine bitartrate) and Neo-Synephrine (phenylephrine hydrochloride) are most suitable. Other pressor agents, including epinephrine, are not recommended because phenothiazine derivatives may reverse the usual elevating action of these agents and cause a further lowering of blood pressure.</p>
<p>Limited experience indicates that phenothiazines are not dialyzable.</p>
