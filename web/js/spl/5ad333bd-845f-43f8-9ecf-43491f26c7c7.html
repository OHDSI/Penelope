<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Methoxsalen is a naturally occurring photoactive substance found in the seeds of the Ammi majus (Umbelliferae) plant. It belongs to a group of compounds known as psoralens or furocoumarins. The chemical name of methoxsalen is 9-methoxy-7H-furo[3,2-g][1]-benzopyran-7-one; it has the following structure:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="Chemical Structure" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=5ad333bd-845f-43f8-9ecf-43491f26c7c7&amp;name=uvadex-01.jpg"></div>
<p>Each mL of UVADEX<span class="Sup">®</span> (methoxsalen, 8-methoxypsoralen) Sterile Solution contains methoxsalen 20 mcg, propylene glycol 50 mg, sodium chloride 8 mg, sodium acetate 1.75 mg, ethanol 40.550 mg, glacial acetic acid 1.260 mg, and Water for Injection q.s. to 1.0 mL. Glacial acetic acid and sodium hydroxide are used to adjust the pH of the solution if necessary. UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span></span> is a clear, colorless to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260836" conceptname="Blanching of skin">pale</span> yellow liquid.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>

<a name="section-3.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Mechanism of action</h2>
<p class="First">The exact mechanism of action of methoxsalen is not known. The best-known biochemical reaction of methoxsalen is with DNA. Methoxsalen, upon photoactivation, conjugates and forms covalent bonds with DNA which leads to the formation of both monofunctional (addition to a single strand of DNA) and bifunctional adducts (crosslinking of psoralen to both strands of DNA). Reactions with proteins have also been described. The formation of photoadducts results in inhibition of DNA synthesis, cell division and epidermal turnover.  </p>
<p>For the palliative treatment of Cutaneous T-Cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">Lymphoma</span>, Photopheresis consists of removing a portion of the patient's blood and separating the red blood cells from the white cell layer (buffy coat) by centrifugation. The red cells are returned to the patient and the UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> Sterile Solution is then injected into the instrument and mixed with the buffy coat. The instrument then irradiates this drug-cell mixture with ultraviolet light (UVA light, 320-400 nm) and returns the treated cells to the patient. See the appropriate Operator's Manual for details of this process. Although extracorporeal phototherapy exposes less than 10% of the total body burden of malignant cells to methoxsalen plus light, some patients achieve a complete response. Animal studies suggest that the photopheresis may activate an immune-mediated response against the malignant T-cells.</p>
<p>Use of the UVAR and UVAR XTS<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> Systems after oral administration of methoxsalen were previously approved for the treatment of Cutaneous T-Cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">Lymphoma</span>. Interpatient variability in peak plasma concentration after an oral dose of methoxsalen ranges from 6 to 15 fold. UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> is injected directly into the separated buffy coat in the instrument in an attempt to diminish this interpatient variability and to improve the exposure of the cells to the drug.</p>
<p>Methoxsalen is reversibly bound to serum albumin and is also preferentially taken up by epidermal cells. Methoxsalen is rapidly metabolized in humans, with approximately 95% of the drug excreted as metabolites in the urine within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Systemic administration of methoxsalen followed by UVA exposure leads to cell injury. The most obvious manifestation of this injury after skin exposure is delayed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span>, which may not begin for several hours and peaks at 48-72 hours. The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> is followed over several days to weeks, by repair which is manifested by increased melanization of the epidermis and thickening of the stratum corneum.</p>
<p>The total dose of methoxsalen delivered in UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> is substantially lower (approximately 200 times) than that used with oral administration. More than 80% of blood samples collected 30 minutes after reinfusion of the photoactivated buffy coat had methoxsalen levels below detection limits of the assay (&lt;10 ng/ml), and the mean plasma methoxsalen concentration was approximately 25 ng/ml. </p>

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First">Three single-arm studies were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of photopheresis in the treatment of the skin manifestations of Cutaneous T-Cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">Lymphoma</span> (CTCL). In the first study (CTCL 1), 39 patients were treated with the oral formulation of methoxsalen in conjunction with the UVAR Photopheresis System. The second study (CTCL 2) was a 5-year post approval follow-up of 57 CTCL patients that was conducted to evaluate long-term safety. This study also used the oral dosage formulation of methoxsalen. In the third study (CTCL 3), 51 patients were treated with the UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> formulation of methoxsalen in conjunction with the UVAR Photopheresis System. In study CTCL 3, 86% of the patients were Caucasian, the median age was 62 years, and the average number of prior therapies was 4.3</p>
<p>In study CTCL 1, prednisone up to 10 mg/day was permitted in addition to topical steroids. In CTCL 2, there was no concomitant medication restriction. In CTCL 3, topical steroids were permitted only for the treatment of fissures on the soles of the feet and the palms of hands. All other steroids, topical or systemic, were prohibited.</p>
<p>In all three studies, patients were initially treated on two consecutive days every four to five weeks. If the patient did not respond after four cycles, treatment was accelerated to two consecutive days every other week. If the patient did not respond after four cycles at the accelerated schedule, the patient was treated on two consecutive days every week. If the patient still did not respond after four cycles of weekly treatments, the schedule was increased to three consecutive days every week for three cycles. In study CTCL 3, 15 of the 17 responses were seen within six months of treatment. Only two patients responded to treatment after six months. Clinical experience does not extend beyond this treatment frequency and there is no evidence to show that treatment with UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> beyond six months or using a different schedule provided additional benefit.</p>
<p>Overall skin scores were used in the clinical studies of photopheresis to assess the patient's response to treatment. The patient's baseline skin score was used for comparison with subsequent scores. A 25% reduction in skin score maintained for four consecutive weeks was considered a successful response to photopheresis therapy. Table 1 indicates the percent of successful responses within six months of beginning therapy for all patients who received at least one course of photopheresis. Only patients with patch plaque, extensive plaque and erythrodermic disease were enrolled in these studies. No patients with disease in the tumor phase were treated. There are no data available regarding the efficacy of UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> in patients with disease in the tumor phase.</p>

</table>
<p>Although the response rate with UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> in CTCL 3 was similar to with oral methoxsalen in CTCL 2, the possibility that UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> is inferior in efficacy to oral methoxsalen cannot be excluded due to the design and size of the clinical trials. The higher response rate with oral methoxsalen in CTCL 1 may be partly due to patients receiving more treatments (mean of 64 in CTCL 1, 31 in CTCL 2, and 20 in CTCL 3), and to the administration of systemic steroids in CTCL 1.</p>
<p>Retrospective analyses of three clinical benefit parameters from the Body Area Severity Scores in CTCL 3 suggested a correlation between skin score response and improvement in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span>, scaling and resolution of fissures.</p>

<h2>Concomitant Therapy</h2>
<p class="First">Patients who are receiving concomitant therapy (either topically or systemically) with known photosensitizing agents such as anthralin, coal tar or coal tar derivatives, griseofulvin, phenothiazines, nalidixic acid, halogenated salicylanilides (bacteriostatic soaps), sulfonamides, tetracyclines, thiazides, and certain organic staining dyes such as methylene blue, toluidine blue, rose bengal and methyl orange may be at greater risk for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4080920" conceptname="Phytophotodermatitis">photosensitivity reactions</span> with UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span>.</p>

<a name="CARCINOGENESIS"></a><a name="section-7.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Carcinogenicity, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Oral administration of methoxsalen followed by cutaneous UVA exposure (PUVA therapy) is carcinogenic. In a prospective study of 1380 patients given PUVA therapy for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span>, 237 patients developed 1422 cutaneous squamous cell cancers. This observed incidence of cutaneous carcinoma is 17.6 times that expected for the general population. Previous cutaneous exposure to tar and UVB treatment, ionizing radiation or arsenic increased the risk of developing skin carcinomas after PUVA therapy. Because the dose of methoxsalen with UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> therapy is about 200 times less than with PUVA and the skin is not exposed to high cumulative doses of UVA light, the risk of developing skin cancer following UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> therapy may be lower.</p>
<p>Methoxsalen was carcinogenic in male rats that were given the drug by oral gavage five days per week for 103 weeks at doses of 37.5 and 75 mg/kg. The 37.5 mg/kg dose is about 1900 times greater than a single human methoxsalen dose during extracorporeal photopheresis treatment on a body surface area basis. The neoplastic lesions in rats included <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> and adenocarcinomas of the tubular epithelium of the kidneys, carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the Zymbal gland and alveolar or bronchiolar <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span>. Topical or intraperitoneal methoxsalen is a potent photo-carcinogen in albino mice and hairless mice.</p>
<p>With S9 activation, methoxsalen is mutagenic in the Ames test. In the absence of S9 activation and UV light, methoxsalen is clastogenic in vitro (sister chromatid exchange and chromosome aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells). Methoxsalen also causes DNA damage, interstrand cross-links and errors in DNA repair.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42228-7">
<a name="Pregnancy"></a><a name="section-7.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Pregnancy</h2>
<p class="First">Methoxsalen may cause fetal harm when given to a pregnant woman. Doses of 80 to 160 mg/kg/day given during organogenesis caused significant fetal toxicity in rats. The lowest of these doses, 80 mg/kg/day, is over 4000 times greater than a single dose of UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> on a mg/m2 basis. Fetal toxicity was associated with significant maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">anorexia</span> and increased relative liver weight. Signs of fetal toxicity included increased fetal mortality, increased resorptions, late <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079844" conceptname="Fetal death">fetal death</span>, fewer fetuses per litter, and decreased fetal weight. Methoxsalen caused an increase in skeletal malformation and variations at doses of 80 mg/kg/day and above. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of methoxsalen in pregnant women. If UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span>, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant.</p>

<h3><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">CATARACT</span> FORMATION</h3>
<p class="First">Exposure to large doses of UVA light causes <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">cataracts</span> in animals. Oral methoxsalen exacerbates this toxicity. The concentration of methoxsalen in the human lens is proportional to the concentration in serum. Serum methoxsalen concentrations are substantially lower after extracorporeal UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> treatment than after oral methoxsalen treatment. Nevertheless, if the lens is exposed to UVA light while methoxsalen is present, photoactivation of the drug may cause adducts to bind to biomolecules within the lens. If the lens is shielded from UVA light, the methoxsalen will diffuse out of the lens in about 24 hours.</p>
<p>Patients who use proper eye protection after PUVA therapy (oral methoxsalen) appear to have no increased risk of developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">cataracts</span>. The incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">cataracts</span> in these patients five years after their first treatment is about the same as that in the general population. Instruct patients emphatically to wear UVA absorbing, wrap-around sunglasses for twenty-four (24) hours after UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> treatment. They should wear these glasses any time they are exposed to direct or indirect sunlight, whether they are outdoors or exposed through a window.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Side effects of photopheresis (UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> used with the THERAKOS<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> Photopheresis System) were primarily related to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> secondary to changes in extracorporeal volume (&gt;1%). In study CTCL 3 (UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span>), six serious cardiovascular adverse experiences were reported in five patients (5/51, 10%). Five of these six events were not related to photopheresis and did not interfere with the scheduled photopheresis treatments. One patient (1/51, 2%) with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4124683" conceptname="Silent myocardial ischemia">ischemic heart disease</span> had an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span> after the first day of photopheresis that was resolved the next day. Six <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> were also reported in five patients. Two of the six events were Hickman catheter <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> in one patient, which did not interrupt the scheduled photopheresis. The other four <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> were not related to photopheresis and did not interfere with scheduled treatments.</p>

<h1>DRUG DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Each UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> treatment involves collection of leukocytes, photoactivation, and reinfusion of photoactivated cells. UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> (methoxsalen) Sterile Solution is supplied in 10 mL vials containing 200 mcg of methoxsalen (concentration of 20 mcg/mL). The THERAKOS<span class="Sup">®</span> UVAR XTS<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> or THERAKOS<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span>  CELLEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> Photopheresis System Operator's Manual should be consulted before using this product. UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> should not be diluted.  The contents of the vial should be injected into the THERAKOS<span class="Sup">®</span> UVAR XTS<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> or THERAKOS<span class="Sup">®</span> CELLEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> Photopheresis System immediately after being drawn up into a syringe.  Do not inject directly into patients. The UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> vial is for single use only.  Any UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> that is not used during a procedure should be immediately discarded.  UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> can adsorb onto PVC and plastics, therefore only THERAKOS<span class="Sup">®</span> UVAR XTS<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> or THERAKOS<span class="Sup">®</span> CELLEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> photopheresis procedural kits supplied for use with the instrument should be used to administer this medicinal product.  Once UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> is drawn into a plastic syringe it should be immediately injected into the photoactivation bag.  UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> exposed to a plastic syringe for more than one hour should be discarded.</p>
<p>During treatment with the THERAKOS<span class="Sup">®</span> UVAR XTS<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> or THERAKOS<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> CELLEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> Photopheresis System, the dosage of UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> for each treatment will be calculated according to the treatment volume.  </p>
<ul class="Disc"><li>The prescribed amount of UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> should be injected into the recirculation bag prior to the Photactivation Phase using the formula:<br><br><dl>
<dt> </dt>
<dd>TREATMENT VOLUME X 0.017 = mL of UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> for each treatment<br><br>
</dd>

<dd>Example: Treatment volume of 240 mL X 0.017 = 4.1 mL of UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span>

<h2>Frequency/Schedule of Treatment</h2>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-11.1.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Normal Treatment Schedule</h3>
<p class="First">Treatment is given on two consecutive days every four weeks for a minimum of seven treatment cycles (six months).</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-11.1.2"></a><p></p>
<h3>Accelerated Treatment Schedule</h3>
<p class="First">If the assessment of the patient during the fourth treatment cycle (approximately three months) reveals an increased skin score from the baseline score, the frequency of treatment may be increased to two consecutive treatments every two weeks. If a 25% improvement in the skin score is attained after four consecutive weeks, the regular treatment schedule may resume. Patients who are maintained in the accelerated treatment schedule may receive a maximum of 20 cycles. There is no clinical evidence to show that treatment with UVADEX<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> beyond six months or using a different schedule provides additional benefit. In study CTCL 3, 15 of the 17 responses were seen within six months of treatment and only two patients responded to treatment after six months.</p>
