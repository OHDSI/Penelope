<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Cilostazol is a quinolinone derivative that inhibits cellular phosphodiesterase (more specific for phosphodiesterase III). The empirical formula of cilostazol is C<span class="Sub">20</span>H<span class="Sub">27</span>N<span class="Sub">5</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span>, and its molecular weight is 369.47. Cilostazol is 6-[4-(1-cyclohexyl-1<span class="Italics">H</span>-tetrazol-5-yl)butoxy]-3,4-dihydro-2(1<span class="Italics">H</span>)-quinolinone, CAS-73963-72-1.</p>
<p>The structural formula is:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="Chemical Structure - Cilostazol" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=20a05739-46a6-47ca-ae61-4341d028460e&amp;name=d801230d-0344-4cea-bb04-5818e931bb66-01.jpg"></div>
<p>Cilostazol occurs as white to off-white crystals or as a crystalline powder that is slightly soluble in methanol and ethanol, and is practically insoluble in water, 0.1 N HCl, and 0.1 N NaOH.</p>
<p>Cilostazol tablets for oral administration are available in 50 mg and 100 mg round, white tablets. Each tablet, in addition to the active ingredient, contains the following inactive ingredients: corn starch, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, and silicon dioxide.</p>

<h2>Mechanism of Action </h2>
<p class="First">The mechanism of the effects of cilostazol on the symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442774" conceptname="Intermittent claudication">intermittent claudication</span> is not fully understood. Cilostazol and several of its metabolites are cyclic AMP (cAMP) phosphodiesterase III inhibitors (PDE III inhibitors), inhibiting phosphodiesterase activity and suppressing cAMP degradation with a resultant increase in cAMP in platelets and blood vessels, leading to inhibition of platelet aggregation and vasodilation, respectively.</p>
<p>Cilostazol reversibly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by a variety of stimuli, including thrombin, ADP, collagen, arachidonic acid, epinephrine, and shear stress. Effects on circulating plasma lipids have been examined in patients taking cilostazol. After 12 weeks, as compared to placebo, cilostazol 100 mg b.i.d. produced a reduction in triglycerides of 29.3 mg/dL (15%) and an increase in HDL-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> of 4.0 mg/dL (<img alt="Symbol-approximately Equal" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=20a05739-46a6-47ca-ae61-4341d028460e&amp;name=d801230d-0344-4cea-bb04-5818e931bb66-02.jpg">10%).</p>

<h2>Cardiovascular Effects</h2>
<p class="First">Cilostazol affects both vascular beds and cardiovascular function. It produces non-homogeneous dilation of vascular beds, with greater dilation in femoral beds than in vertebral, carotid or superior mesenteric arteries. Renal arteries were not responsive to the effects of cilostazol.</p>
<p>In dogs or cynomolgous monkeys, cilostazol increased heart rate, myocardial contractile force, and coronary blood flow as well as ventricular automaticity, as would be expected for a PDE III inhibitor. Left ventricular contractility was increased at doses required to inhibit platelet aggregation. A-V conduction was accelerated. In humans, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="444070" conceptname="Tachycardia">heart rate increased</span> in a dose-proportional manner by a mean of 5.1 and 7.4 beats per minute in patients treated with 50 and 100 mg b.i.d., respectively. In 264 patients evaluated with Holter monitors, numerically more cilostazol-treated patients had increases in ventricular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316429" conceptname="Premature beats">premature beats</span> and non-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">sustained ventricular tachycardia</span> events than did placebo-treated patients; the increases were not dose-related.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics </h2>
<p class="First">Cilostazol is absorbed after oral administration. A high fat meal increases absorption, with an approximately 90% increase in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and a 25% increase in AUC. Absolute bioavailability is not known. Cilostazol is extensively metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 enzymes, mainly 3A4, and, to a lesser extent, 2C19, with metabolites largely excreted in urine. Two metabolites are active, with one metabolite appearing to account for at least 50% of the pharmacologic (PDE III inhibition) activity after administration of cilostazol. Pharmacokinetics are approximately dose proportional. Cilostazol and its active metabolites have apparent elimination half-lives of about 11-13 hours. Cilostazol and its active metabolites accumulate about 2-fold with chronic administration and reach steady state blood levels within a few days. The pharmacokinetics of cilostazol and its two major active metabolites were similar in healthy normal subjects and patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442774" conceptname="Intermittent claudication">intermittent claudication</span> due to peripheral arterial disease (PAD).</p>
<p>The mean ± SEM plasma concentration-time profile at steady state after multiple dosing of cilostazol 100 mg b.i.d. is shown below:</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Plasma Protein and Erythrocyte Binding </span></span></h3>
<p class="First">Cilostazol is 95% - 98% protein bound, predominantly to albumin. The mean percent binding for 3,4-dehydro-cilostazol is 97.4% and for 4´-trans-hydroxy-cilostazol is 66%. Mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> did not affect protein binding. The free fraction of cilostazol was 27% higher in subjects with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> than in normal volunteers. The displacement of cilostazol from plasma proteins by erythromycin, quinidine, warfarin, and omeprazole was not clinically significant.</p>

<h2>Metabolism and Excretion </h2>
<p class="First">Cilostazol is eliminated predominately by metabolism and subsequent urinary excretion of metabolites. Based on <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies, the primary isoenzymes involved in cilostazol’s metabolism are CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C19. The enzyme responsible for metabolism of 3,4-dehydro-cilostazol, the most active of the metabolites, is unknown.</p>
<p>Following oral administration of 100 mg radiolabeled cilostazol, 56% of the total analytes in plasma was cilostazol, 15% was 3,4-dehydro-cilostazol (4-7 times as active as cilostazol), and 4% was 4´-trans-hydroxy-cilostazol (one fifth as active as cilostazol). The primary route of elimination was via the urine (74%), with the remainder excreted in feces (20%). No measurable amount of unchanged cilostazol was excreted in the urine, and less than 2% of the dose was excreted as 3,4-dehydro-cilostazol. About 30% of the dose was excreted in the urine as 4´-trans-hydroxy-cilostazol. The remainder was excreted as other metabolites, none of which exceeded 5%. There was no evidence of induction of hepatic microenzymes.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic Impairment</span> </h2>
<p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of cilostazol and its metabolites were similar in subjects with mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span> as compared to healthy subjects.</p>
<p>Patients with moderate or severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> have not been studied.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal Impairment</span></h2>
<p class="First">The total pharmacologic activity of cilostazol and its metabolites was similar in subjects with mild to moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> and in normal subjects. Severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> increases metabolite levels and alters protein binding of the parent and metabolites. The expected pharmacologic activity, however, based on plasma concentrations and relative PDE III inhibiting potency of parent drug and metabolites, appeared little changed. Patients on dialysis have not been studied, but, it is unlikely that cilostazol can be removed efficiently by dialysis because of its high protein binding (95% - 98%).</p>

<h3><span class="Bold">Aspirin</span></h3>
<p class="First">Short term (≤4 days) coadministration of aspirin with cilostazol increased the inhibition of ADP-induced <span class="Italics">ex vivo</span> platelet aggregation by 22% - 37% when compared to either aspirin or cilostazol alone. Short term (≤4 days) coadministration of aspirin with cilostazol increased the inhibition of arachidonic acid-induced <span class="Italics">ex vivo</span> platelet aggregation by 20% compared to cilostazol alone and by 48% compared to aspirin alone. However, short-term coadministration of aspirin with cilostazol had no clinically significant impact on PT, aPTT, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4219104" conceptname="Bleeding time">bleeding time</span> compared to aspirin alone. Effects of long-term coadministration in the general population are unknown. In eight randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials, aspirin was coadministered with cilostazol to 201 patients. The most frequent doses and mean durations of aspirin therapy were 75-81 mg daily for 137 days (107 patients) and 325 mg daily for 54 days (85 patients). There was no apparent increase in incidence of hemorrhagic adverse effects in patients taking cilostazol and aspirin compared to patients taking placebo and equivalent doses of aspirin.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold">Warfarin </span></h3>
<p class="First">The cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes involved in the metabolism of R-warfarin are CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and CYP2C19, and in the metabolism of S-warfarin, CYP2C9. Cilostazol did not inhibit either the metabolism or the pharmacologic effects (PT, aPTT, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4219104" conceptname="Bleeding time">bleeding time</span>, or platelet aggregation) of R- and S-warfarin after a single 25 mg dose of warfarin.

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First">The ability of cilostazol to improve walking distance in patients with stable <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442774" conceptname="Intermittent claudication">intermittent claudication</span> was studied in eight large, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials of 12 to 24 weeks’ duration using dosages of 50 mg b.i.d. (n=303), 100 mg b.i.d. (n=998), and placebo (n=973). Efficacy was determined primarily by the change in maximal walking distance from baseline (compared to change on placebo) on one of several standardized exercise treadmill tests.</p>
<p>Compared to patients treated with placebo, patients treated with cilostazol 50 or 100 mg b.i.d. experienced statistically significant improvements in walking distances both for the distance before the onset of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442774" conceptname="Intermittent claudication">claudication</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> and the distance before exercise-limiting symptoms supervened (maximal walking distance). The effect of cilostazol on walking distance was seen as early as the first on-therapy observation point of two or four weeks.</p>
<p>The following figure depicts the percent mean improvement in maximal walking distance, at study end for each of the eight studies.</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="Figure 2" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=20a05739-46a6-47ca-ae61-4341d028460e&amp;name=d801230d-0344-4cea-bb04-5818e931bb66-04.jpg"></div>
<p>Across the eight clinical trials, the range of improvement in maximal walking distance in patients treated with cilostazol 100 mg b.i.d., expressed as the percent mean change from baseline, was 28% to 100%.</p>
<p>The corresponding changes in the placebo group were –10% to 41%.</p>
<p>The Walking Impairment Questionnaire, which was administered in six of the eight clinical trials, assesses the impact of a therapeutic intervention on walking ability. In a pooled analysis of the six trials, patients treated with either Cilostazol 100 mg b.i.d. or 50 mg b.i.d. reported improvements in their walking speed and walking distance as compared to placebo. Improvements in walking performance were seen in the various subpopulations evaluated, including those defined by gender, smoking status, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus, duration of peripheral artery disease, age, and concomitant use of beta blockers or of calcium channel blockers.

<h2>Information for Patients </h2>
<p class="First">Please refer to the patient package insert.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised: </p>
<ul>
<li>to read the patient package insert for cilostazol carefully before starting therapy and to reread it each time therapy is renewed in case the information has changed. </li>
<li>to take cilostazol at least one-half hour before or two hours after food.</li>
<li>that the beneficial effects of cilostazol on the symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442774" conceptname="Intermittent claudication">intermittent claudication</span> may not be immediate. Although the patient may experience benefit in 2 to 4 weeks after initiation of therapy, treatment for up to 12 weeks may be required before a beneficial effect is experienced.</li>

<h2>Drug Interactions </h2>
<p class="First">Since cilostazol is extensively metabolized by cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes, caution should be exercised when cilostazol is coadministered with inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as ketoconazole and erythromycin or inhibitors of CYP2C19 such as omeprazole. Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that omeprazole and erythromycin significantly increased the systemic exposure of cilostazol and/or its major metabolites. Population pharmacokinetic studies showed higher concentrations of cilostazol among patients concurrently treated with diltiazem, an inhibitor of CYP3A4 (see<a href="#i4i_section_id_6804d6b4-2f6b-4a88-8109-8dc70bac5dab">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY,</a><span class="Italics"><a href="#i4i_section_id_6804d6b4-2f6b-4a88-8109-8dc70bac5dab">Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Drug-Drug Interactions</a></span>). Cilostazol does not, however, appear to cause increased blood levels of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, as it had no effect on lovastatin, a drug with metabolism very sensitive to CYP3A4 inhibition.</p>

<h2>Use with other antiplatelet agents</h2>
<p class="First">Cilostazol inhibits platelet aggregation but in a reversible manner. Caution is advised in patients at risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> from surgery or pathologic processes. Platelet aggregability returns to normal within 96 hours of stopping cilostazol. Caution is advised in patients receiving both cilostazol and any other antiplatelet agent, or in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span>.</p>

<h2>Cardiovascular Toxicity </h2>
<p class="First">Repeated oral administration of cilostazol to dogs (30 or more mg/kg/day for 52 weeks, 150 or more mg/kg/day for 13 weeks, and 450 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks), produced cardiovascular lesions that included endocardial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">hemorrhage</span>, hemosiderin deposition and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012171" conceptname="Fibrosis">fibrosis</span> in the left ventricle, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">hemorrhage</span> in the right atrial wall, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">hemorrhage</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280654" conceptname="Necrosis">necrosis</span> of the smooth muscle in the wall of the coronary artery, intimal thickening of the coronary artery, and coronary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314659" conceptname="Arteritis">arteritis</span> and periarteritis. At the lowest dose associated with cardiovascular lesions in the 52-week study, systemic exposure (AUC) to unbound cilostazol was less than that seen in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 100 mg b.i.d. Similar lesions have been reported in dogs following the administration of other positive inotropic agents (including PDE III inhibitors) and/or vasodilating agents. No cardiovascular lesions were seen in rats following 5 or 13 weeks of administration of cilostazol at doses up to 1500 mg/kg/day. At this dose, systemic exposures (AUCs) to unbound cilostazol were only about 1.5 and 5 times (male and female rats, respectively) the exposure seen in humans at the MRHD. Cardiovascular lesions were also not seen in rats following 52 weeks of administration of cilostazol at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day. At this dose, systemic exposures (AUCs) to unbound cilostazol were about 0.5 and 5 times (male and female rats, respectively) the exposure in humans at the MRHD. In female rats, cilostazol AUCs were similar at 150 and 1500 mg/kg/day. Cardiovascular lesions were also not observed in monkeys after oral administration of cilostazol for 13 weeks at doses up to 1800 mg/kg/day. While this dose of cilostazol produced pharmacologic effects in monkeys, plasma cilostazol levels were less than those seen in humans given the MRHD, and those seen in dogs given doses associated with cardiovascular lesions.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility </h2>
<p class="First">Dietary administration of cilostazol to male and female rats and mice for up to 104 weeks, at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day in rats and 1000 mg/kg/day in mice, revealed no evidence of carcinogenic potential. The maximum doses administered in both rat and mouse studies were, on a systemic exposure basis, less than the human exposure at the MRHD of the drug. Cilostazol tested negative in bacterial gene mutation, bacterial DNA repair, mammalian cell gene mutation, and mouse <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> bone marrow chromosomal aberration assays. It was, however, associated with a significant increase in chromosomal aberrations in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell assay. </p>
<p>Cilostazol did not affect fertility or mating performance of male and female rats at doses as high as 1000 mg/kg/day. At this dose, systemic exposures (AUCs) to unbound cilostazol were less than 1.5 times in males, and about 5 times in females, the exposure in humans at the MRHD.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold">Pregnancy category C</span></h3>
<p class="First">In a rat developmental toxicity study, oral administration of 1000 mg cilostazol/kg/day was associated with decreased fetal weights, and increased incidences of cardiovascular, renal, and skeletal anomalies (ventricular septal, aortic arch and subclavian artery abnormalities, renal pelvic dilation, 14<span class="Sup">th</span> rib, and retarded ossification). At this dose, systemic exposure to unbound cilostazol in nonpregnant rats was about 5 times the exposure in humans given the MRHD. Increased incidences of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434462" conceptname="Ventricular septal defect">ventricular septal defect</span> and retarded ossification were also noted at 150 mg/kg/day (5 times the MRHD on a systemic exposure basis). In a rabbit developmental toxicity study, an increased incidence of retardation of ossification of the sternum was seen at doses as low as 150 mg/kg/day. In nonpregnant rabbits given 150 mg/kg/day, exposure to unbound cilostazol was considerably lower than that seen in humans given the MRHD, and exposure to 3,4-dehydro-cilostazol was barely detectable.</p>
<p>When cilostazol was administered to rats during late pregnancy and lactation, an increased incidence of stillborn and decreased birth weights of offspring was seen at doses of 150 mg/kg/day (5 times the MRHD on a systemic exposure basis).</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use </h2>
<p class="First">Of the total number of subjects (n = 2274) in clinical studies of cilostazol, 56 percent were 65-years-old and over, while 16 percent were 75-years-old and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Pharmacokinetic studies have not disclosed any age-related effects on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of cilostazol and its metabolites.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Adverse events were assessed in eight placebo-controlled clinical trials involving 2274 patients exposed to either 50 or 100 mg b.i.d. cilostazol (n=1301) or placebo (n=973), with a median treatment duration of 127 days for patients on cilostazol and 134 days for patients on placebo.</p>
<p>The only adverse event resulting in discontinuation of therapy in ≥ 3% of patients treated with cilostazol 50 or 100 mg b.i.d. was <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, which occurred with an incidence of 1.3%, 3.5%, and 0.3% in patients treated with cilostazol 50 mg b.i.d., 100 mg b.i.d, or placebo, respectively.

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Information on acute overdosage with cilostazol in humans is limited. The signs and symptoms of an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">acute overdose</span> can be anticipated to be those of excessive pharmacologic effect: severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, and possibly <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmias</span>. The patient should be carefully observed and given supportive treatment. Since cilostazol is highly protein-bound, it is unlikely that it can be efficiently removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. The oral LD<span class="Sub">50</span> of cilostazol is &gt;5.0 g/kg in mice and rats and &gt;2.0 g/kg in dogs.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">The recommended dosage of cilostazol is 100 mg b.i.d. taken at least half an hour before or two hours after breakfast and dinner. A dose of 50 mg b.i.d. should be considered during coadministration of such inhibitors of CYP3A4 as ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin and diltiazem, and during coadministration of such inhibitors of CYP2C19 as omeprazole. </p>
<p>Patients may respond as early as 2 to 4 weeks after the initiation of therapy, but treatment for up to 12 weeks may be needed before a beneficial effect is experienced.</p>
