<h2>5.1	Potential Risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">Myocardial Infarction</span> with Long-term Use</h2>
<p class="First">There were more reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarctions</span> in patients treated with alvimopan 0.5 mg twice daily compared with placebo-treated patients in a 12-month study of patients treated with opioids for chronic non-cancer <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> (alvimopan 0.5 mg, n = 538; placebo, n = 267). In this study, the majority of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarctions</span> occurred between 1 and 4 months after initiation of treatment. This imbalance has not been observed in other studies of ENTEREG in patients treated with opioids for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436096" conceptname="Chronic pain">chronic pain</span>, nor in patients treated within the surgical setting, including patients undergoing surgeries that included bowel resection who received ENTEREG 12 mg twice daily for up to 7 days (the indicated dose and patient population; ENTEREG 12 mg, n = 1,142; placebo, n = 1,120). A causal relationship with alvimopan with long-term use has not been established. </p>
<p>ENTEREG is available only through a program under a REMS that restricts use to enrolled hospitals <span class="Italics">[see<a href="#S5.2"> Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</a>].</span></p>

<h2>5.2	E.A.S.E. ENTEREG REMS Program</h2>
<p class="First">ENTEREG is available only through a program called the ENTEREG Access Support and Education (E.A.S.E.) ENTEREG REMS Program that restricts use to enrolled hospitals because of the potential risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> with long-term use of ENTEREG <span class="Italics">[see<a href="#S5.1"> Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</a>]. </span></p>
<p>Notable requirements of the E.A.S.E. Program include the following:</p>
<p>ENTEREG is available only for short-term (15 doses) use in hospitalized patients. Only hospitals that have enrolled in and met all of the requirements for the E.A.S.E. program may use ENTEREG. </p>
<p>To enroll in the E.A.S.E. Program, an authorized hospital representative must acknowledge that:</p>
<ul class="Disc">
<li>hospital staff who prescribe, dispense, or administer ENTEREG have been provided the educational materials on the need to limit use of ENTEREG to short-term, inpatient use;</li>
<li>patients will not receive more than 15 doses of ENTEREG; and</li>
<li>ENTEREG will not be dispensed to patients after they have been discharged from the hospital. </li>

<h2>5.3	Gastrointestinal-Related Adverse Reactions in Opioid-Tolerant Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Patients recently exposed to opioids are expected to be more sensitive to the effects of μ-opioid receptor antagonists, such as ENTEREG. Since ENTEREG acts peripherally, clinical signs and symptoms of increased sensitivity would be related to the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>). Patients receiving more than 3 doses of an opioid within the week prior to surgery were not studied in the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4340373" conceptname="Postoperative ileus">postoperative ileus</span> clinical trials. Therefore, if ENTEREG is administered to these patients, they should be monitored for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. ENTEREG is contraindicated in patients who have taken therapeutic doses of opioids for more than 7 consecutive days immediately prior to taking ENTEREG. </p>

<h2>5.4	Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Patients with Severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic Impairment</span></h2>
<p class="First">Patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> may be at higher risk of serious adverse reactions (including dose-related serious adverse reactions) because up to 10-fold higher plasma levels of drug have been observed in such patients compared with patients with normal hepatic function.

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="S6.1"></a><a name="section-6.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>6.1	Clinical Trials Experience</h2>
<p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be compared directly with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The adverse event information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. </p>
<p>The data described below reflect exposure to ENTEREG 12 mg in 1,793 patients in 10 placebo-controlled studies.

<h1>11	DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">ENTEREG capsules contain alvimopan, an opioid antagonist. Chemically, alvimopan is the single stereoisomer [[2(S)-[[4(<span class="Italics">R</span>)-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3(<span class="Italics">R</span>),4-dimethyl-1-piperidinyl]methyl]-1-oxo-3-phenylpropyl]amino]acetic acid dihydrate. It has the following structural formula:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="Chemical Structure" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=77a67dc6-35d3-48ff-9d18-292d4d442f70&amp;name=entereg-01.jpg"></div>
<p>Alvimopan is a white to light beige powder with a molecular weight of 460.6, and the empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">25</span>H<span class="Sub">32</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">4</span>∙2H<span class="Sub">2</span>O. It has a solubility of &lt;0.1 mg/mL in water or buffered solutions between pH 3.0 and 9.0, 1 to 5 mg/mL in buffered solutions at pH 1.2, and 10 to 25 mg/mL in aqueous 0.1 N sodium hydroxide. At physiological pH, alvimopan is zwitterionic, a property that contributes to its low solubility. </p>
<p>ENTEREG capsules for oral administration contain 12 mg of alvimopan on an anhydrous basis suspended in the inactive ingredient polyethylene glycol. </p>

<h2>12.1	Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Alvimopan is a selective antagonist of the cloned human μ-opioid receptor with a Ki of 0.4 nM (0.2 ng/mL) and no measurable opioid-agonist effects in standard pharmacologic assays. The dissociation of [<span class="Sup">3</span>H]-alvimopan from the human μ-opioid receptor is slower than that of other opioid ligands, consistent with its higher affinity for the receptor. At concentrations of 1 to 10 µM, alvimopan demonstrated no activity at any of over 70 non-opioid receptors, enzymes, and ion channels. </p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4340373" conceptname="Postoperative ileus">Postoperative ileus</span> is the impairment of gastrointestinal motility after intra-abdominal surgery or other, non-abdominal surgeries. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4340373" conceptname="Postoperative ileus">Postoperative ileus</span> affects all segments of the gastrointestinal tract and may last from 5 to 6 days, or even longer. This may potentially delay gastrointestinal recovery and hospital discharge until its resolution. It is characterized by abdominal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218984" conceptname="Abdominal distension">distention</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442597" conceptname="Swollen abdomen">bloating</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, accumulation of gas and fluids in the bowel, and delayed passage of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4091513" conceptname="Passing flatus">flatus</span> and defecation. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4340373" conceptname="Postoperative ileus">Postoperative ileus</span> is the result of a multifactorial process that includes inhibitory sympathetic input and release of hormones, neurotransmitters, and other mediators (e.g., endogenous opioids). A component of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4340373" conceptname="Postoperative ileus">postoperative ileus</span> also results from an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammatory reaction</span> and the effects of opioid analgesics. Morphine and other μ-opioid receptor agonists are universally used for the treatment of acute postsurgical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>; however, they are known to have an inhibitory effect on gastrointestinal motility and may prolong the duration of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4340373" conceptname="Postoperative ileus">postoperative ileus</span>. </p>
<p>Following oral administration, alvimopan antagonizes the peripheral effects of opioids on gastrointestinal motility and secretion by competitively binding to gastrointestinal tract μ-opioid receptors. The antagonism produced by alvimopan at opioid receptors is evident in isolated guinea pig ileum preparations in which alvimopan competitively antagonizes the effects of morphine on contractility. Alvimopan achieves this selective gastrointestinal opioid antagonism without reversing the central <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effects</span> of μ-opioid agonists. </p>

<h2>12.2	Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">In an exploratory study in healthy volunteers, alvimopan 12 mg administered twice a day reduced the delay in small and large bowel transit induced by codeine 30 mg administered 4 times a day, as measured by gastrointestinal scintigraphy. In the same study, concomitant alvimopan did not reduce the delay in gastric emptying induced by codeine. </p>
<p>In a study designed to evaluate potential effects on cardiac conduction, alvimopan did not cause clinically significant QTc prolongation at doses up to 24 mg twice daily (twice the approved dosage regimen) for 7 days. The potential for QTc effects at higher doses has not been studied. </p>

<h2>12.3	Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Following oral administration of alvimopan, an amide hydrolysis compound is present in the systemic circulation, which is considered a product exclusively of intestinal flora metabolism. This compound is referred to as the 'metabolite'. It is also a μ-opioid receptor antagonist with a Ki of 0.8 nM (0.3 ng/mL). </p>

<p class="First"><span class="Underline">Absorption:</span>  Following oral administration of ENTEREG capsules in healthy volunteers, plasma alvimopan concentration peaked at approximately 2 hours postdose. No significant accumulation in alvimopan concentration was observed following twice daily (BID) dosing. The mean peak plasma concentration was 10.98 (±6.43) ng/mL and mean AUC<span class="Sub">0–12h</span> was 40.2 (±22.5) ng∙h/mL after dosing of alvimopan at 12 mg BID for 5 days. The absolute bioavailability was estimated to be 6% (range, 1% to 19%). There was a delay in the appearance of the 'metabolite', which had a median T<span class="Sub">max</span> of 36 hours following administration of a single dose of alvimopan. Concentrations of the 'metabolite' were highly variable between subjects and within a subject. The 'metabolite' accumulated after multiple doses of ENTEREG. The mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> for the 'metabolite' after alvimopan 12 mg twice daily for 5 days was 35.73 ± 35.29 ng/mL. </p>
<p>Concentrations of alvimopan and its 'metabolite' are higher (~1.9-fold and ~1.4-fold, respectively) in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4340373" conceptname="Postoperative ileus">postoperative ileus</span> patients than in healthy volunteers. </p>

The C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC were decreased by approximately 38% and 21%, respectively, and the T<span class="Sub">max</span> was prolonged by approximately 1 hour. The clinical significance of this decreased bioavailability is unknown.

The average plasma clearance for alvimopan was 402 (±89) mL/min. Renal excretion accounted for approximately 35% of total clearance. There was no evidence that hepatic metabolism was a significant route for alvimopan elimination. Biliary secretion was considered the primary pathway for alvimopan elimination. Unabsorbed drug and unchanged alvimopan resulting from biliary excretion were then hydrolyzed to its 'metabolite' by gut microflora. The 'metabolite' was eliminated in the feces and in the urine as unchanged 'metabolite', the glucuronide conjugate of the 'metabolite', and other minor metabolites. The mean terminal phase half-life of alvimopan after multiple oral doses of ENTEREG ranged from 10 to 17 hours. The terminal half-life of the 'metabolite' ranged from 10 to 18 hours. </p>

<p>A population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that the pharmacokinetics of alvimopan were not affected by concomitant administration of acid blockers or antibiotics.

<h2>14.1	<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4340373" conceptname="Postoperative ileus">Postoperative Ileus</span></h2>
<p class="First">The efficacy of ENTEREG in the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4340373" conceptname="Postoperative ileus">postoperative ileus</span> was evaluated in 6 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled studies:  5 US studies (Studies 1-4 and 6) and 1 non–US study (Study 5). Patients 18 years of age or older undergoing partial large or small bowel resection surgery with primary anastomosis for colorectal or small bowel disease, total abdominal hysterectomy, or radical cystectomy for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="73153" conceptname="Malignant neoplasm of lateral wall of urinary bladder">bladder cancer</span> (in this procedure, resected segments of bowel are used for reconstruction of the urinary tract) under general anesthesia were randomly assigned to receive oral doses of ENTEREG 12 mg or matching placebo. The initial dose was administered at least 30 minutes and up to 5 hours prior to the scheduled start of surgery for most patients, and subsequent doses were administered twice daily beginning on the first postoperative day and continued until hospital discharge or a maximum of 7 days. There were no limitations on the type of general anesthesia used, but intrathecal or epidural opioids or anesthetics were prohibited.</p>
<p>All patients in the US studies were scheduled to receive intravenous patient-controlled opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>. In the non–US study, patients were scheduled to receive opioids either by intravenous patient-controlled opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> or bolus parenteral administration (intravenous or intramuscular). In all studies, there was no restriction on the type of opioid used or the duration of intravenous patient-controlled opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>. A standardized accelerated postoperative care pathway was implemented:  early nasogastric tube removal (before the first postoperative dose); early ambulation (day following surgery); early diet advancement (liquids offered the day following surgery for patients undergoing bowel resection and by the third day following surgery for patients undergoing radical cystectomy; solids by the second day following surgery for patients undergoing bowel resection and by the fourth day following surgery for patients undergoing radical cystectomy), as tolerated.</p>
<p>Patients who received more than 3 doses of an opioid (regardless of route) during the 7 days prior to surgery and patients with complete <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="193518" conceptname="Intestinal obstruction">bowel obstruction</span> or who were scheduled for a total colectomy, colostomy, or ileostomy were excluded. </p>
<p>The primary endpoint for all studies was time to achieve resolution of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4340373" conceptname="Postoperative ileus">postoperative ileus</span>, a clinically defined composite measure of both upper and lower gastrointestinal recovery. Although both 2-component (GI2: toleration of solid food and first bowel movement) and 3-component (GI3: toleration of solid food and either first <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4091513" conceptname="Passing flatus">flatus</span> or bowel movement) endpoints were used in all studies, GI2 is presented as it represents the most objective and clinically relevant measure of treatment response in patients undergoing surgeries that include a bowel resection. The time from the end of surgery to when the discharge order was written represented the length of hospital stay. In the 6 studies, 1,058 patients who underwent a surgery that included a bowel resection received placebo (not including 157 for total abdominal hysterectomy) and 1,096 patients received ENTEREG 12 mg (not including 143 for total abdominal hysterectomy). </p>
<p>The efficacy of ENTEREG following total abdominal hysterectomy has not been established. Therefore, the following data are presented only for surgeries that included a bowel resection (i.e., bowel resection or radical cystectomy). </p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-12.1.1"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Underline">Bowel Resection or Radical Cystectomy:</span>  A total of 2,154 patients underwent a surgery that included a bowel resection. The average age was 62 years, 54% were males, and 89% were Caucasian. The most common indications for surgery were colon or rectal cancer/malignancy, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="73153" conceptname="Malignant neoplasm of lateral wall of urinary bladder">bladder cancer</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4150051" conceptname="Diverticulum">diverticular disease</span>. In the non–US bowel resection study (Study 5), average daily postoperative opioid consumption was approximately 50% lower and the use of non-opioid analgesics substantially higher, as compared with the US bowel resection studies (Studies 1-4) for both treatment groups. During the first 48 hours postoperatively, the use of non-opioid analgesics was 69% compared with 4% for the non–US and US bowel resection studies, respectively. In each of the 6 studies, ENTEREG accelerated the time to recovery of gastrointestinal function, as measured by the composite endpoint GI2, and time to discharge order written as compared with placebo. Hazard ratios greater than 1 indicate a higher probability of achieving the event during the study period with treatment with ENTEREG than with placebo. <a href="#table1">Table 1 </a>provides the Hazard Ratios, Kaplan Meier means, medians, and mean and median treatment differences (hours) in gastrointestinal recovery between ENTEREG and placebo. </p>
