<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<span class="Bold"><span class="Bold"><span class="Underline"></span></span></span><div class="Figure"><img alt="MM1" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=957f79d9-2bcb-4e6b-885d-fa34851f062d&amp;name=MM1.jpg"></div>
<br><br>Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that exerts anxiolytic, sedative, muscle-relaxant, anticonvulsant and amnestic effects. Most of these effects are thought to result from a facilitation of the action of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.<br><br><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics<span class="Bold"><br></span></span><br>Absorption<br>After oral administration &gt;90% of diazepam is absorbed and the average time to achieve peak plasma concentrations is 1-1.5 hours with a range of 0.25 to 2.5 hours. Absorption is delayed and decreased when administered with a moderate fat meal. In the presence of food mean lag times are approximately 45 minutes as compared with 15 minutes when fasting. There is also an increase in the average time to achieve peak concentrations to about 2.5 hours in the presence of food as compared with 1.25 hours when fasting. This results in an average decrease in Cmax of 20% in addition to a 27% decrease in AUC (range 15% to 50%) when administered with food.<br><br>Distribution<br>Diazepam and its metabolites are highly bound to plasma proteins (diazepam 98%). Diazepam and its metabolites cross the blood-brain and placental barriers and are also found in breast milk in concentrations approximately one tenth of those in maternal plasma (days 3 to 9 post-partum). In young healthy males, the volume of distribution at steady-state is 0.8 to 1.0 L/kg. The decline in the plasma concentration-time profile after oral administration is biphasic. The initial distribution phase has a half-life of approximately 1 hour, although it may range up to &gt;3 hours.<br><br>Metabolism<br>Diazepam is N-demethylated by CYP3A4 and 2C19 to the active metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam, and is hydroxylated by CYP3A4 to the active metabolite temazepam. N-desmethyldiazepam and temazepam are both further metabolized to oxazepam. Temazepam and oxazepam are largely eliminated by glucuronidation.<br><br>Elimination<br>The initial distribution phase is followed by a prolonged terminal elimination phase (half-life up to 48 hours). The terminal elimination half-life of the active metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam is up to 100 hours. Diazepam and its metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine, predominantly as their glucuronide conjugates. The clearance of diazepam is 20 to 30 mL/min in young adults. Diazepam accumulates upon multiple dosing and there is some evidence that the terminal elimination half-life is slightly prolonged.<br><br><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations<span class="Bold"><br></span></span><br>Children<br>In children 3 - 8 years old the mean half-life of diazepam has been reported to be 18 hours.<br><br>Newborns<br>In full term infants, elimination half-lives around 30 hours have been reported, with a longer average half-life of 54 hours reported in premature infants of 28 - 34 weeks gestational age and 8 - 81 days post-partum. In both premature and full term infants the active metabolite desmethyldiazepam shows evidence of continued accumulation compared to children. Longer half-lives in infants may be due to incomplete maturation of metabolic pathways.<br><br>Geriatric<br>Elimination half-life increases by approximately 1 hour for each year of age beginning with a half-life of 20 hours at 20 years of age. This appears to be due to an increase in volume of distribution with age and a decrease in clearance. Consequently, the elderly may have lower peak concentrations, and on multiple dosing higher trough concentrations. It will also take longer to reach steady-state. Conflicting information has been published on changes of plasma protein binding in the elderly. Reported changes in free drug may be due to significant decreases in plasma proteins due to causes other than simply aging.<br><br><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">Hepatic Insufficiency</span><br>In mild and moderate cirrhosis, average half-life is increased. The average increase has been variously reported from 2-fold to 5-fold, with individual half-lives over 500 hours reported. There is also an increase in volume of distribution, and average clearance decreases by almost half. Mean half-life is also prolonged with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4267417" conceptname="Hepatic fibrosis">hepatic fibrosis</span> to 90 hours (range 66 - 104 hours), with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4026125" conceptname="Chronic active hepatitis">chronic active hepatitis</span> to 60 hours (range 26 - 76 hours), and with acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4291005" conceptname="Viral hepatitis">viral hepatitis</span> to 74 hours (range 49 - 129).

Abrupt withdrawal of Valium in such cases may also be associated with a temporary increase in the frequency and/or severity of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>.<br><br><span class="Bold">Pregnancy<span class="Bold"><br></span></span>An increased risk of congenital malformations and other developmental abnormalities associated with the use of benzodiazepine drugs during pregnancy has been suggested. There may also be non-teratogenic risks associated with the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy. There have been reports of neonatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">flaccidity</span>, respiratory and feeding difficulties, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435371" conceptname="Hypothermia">hypothermia</span> in children born to mothers who have been receiving benzodiazepines late in pregnancy. In addition, children born to mothers receiving benzodiazepines on a regular basis late in pregnancy may be at some risk of experiencing withdrawal symptoms during the postnatal period.<br>Diazepam has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and hamsters when given orally at daily doses of 100 mg/kg or greater (approximately eight times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD=1 mg/kg/day] or greater on a mg/m2 basis). <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135923" conceptname="Cleft palate">Cleft palate</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372887" conceptname="Disorder of brain">encephalopathy</span> are the most common and consistently reported malformations produced in these species by administration of high, maternally toxic doses of diazepam during organogenesis. Rodent studies have indicated that prenatal exposure to diazepam doses similar to those used clinically can produce long-term changes in cellular immune responses, brain neurochemistry, and behavior.<br>In general, the use of diazepam in women of childbearing potential, and more specifically during known pregnancy, should be considered only when the clinical situation warrants the risk to the fetus. The possibility that a woman of childbearing potential may be pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Patients should also be advised that if they become pregnant during therapy or intend to become pregnant they should communicate with their physician about the desirability of discontinuing the drug.<br><br><span class="Bold">Labor and Delivery<span class="Bold"><br></span></span>Special care must be taken when Valium is used during labor and delivery, as high single doses may produce irregularities in the fetal heart rate and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">hypotonia</span>, poor sucking, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435371" conceptname="Hypothermia">hypothermia</span>, and moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> in the neonates.

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<span class="Bold"><span class="Bold"><span class="Underline"></span></span></span><span class="Bold">General<span class="Bold"><br></span></span>If Valium is to be combined with other psychotropic agents or anticonvulsant drugs, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents to be employedparticularly with known compounds that may potentiate the action of diazepam, such as phenothiazines, narcotics, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors and other antidepressants (see<span class="Underline">Drug Interactions).<br></span>The usual precautions are indicated for severely depressed patients or those in whom there is any evidence of latent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, particularly the recognition that suicidal tendencies may be present and protective measures may be necessary.<br>Psychiatric and paradoxical reactions are known to occur when using benzodiazepines (see<span class="Underline">ADVERSE REACTIONS). Should this occur, use of the drug should be discontinued. These reactions are more likely to occur in children and the elderly.<br></span>A lower dose is recommended for patients with chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318459" conceptname="Respiratory insufficiency">respiratory insufficiency</span>, due to the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>.<br>Benzodiazepines should be used with extreme caution in patients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse (see<span class="Underline">DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span>).<br></span>In debilitated patients, it is recommended that the dosage be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude the development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437584" conceptname="Ataxia">ataxia</span> or oversedation (2 mg to 2.5 mg once or twice daily, initially, to be increased gradually as needed and tolerated).<br>Some loss of response to the effects of benzodiazepines may develop after repeated use of Valium for a prolonged time.<br><br><span class="Bold">Information For Patients<span class="Bold"><br></span></span>To assure the safe and effectiveuse of benzodiazepines, patients should be informed that, sincebenzodiazepines may produce psychological and physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>, it is advisable that they consult with their physician before either increasing the dose or abruptly discontinuing this drug. The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> increases with duration of treatment; it is also greater in patients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse.<br>Patients should be advised against the simultaneous ingestion of alcohol and other CNS-depressant drugs during Valium therapy. As is true of most CNS-acting drugs, patients receiving Valium should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle.<br><br><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions<span class="Bold"><br></span></span><br>Centrally Acting Agents<br>If Valium is to be combined with other centrally acting agents careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents employed particularly with compounds that may potentiate or be potentiated by the action of Valium, such as phenothiazines, antipsychotics, anxiolytics/sedatives, hypnotics, anticonvulsants, narcotic analgesics, anesthetics, sedative antihistamines, narcotics, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors and other antidepressants.<br><br>Alcohol<br>Concomitant use with alcohol is not recommended due to enhancement of the sedative effect.<br><br>Antacids<br>Diazepam peak concentrations are 30% lower when antacids are administered concurrently. However, there is no effect on the extent of absorption. The lower peak concentrations appear due to a slower rate of absorption, with the time required to achieve peak concentrations on average 20 - 25 minutes greater in the presence of antacids. However, this difference was not statistically significant.<br><br>Compounds Which Inhibit Certain Hepatic Enzymes<br>There is a potentially relevant interaction between diazepam and compounds which inhibit certain hepatic enzymes (particularly cytochrome P450 3A and 2C19). Data indicate that these compounds influence the pharmacokinetics of diazepam and may lead to increased and prolonged sedation. At present, this reaction is known to occur with cimetidine, ketoconazole, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, and omeprazole.<br><br>Phenytoin<br>There have also been reports that the metabolic elimination of phenytoin is decreased by diazepam.<br><br><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility<span class="Bold"><br></span></span>In studies in which mice and rats were administered diazepam in the diet at a dose of 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 6 and 12 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD=1 mg/kg/day] on a mg/m2 basis) for 80 and 104 weeks, respectively, an increased incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322895" conceptname="Nodule of liver">liver tumors</span> was observed in males of both species.

<h1>DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></h1>
<span class="Bold"><span class="Underline"></span></span>Diazepam is subject to Schedule IV control under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. Abuse and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> of benzodiazepines have been reported. Addiction-prone individuals (such as drug addicts or alcoholics) should be under careful surveillance when receiving diazepam or other psychotropic agents because of the predisposition of such patients to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4036424" conceptname="Drug tolerance">habituation</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>. Once physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> to benzodiazepines have developed, termination of treatment will be accompanied by withdrawal symptoms. The risk is more pronounced in patients on long-term therapy.<br>Withdrawal symptoms, similar in character to those noted with barbiturates and alcohol have occurred following abrupt discontinuance of diazepam.

The more severe withdrawal symptoms have usually been limited to those patients who had received excessive doses over an extended period of time.
