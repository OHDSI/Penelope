<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Torsemide Injection is a diuretic of the pyridine-sulfonylurea class. Its chemical name is 1-isopropyl-3-<br>[(4-rn-toluidino-3-pyridyl) sulfonyl]urea and its structural formula is:</p>
<br><p><img alt="Formula" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=f95454ab-33fa-483b-bba3-91d6562765c3&amp;name=Formula1.jpg"></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Its molecular formula is C16H2ON4O3S, its pKa is 6.42, and its molecular weight is 348.42.<br>Torsemide is a white to off-white crystalline powder. Torsemide vials for intravenous injection contain a<br>sterile solution of torsemide (10 mglmL), polyethylene g lycal-400, tromethamine, and sodium hydroxide<br>(as needed to adjust p H ) in water for injection.<br></p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Mechanism of Action<br>Micropuncture studies in anima ls have shown that torsemide acts from within the lumen of the thick<br>ascending portion of the loop of Henle, where it inhibits the Na'/K'/2CI'-carrier system. Clinical<br>pharmacology studies have confirmed this site of action in humans, and effects in other segments of<br>the nephron have not been demonstrated. Diuretic activity thus correlates better with the rate of drug<br>excretion in the urine than with the concentration in the blood.<br>Torsemide increases the urinary excretion of sodium, chloride, and water, but it does not significantly<br>alterglomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, or acid-base balance.<br><br>Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism<br>The volume of distribution of torsemide is 12 liters to 15 liters in normal adults or in patients with mild<br>to moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4064161" conceptname="Cirrhosis of liver">hepatic cirrhosis</span>, the volume of<br>distribution is approximately doubled.<br>In normal subjects the elimination half- life of torsemide is approximately 3.5 hours. Torsemide is cleared<br>from the circulation by both hepatic metabolism (approximately 80% of total clearance) and excretion<br>into the urine (approximately 20% of total clearance in patients w ith normal renal function). The major<br>metabolite in humans is the carboxylic acid derivative, which is biologically inactive. Two of the lesser<br>metabolites possess some diuretic activity, but for practical purposes metabolism terminates the action<br>of the drug.<br>Because torsemide is extensively bound to plasma protein (&gt; 990%), very little enters tubular urine via<br>glomerular filtration. Most renal clearance of torsemide occurs via active secretion of the drug by the<br>proximal tubules into tubular urine.<br>In patients with decompensated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>, hepatic and renal clearance are both reduced,<br>probably because of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4296301" conceptname="Hepatic congestion">hepatic congestion</span> and decreased renal plasma flow, respectively. The total<br>clearance of torsemide is approximately 50% of that seen in healthy volunteers, and the plasma half-life<br>and AUC are correspondingly increased. Because of reduced renal clearance, a smaller fraction of any<br>given dose is delivered to the intraluminal site of action, so at any given dose there is less natriuresis in<br>patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span> than in normal subjects.<br>In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span>, renal clearance of torsemide is markedly decreased but total plasma<br>clearance is not significantly altered. A smaller fraction of the administered dose is delivered to the<br>intraluminal site of action, and the natriuretic action of any given dose of diuretic is reduced. A diuretic<br>response in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> may still be achieved if patients are given higher doses. The total plasma<br>clearance and elimination half-life of torsemide remain normal under the conditions of impaired renal<br>function because metabolic elimination by the liver remains intact.<br>In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4064161" conceptname="Cirrhosis of liver">hepatic cirrhosis</span>, the volume of distribution, plasma half-life, and renal clearance are all<br>increased, but total clearance is unchanged.<br>The pharmacokinetic profile of torsemide in healthy elderly subjects is similar to that in young subjects<br>except for a decrease in renal clearance related to the decline in renal function that commonly occurs<br>with aging. However, total plasma clearance and elimination half-life remain unchanged.<br><br>Clinical Effects<br>The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuretic effect</span> s of torsemide begin within 10 minutes of intravenous dosing and peak within the first<br>hour.

However, because of the increased renal clearance of torsemide in<br>patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4064161" conceptname="Cirrhosis of liver">hepatic cirrhosis</span>, these factors tend to balance each other, and the result is an overall<br>natriuretic response that is similar to that seen in healthy subjects.

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">At the time of approval, torsemide had been evaluated for safety in approximately 4000 subjects: over<br>800 of these subjects received torsemide for at least 6 months, and over 380 were treated for more<br>than 1 year. Among these subjects were 564 who received torsemide during United States-based trials<br>in which 274 other subjects received placebo.<br>The reported side effects of torsemide were generally transient, and there was no relationship between<br>side effects and age, sex, race, or duration of therapy. Discontinuation of therapy due to side effects<br>occurred in 3.5% of United States patients treated with torsemide and in 4.4% of patients treated with<br>placebo. In studies conducted in the United States and Europe, discontinuation rates due to side effects<br>were 3% (38/1250) with torsemide and 3.4% (13/380) with furosemide in patients with congestive heart<br>failure, 2% (81409) with torsemide and 4.8% (11/230) with furosemide in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>,<br>and 7.6% (13/170) with torsemide and 0% (0/33) with furosemide in patients with cirrhosis.<br>The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with torsemide were (in descending order<br>of frequency) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">weakness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span>, excessive urination,<br><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4147761" conceptname="Hyperuricemia">hyperuricemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4241197" conceptname="Thirst">excessive thirst</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436375" conceptname="Hypovolemia">hypovolemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">impotence</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="23245" conceptname="Esophageal bleeding">esophageal hemorrhage</span>, and<br><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="23325" conceptname="Heartburn">dyspepsia</span>.
