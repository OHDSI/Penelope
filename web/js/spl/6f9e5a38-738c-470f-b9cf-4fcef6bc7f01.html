<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>Allergenic extracts are sterile solutions containing the extractables of the source material and components of the extraction fluid. Standardized Cat Hair is available as an extract from acetone precipitated source material in the extraction fluid described below. <br><span class="Bold">Source Material:</span><br>Cat Hair Source Material consists of hair clippings and/or shavings which have undergone an acetone precipitation process. APâ„¢ Acetone Precipitated Cat Hair is derived from the precipitate formed when acetone is added to an aqueous extract.<br><span class="Bold">Extracting Fluid:</span><br>Glycero-Cocaâ€™s: Contains 0.5% sodium chloride, 0.275% sodium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span>, and 50% glycerin (v/v) as a preservative.

<br><br><span class="Bold">Product Concentration:</span><br><span class="Bold">1. Bioequivalent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">Allergy</span> Units</span>. When originally licensed, standardized cat extracts containing 10 to 20 Fel d 1 units/mL were arbitrarily assigned 100,000 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">Allergy</span> Units (AU)/mL. Subsequently, quantitative skin testing by the ID<span class="Sub">50</span>EAL method <a href="#References">23</a> was used to determine that standardized cat extracts containing 10 to 19.9 Fel d 1 units/mL should be assigned 10,000 AU/mL rather than 100,000 AU/mL. To avoid possible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> about this change in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergy</span> unit assignment, the nomenclature changed for cat extracts, and such products are labeled in Bioequivalent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">Allergy</span> Units (BAU/mL). Each lot of Standardized Cat Hair extract is standardized by quantitating the Fel d 1 content based on standards on file with the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Test extracts are diffused in agar containing standard anti-serum to Fel d 1 and compared to the diffusion of a reference cat allergen preparation.<a href="#References">2</a> The potency of the extract is expressed as units of Fel d 1 per mL, and extracts containing 10-19.9 Fel d 1 units per mL are labeled at 10,000 BAU/mL. It has been recognized that there are differences in the levels of non Fel d 1 allergens among standardized cat extracts which utilize different source materials. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) patterns have been shown to be predictive of the presence of non Fel d 1 allergens. Therefore, each lot of Standardized Cat Hair is compared by IEF to a Cat Pelt Extract Reference and a Cat Hair Extract Reference on file with the CBER. The labeled name of the cat extract (i.e., Cat Hair Extract or Cat Pelt Extract) must be supported by matching the IEF profile of the corresponding reference.  <br><span class="Bold"><br>2. Concentrate.</span> Concentrate label terminology applies to allergenic extract mixtures where the individual allergens being combined vary in strength or the designation of strength. <br><a name="i6bb9450c-7c86-4558-8f7b-4efb3bdfa3bd"></a><table border="1" cellspacing="1" width="356"><tbody class="Headless">

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<a href="#References">13</a>  The mechanisms by which hyposensitization is achieved are not completely understood. It has been shown that repeated injections of appropriate allergenic extracts will ameliorate the intensity of allergic symptoms upon contact with the allergen.<a href="#References">6, 7, 8, 9</a>  Clinical studies which address the efficacy of immunotherapy are available. The allergens which have been studied are cat, mite, and some pollen extracts.<a href="#References">10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15</a><br>IgE antibodies bound to receptors on mast cell membranes are required for the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergic reaction</span>, and their level is probably related to serum IgE concentrations. Immunotherapy has been associated with decreased levels of IgE, and also with increases in allergen specific IgG â€œ blockingâ€? antibody. <br>The histamine release response of circulating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4172647" conceptname="Basophil count">basophils</span> to a specific allergen is reduced in some patients by immunotherapy, but the mechanism of this change is not yet clear. <br>The relationships among changes in blocking antibody, reaginic antibody, and mediator-releasing cells, and successful immunotherapy need study and clarification </div>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First"><a href="#References">3, 16, 17, 18</a>  Allergenic extracts are indicated for use in diagnosis and immunotherapy of patients presenting symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergy</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256439" conceptname="Allergic rhinitis due to pollen">hay fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4320791" conceptname="Rhinitis">rhinitis</span>, etc.) to specific environmental allergens. The selection of allergenic extracts to be used should be based on a thorough and carefully taken history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span>, and confirmed by skin testing.<a href="#References">19, 20</a><br>The use of mixed or unrelated antigens for skin testing is not recommended since, in the case of a positive reaction, it does not indicate which component of the mix is responsible for the reaction, while, in the case of a negative reaction, it fails to indicate whether the individual antigens at full concentration would give a positive reaction. Utilization of such mixes for compounding a treatment may result, in the former case, in administering unnecessary antigens and, in the latter case, in the omission of a needed allergen. <br>Avoidance of allergens is to be advocated if possible, but cannot always be attained, e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergy</span> to cat dander in kennel owners and employees, cat breeders, research workers, veterinarians, etc. <br>Allergens to which a patient is extremely sensitive should not be included in treatment mixes with allergens to which there is much less sensitivity, but should be administered separately. This allows individualized and better control of dosage increases, including adjustments in dosage becoming necessary after severe reactions which may occur to the highly reactive allergen.<br></p>

<a name="Contraindications"></a><a name="section-4"></a><p></p>
<h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h1>
<p class="First">There are no known absolute contraindications to immunotherapy. However, see <a href="#Precautions">PRECAUTIONS </a>for pregnancy risks.<br>Patients with cardiovascular diseases or pulmonary diseases such as symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>, and/or those who are receiving cardiovascular drugs such as beta blockers, may be at higher risk for severe adverse reactions. These patients may also be more refractory to the normal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergy</span> treatment regimen. Patients should be treated only if the benefit of treatment outweighs the risks.<a href="#References">1</a><br>Treat patients only with allergens to which they are allergic as shown by skin test reaction, have a history of symptoms on exposure to the allergen, and are likely to be exposed again. Any injections, including immunotherapy, should be avoided in patients with a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432585" conceptname="Blood coagulation disorder">bleeding tendency</span>. <br>Since there are differences of opinion concerning the possibility of routine immunizations exacerbating autoimmune diseases, immunotherapy should be given cautiously to patients with autoimmune diseases and only if the risk from exposure is greater than the risk of exacerbating the autoimmune process.<br></p>

<a name="Warnings"></a><a name="section-5"></a><p></p>
<h1>WARNINGS</h1> See <a href="#boxedwarnings"> WARNINGS </a>at the beginning of this instruction sheet. <br>Allergenic extract should be temporarily withheld from patients or the dose adjusted downward if any of the following conditions exist: (1) severe symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4320791" conceptname="Rhinitis">rhinitis</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>; (2) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> or flu accompanied by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>; or (3) exposure to excessive amounts of clinically relevant allergen prior to a scheduled injection. Do not start immunotherapy during a period of symptoms due to exposure. Since the individual components of the extract are those to which the patient is allergic, and to which he will be exposed, typical allergic symptoms may follow shortly after the injection, particularly when the antigen load from exposure plus the injected antigen exceeds the patientâ€™s antigen tolerance. <br>THE CONCENTRATE SHOULD NOT BE INJECTED AT ANY TIME UNLESS TOLERANCE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. DILUTE CONCENTRATED EXTRACTS WITH STERILE DILUENT FOR INTRADERMAL TESTING. INJECTIONS SHOULD NEVER BE GIVEN INTRAVENOUSLY. Subcutaneous injection is recommended. Intracutaneous or intramuscular injection may produce large local reactions or be excessively painful. AFTER INSERTING NEEDLE SUBCUTANEOUSLY, BUT BEFORE INJECTING, ALWAYS WITHDRAW THE PLUNGER SLIGHTLY. IF BLOOD APPEARS IN THE SYRINGE, CHANGE NEEDLE AND GIVE THE INJECTION IN ANOTHER SITE. <div class="Warning">

<span class="Bold">IF CHANGING FROM HAIR TO PELT EXTRACTS OR VICE-VERSA: Hair and pelt extracts differ in their non Fel d 1 allergens and are not interchangeable. Therefore, if patients are switched from one type of cat extract to another, the initial dose should be based on skin tests as noted under <a href="#references">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>, 3.

Initiate therapy as though patient had not been receiving immunotherapy, or determine initial dose by skin test using serial dilutions of the extract. See <a href="#precautions"> PRECAUTIONS </a>and <a href="#dosageandadministration"> DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a> Sections. <br>IF CHANGING TO A DIFFERENT LOT OF JUBILANT HOLLISTERSTIER EXTRACT: Even though it is the same formula and concentration, the first dose of the new extract should not exceed 50% of the last administered dose from the previous extract. <br>IF THE EXTRACT PREVIOUSLY USED WAS FROM ANOTHER MANUFACTURER: Since manufacturing processes and sources of raw materials differ among manufacturers, the interchangeability of extracts from different manufacturers cannot be insured. The starting dose of the extract therefore should be greatly decreased even though the extract is the same formula and dilution. Initiate therapy as though patient had not been receiving immunotherapy, or determine initial dose by skin test using serial dilutions of the extract. See <a href="#DosageandAdministration">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a> and <a href="#AdverseReactions">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a> Sections. <br>IF A PROLONGED PERIOD OF TIME HAS ELAPSED SINCE THE LAST INJECTION: Patients may lose tolerance for allergen injections during <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4088438" conceptname="Prolonged periods">prolonged periods</span> between doses. The duration of tolerance is an individual characteristic and varies from patient to patient. In general, the longer the lapse in the injection schedule, the greater dose reduction required. If the interval since last dose is over four weeks, perform skin tests to determine starting dose.  <br>IF THE PREVIOUS EXTRACT WAS OUTDATED: The dating period for allergenic extracts indicates the time that they can be expected to remain potent under refrigerated storage conditions (2Â° - 8Â° C). During the storage of extracts, even under ideal conditions, some loss of potency occurs. For this reason, extracts should not be used beyond their expiration date. If a patient has been receiving injections of an outdated extract, he may experience excessive local or systemic reactions when changed to a new, and possibly more potent, extract. In general, the longer the material has been outdated, the greater the dose reduction necessary for the fresh extract.<br>IF CHANGING FROM ALUM-ADSORBED TO AQUEOUS OR GLYCERINATED EXTRACTS: When the patient previously has been receiving alum-adsorbed or alum-precipitated extract, the safest course is to start over as though the patient had not been receiving immunotherapy.  See <a href="#dosageandaministration"> DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a> and <a href="#adversereactions"> ADVERSE REACTIONS</a> in product instructions. <br>IF ANY OTHER CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE EXTRACT CONCENTRATE FORMULA: Changes other than those listed above may include situations such as a redistribution of component parts or percentages, a difference in extracting fluid (i.e., change from non-glycerin extracts to 50% glycerin extracts), combining two or more stock concentrates, or any other change.<br>It should be recognized that any change in formula can affect a patientâ€™s tolerance of the treatment. The usual 1/2 of the previous dose for a new extract may produce an adverse reaction: extra dilutions are recommended whenever starting a revised formula.

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34072-9">
<a name="section-6.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>(1) General </h2>
<p class="First">Concentrated extracts must be diluted prior to use: See <a href="#DosageandAdministration">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a> Section below for detailed instructions on the dilution of allergenic extracts. <br>Any evidence of a local or generalized reaction requires a reduction in dosage during the initial stages of immunotherapy, as well as during maintenance therapy. <br>Allergenic extracts diluted with sterile Albumin Saline with Phenol (0.4%) diluent may be more potent than extracts diluted with diluents which do not contain stabilizers. When changing from non-stabilized to stabilized diluent, consider weaker initial dilutions for both intradermal testing and immunotherapy. <br>Sterile solutions, vials, syringes, etc. should be used and aseptic precautions observed in making dilutions. <br>To avoid cross-contamination, do not use the same needle to withdraw materials from vials of more than one extract, or extract followed by diluent. <br>A sterile tuberculin syringe graduated in 0.01 mL units should be used to measure each dose from the appropriate dilution. Aseptic techniques should always be employed when injections of allergenic extracts are being administered. <br>A separate sterile syringe should be used for each patient to prevent transmission of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4281232" conceptname="Type B viral hepatitis">serum hepatitis</span> and other infectious agents from one person to another. <br>Patient reactions to previous injections should be reviewed before each new injection. A conservative dosage schedule should be followed by the physician until a pattern of local responses is established which can be used to monitor increases in dosage. <br>Rarely, a patient is encountered who develops systemic reactions to minute doses of allergen and does not demonstrate increasing tolerance to injections after several months of treatment. If systemic reactions or excessive local responses occur persistently at very small doses, efforts at immunotherapy should be stopped. <br>PATIENTS SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN THE OFFICE FOR 30 MINUTES AFTER EACH TREATMENT INJECTION. Most severe reactions will occur within this time period, and rapid treatment measures should be instituted. See <a href="#AdverseReactions">ADVERSE REACTIONS </a>Section for such treatment measures.</p>

<h2>(5) Pregnancy</h2>
<p class="First">Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with allergenic extracts. It is also not known whether allergenic extracts can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Allergenic extracts should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. <br>For women who have been getting maintenance doses of allergen without side effect, the occurrence of pregnancy is not an indication to stop immunotherapy. <br></p>

Suggested dosage for infants to 2 years of age is 0.05 mL to 0.1 mL; for children 2 to 6 years, 0.15 mL; and children 6 to 12 years, 0.2 mL. Single pediatric doses should not exceed 0.3 mg (mL).

Puncture tests are performed by placing a drop of extract on the skin and piercing through the drop perpendicular to the skin with a device such as a Prick Lancetter. After about 1 minute the extract may be wiped away with a dry sponge. The diameter of wheal and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span> reactions are measured 15 minutes after the prick or puncture is made, and the sensitivity class of the patient determined by the table presented at the end of the diagnosis section. Less sensitive individuals (Class 0 to 1+) can be tested intradermally with the recommended dilutions of the extract concentrate (see intradermal testing information below). The skin test concentration of 10,000 BAU/mL (10-19.9 Fel d 1 units/mL) in dropper vials is used for prick or puncture testing.

tests were completed using the same 15 subjects to determine the mean
concentration required to produce a âˆ‘E of
50mm (D<span class="Sub">50</span>). That concentration contained 0.049 BAU/mL (range 0.006 to

<span class="Bold">Intradermal Tests should be done only on patients with a negative prick

intradermal test may be performed using a 1,000 BAU/mL extract
solution. If the intradermal dilutions were prepared from glycerinated

contain 5% glycerol. Skin tests are graded in terms of the wheal and

<br><br><span class="Bold">3) Immunotherapy</span><br>Allergen
extracts should be administered using a sterile syringe with 0.01 mL
gradations and a 25-27 gauge x 1/2" to 5/8" needle. The injections are
given subcutaneously. The most common sites of injection are the
lateral aspect of the upper arm or thigh. Intracutaneous or
intramuscular injections may produce large local reactions which may be
very painful. Dosage of allergenic extracts is a highly individualized
matter and varies according to the degree of sensitivity of the
patient, his clinical response, and tolerance to the extract
administered during the early phases of an injection regimen. The
starting dose should be based on skin tests of the extract to be used
for immunotherapy. To prepare dilutions for intradermal and therapeutic
use, make a 1:10 dilution by adding 1.0 mL of the concentrate to 9.0 mL
of sterile aqueous diluent. Subsequent serial dilutions are made in a
similar manner. (See Table I.) To determine the starting dose, begin
intradermal testing with the most dilute extract preparation. Inject
0.02 mL and read the reaction after 15 minutes. Intradermal testing is
continued with increasing concentrations of the extract until a
reaction of 10-20 mm <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span> (âˆ‘E 20-40 mm) and/or a 5 mm wheal occurs.
This concentration at a dose of 0.03 mL then can serve as a starting
dose for immunotherapy and be increased by 0.03 mL to as high as 0.12
mL increments each time until 0.3 mL is reached, at which time a
dilution 10 times as strong can be used, starting with 0.03 mL. Proceed
in this way until a tolerance dose is reached or symptoms are
controlled. Suggested maintenance dose is 0.2 mL of the concentrate.
Occasionally, higher doses are necessary to relieve symptoms. Special
caution is required in administering doses greater than 0.2 mL. The
interval between doses normally is 3 to 7 days. This is offered as a
suggested schedule for average patients and will be satisfactory in
most cases. However, the degree of sensitivity varies in many patients.
The size of the dose should be adjusted and should be regulated by the
patientâ€™s tolerance and reaction. The size of the dose should be
decreased if the previous injection resulted in marked local or the
slightest general reaction. Another dose should never be given until
all local reactions resulting from the previous dose have disappeared.
In some patients, the dosage may be increased more rapidly than called
for in the schedule. In seasonal allergies, treatment should be started
and the interval between doses regulated so that at least the first 20
doses will have been administered by the time symptoms are expected.
Thus, the shorter the interval between the start of immunotherapy and
the expected onset of symptoms, the shorter the interval between each
dose. Some patients may even tolerate daily doses.  A maintenance dose,
the largest dose tolerated by the patient that relieves symptoms
without producing undesirable local or general reactions is recommended
for most patients. The upper limits of dosage have not been
established; however, doses larger than 0.2 mL of the glycerinated
concentrate may be painful due to the glycerin content. The dosage of
allergenic extract does not vary significantly with the respiratory
allergic disease under treatment. The size of this dose and the
interval between doses will vary and can be adjusted as necessary.
Should symptoms develop before the next injection is scheduled, the
interval between doses should be decreased. Should allergic symptoms or
local reactions develop shortly after the dose is administered, the
size of the dose should be decreased. In seasonal allergies, it is
often advisable to decrease the dose to one-half or one-quarter of the
maximum dose previously attained if the patient has any seasonal
symptoms. The interval between maintenance doses can be increased
gradually from one week to 10 days, to two weeks, to three weeks, or
even to four weeks if tolerated. Repeat the doses at a given interval
three or four times to check for untoward reactions before further
increasing the interval. Protection is lost rapidly if the interval
between doses is more than four weeks. (See <a href="#warnings">   WARNINGS </a>Section.) The
usual duration of treatment has not been established. A period of two
or three years of injection therapy constitutes an average minimum
course of treatment. <br><a name="i1d575ab2-0282-4a06-838c-b2e9f37f0b85"></a><table border="1" cellspacing="1" width="621">
