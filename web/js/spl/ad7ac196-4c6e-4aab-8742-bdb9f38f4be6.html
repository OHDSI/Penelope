<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Fentanyl buccal tablets are a potent opioid analgesic, intended for buccal mucosal administration. Fentanyl buccal tablets are formulated as a flat-faced, round, beveled-edge white to off-white tablet.</p>
<p>Fentanyl buccal tablets are designed to be placed and retained within the buccal cavity for a period sufficient to allow dissolution of the tablet and absorption of fentanyl across the oral mucosa.</p>
<p>Watson’s fentanyl buccal tablets employ immediate-release drug delivery technology which releases the drug substance upon dissolution.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Active Ingredient:</span>  Fentanyl citrate, USP is N-(1-Phenethyl-4-piperidyl) propionanilide citrate (1:1). Fentanyl is a highly lipophilic compound (octanol-water partition coefficient at pH 7.4 is 816:1) that is freely soluble in organic solvents and sparingly soluble in water (1:40). The molecular weight of the free base is 336.5 (the citrate salt is 528.6). The pKa of the tertiary nitrogens are 7.3 and 8.4. The compound has the following structural formula:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="Fentanyl citrate structural formula" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=ad7ac196-4c6e-4aab-8742-bdb9f38f4be6&amp;name=fentanyl-buccal-tablets-2.jpg"></div>
<p>All tablet strengths are expressed as the amount of fentanyl free base, e.g., the 100 microgram strength tablet contains 100 micrograms of fentanyl free base.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Inactive Ingredients:</span> Mannitol, sodium starch glycolate, potassium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span>, and magnesium stearate.</p>

<h2>Pharmacology:</h2>
<p class="First">Fentanyl is a pure opioid agonist whose principal therapeutic action is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>. Other members of the class known as opioid agonists include substances such as morphine, oxycodone, hydromorphone, codeine, and hydrocodone. Pharmacological effects of opioid agonists include anxiolysis, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142453" conceptname="Feeling high">euphoria</span>, feelings of relaxation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">constipation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435279" conceptname="Tonic pupillary reaction">miosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4009383" conceptname="Cough suppression">cough suppression</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>. Like all pure opioid agonist analgesics, with increasing doses there is increasing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, unlike with mixed agonist/antagonists or non-opioid analgesics, where there is a limit to the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span> with increasing doses. With pure opioid agonist analgesics, there is no defined maximum dose; the ceiling to analgesic effectiveness is imposed only by side effects, the more serious of which may include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">Analgesia</span></h2>
<p class="First">The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effects</span> of fentanyl are related to the blood level of the drug, if proper allowance is made for the delay into and out of the CNS (a process with a 3-to-5-minute half-life).</p>
<p>In general, the effective concentration and the concentration at which toxicity occurs increase with increasing tolerance with any and all opioids. The rate of development of tolerance varies widely among individuals. As a result, the dose of fentanyl buccal tablets should be individually titrated to achieve the desired effect. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_57264012-1f97-491b-ac0d-cd354b14d237">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>.)</p>

<h2>Central Nervous System</h2>
<p class="First">The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown although fentanyl is known to be a mu opioid receptor agonist. Specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and play a role in the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effects</span> of this drug.</p>
<p>Fentanyl produces <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem to increases in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135927" conceptname="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</span> and to electrical stimulation.</p>
<p>Fentanyl depresses the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> reflex by direct effect on the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>. Fentanyl causes <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435279" conceptname="Tonic pupillary reaction">miosis</span> even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings).</p>

<h2>Gastrointestinal System</h2>
<p class="First">Fentanyl causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and in the duodenum. Digestion of food is delayed in the small intestine and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">constipation</span>. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.</p>

<h2>Cardiovascular System</h2>
<p class="First">Fentanyl may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318566" conceptname="Flushing">flushing</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442546" conceptname="Red eye">red eyes</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span>, and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span>.</p>

<h2>Endocrine System</h2>
<p class="First">Opioid agonists have been shown to have a variety of effects on the secretion of hormones. Opioids inhibit the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon in humans and other species, rats and dogs. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) has been shown to be both inhibited and stimulated by opioids.</p>

<a name="LINK_dbb6d71e-bf26-49e6-95ee-5f41cad43726"></a><a name="section-3.7"></a><p></p>
<h2>Respiratory System</h2>
<p class="First">All opioid mu-receptor agonists, including fentanyl, produce dose dependent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>. The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> is less in patients receiving chronic opioid therapy who develop tolerance to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> and other opioid effects. During the titration phase of the clinical trials, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, which may be a precursor to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, did increase in patients who were treated with higher doses of another oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (Actiq<span class="Sup">®‡</span>). Peak respiratory depressive effects may be seen as early as 15 to 30 minutes from the start of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate product administration and may persist for several hours.</p>
<p>Serious or fatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> can occur even at recommended doses. Fentanyl depresses the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> reflex as a result of its CNS activity. Although not observed with oral transmucosal fentanyl products in clinical trials, fentanyl given rapidly by intravenous injection in large doses may interfere with respiration by causing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4050941" conceptname="Muscle rigidity">rigidity</span> in the muscles of respiration. Therefore, physicians and other healthcare providers should be aware of this potential complication.</p>

<h2>PHARMACOKINETICS</h2>
<p class="First">Fentanyl exhibits linear pharmacokinetics. Systemic exposure to fentanyl following administration of fentanyl buccal tablets increases linearly in an approximate dose-proportional manner over the 100- to 800-mcg dose range.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="LINK_ff7e76a4-f366-471e-a7b4-9051ebe35252"></a><a name="section-3.9"></a><p></p>
<h2>Absorption:</h2>
<p class="First">Following buccal administration of fentanyl buccal tablets, fentanyl is readily absorbed with an absolute bioavailability of 65%.  The absorption profile of fentanyl buccal tablets is largely the result of an initial absorption from the buccal mucosa, with peak plasma concentrations following venous sampling generally attained within an hour after buccal administration. Approximately 50% of the total dose administered is absorbed transmucosally and becomes systemically available.  The remaining half of the total dose is swallowed and undergoes more prolonged absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
<p>In a study that compared the absolute and relative bioavailability of fentanyl buccal tablets and Actiq<span class="Sup">®‡</span> (oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate), the rate and extent of fentanyl absorption were considerably different (approximately 30% greater exposure with fentanyl buccal tablets) (Table 1).</p>

<p>Similarly, in another bioavailability study exposure following administration of fentanyl buccal tablets was also greater (approximately 50%) compared to Actiq<span class="Sup">®‡</span>.</p>
<p>Due to differences in drug delivery, measures of exposure (C<span class="Sub">max</span>, AUC<span class="Sub">0-tmax</span>, AUC<span class="Sub">0-inf</span>) associated with a given dose of fentanyl were substantially greater with fentanyl buccal tablets compared to Actiq<span class="Sup">®‡</span> (see Figure 1).  Therefore, caution must be exercised when switching patients from one product to another.

<h2>Distribution:</h2>
<p class="First">Fentanyl is highly lipophilic. The plasma protein binding of fentanyl is 80 to 85%. The main binding protein is alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, but both albumin and lipoproteins contribute to some extent. The mean oral volume of distribution at steady state (Vss/F) was 25.4 L/kg.</p>

<h2>Metabolism:</h2>
<p class="First">The metabolic pathways following buccal administration of fentanyl buccal tablets have not been characterized in clinical studies. The progressive decline of fentanyl plasma concentrations results from the uptake of fentanyl in the tissues and biotransformation in the liver. Fentanyl is metabolized in the liver and in the intestinal mucosa to norfentanyl by cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform.  In animal studies, norfentanyl was not found to be pharmacologically active. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_0e2af5f8-92d0-486a-93f5-cc15d16c708f">PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions</a></span> for additional information.)</p>

<h2>Elimination:</h2>
<p class="First">Disposition of fentanyl following buccal administration of fentanyl buccal tablets has not been characterized in a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> balance study.  Fentanyl is primarily (more than 90%) eliminated by biotransformation to N-dealkylated and hydroxylated inactive metabolites.  Less than 7% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, and only about 1% is excreted unchanged in the feces.  The metabolites are mainly excreted in the urine, while fecal excretion is less important.</p>
<p>The total plasma clearance of fentanyl following intravenous administration is approximately 42 L/h.</p>

<h2>Race</h2>
<p class="First">The pharmacokinetic effects of race with the use of fentanyl buccal tablets have not been systematically evaluated.  In studies conducted in healthy Japanese subjects, systemic exposure was generally higher than that observed in US subjects (mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values were approximately 50% and 20% higher, respectively).  The observed differences were largely attributed to the lower mean weight of the Japanese subjects compared to US subjects (57.4 kg versus 73 kg).</p>

<p class="First">Systemic exposure was higher for women than men (mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values were approximately 28% and 22% higher, respectively).  The observed differences between men and women were largely attributable to differences in weight.</p>

<h2>Renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic Impairment</span>:</h2>
<p class="First">The effect of renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> on the pharmacokinetics of fentanyl buccal tablets has not been studied. Although fentanyl kinetics are known to be altered as a result of hepatic and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span> due to alterations in metabolic clearance and plasma protein binding, the duration of effect for the initial dose of fentanyl is largely determined by the rate of distribution of the drug.</p>
<p>Diminished metabolic clearance may, therefore, become significant, primarily with repeated dosing or at very high single doses.  For these reasons, while it is recommended that fentanyl buccal tablets are titrated to clinical effect for all patients, special care should be taken in patients with severe hepatic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>.

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">The interaction between ritonavir and fentanyl was investigated in eleven healthy volunteers in a randomized crossover study. Subjects received oral ritonavir or placebo for 3 days. The ritonavir dose was 200 mg tid on Day 1 and 300 mg tid on Day 2 followed by one morning dose of 300 mg on Day 3. On Day 2, fentanyl was given as a single IV dose at 5 mcg/kg two hours after the afternoon dose of oral ritonavir or placebo. Naloxone was administered to counteract the side effects of fentanyl. The results suggested that ritonavir might decrease the clearance of fentanyl by 67%, resulting in a 174% (range 52% to 420%) increase in fentanyl AUC<span class="Sub">0-inf</span>. Coadministration of ritonavir in patients receiving fentanyl buccal tablets has not been studied; however, an increase in fentanyl AUC is expected.

<h2>CLINICAL TRIALS</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Breakthrough <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">Pain</span>: </span></p>
<p>The efficacy of fentanyl buccal tablets was demonstrated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in opioid tolerant patients with cancer and breakthrough <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>.  Patients considered opioid tolerant were those who were taking at least 60 mg of oral morphine/day, at least 25 mcg of transdermal fentanyl/hour, at  least 30 mg of oxycodone daily, at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone daily or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for a week or longer.</p>
<p>In this trial, patients were titrated in an open-label manner to a successful dose of fentanyl buccal tablets. A successful dose was defined as the dose in which a patient obtained adequate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> with tolerable side effects.  Patients who identified a successful dose were randomized to a sequence of 10 treatments with 7 being the successful dose of fentanyl buccal tablets and 3 being placebo. Patients used one tablet (either fentanyl buccal tablets or Placebo) per breakthrough <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> episode.</p>
<p>Patients assessed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> intensity on a scale that rated the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> as 0=none to 10=worst possible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>. With each episode of breakthrough <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> intensity was assessed first and then treatment was administered. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">Pain</span> intensity (0 to 10) was measured at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after the start of administration.  The sum of differences in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> intensity scores at 15 and 30 minutes from baseline (SPID<span class="Sub">30</span>) was the primary efficacy measure.</p>
<p>Sixty five percent of patients who entered the study achieved a successful dose during the titration phase. The distribution of successful doses is shown in Table 4.  The median dose was 400 mcg.</p>

<p class="First">The concomitant use of other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors), and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312603" conceptname="Hypoventilation">Hypoventilation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, and profound sedation may occur.</p>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Addiction and Diversion of Opioids</h2>
<p class="First">Fentanyl buccal tablets contain fentanyl, a mu-opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with high potential for abuse similar to hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, and oxymorphone.  Fentanyl can be abused and is subject to misuse, and criminal diversion.</p>
<p>Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>.  However, all patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, since use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use.</p>
<p>Addiction is a primary, chronic, neurobiologic disease, with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations.  It is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following:  impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug addiction</span> is a treatable disease, utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common.</p>
<p>“Drug-seeking? behavior is very common in addicts and drug abusers. Fentanyl buccal tablets should be prescribed with caution to patients who have a higher risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4279309" conceptname="Substance abuse">substance abuse</span>, including patients with bipolar disorder and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span>.</p>
<p>Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436096" conceptname="Chronic pain">chronic pain</span> may be at a higher risk for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>.</p>
<p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> and tolerance.  Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> in all addicts.  In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction and is characterized by misuse for nonmedical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances.  Since fentanyl buccal tablets may be diverted for non-medical use, careful record keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised.</p>
<p>Proper assessment of patients, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</p>
<p>Fentanyl buccal tablets should be handled appropriately to minimize the risk of diversion, including restriction of access and accounting procedures as appropriate to the clinical setting and as required by law.</p>
<p>Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board, or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</p>

<h2>Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">Dependence</span> and Withdrawal</h2>
<p class="First">The administration of fentanyl buccal tablets should be guided by the response of the patient. Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>, per se, is not ordinarily a concern when one is treating a patient with cancer and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436096" conceptname="Chronic pain">chronic pain</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029621" conceptname="Fear">fear</span> of tolerance and physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> should not deter using doses that adequately relieve the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>.</p>
<p>Opioid analgesics may cause physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>. Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> results in withdrawal symptoms in patients who abruptly discontinue the drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity, e.g., naloxone, nalmefene, or mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (pentazocine, butorphanol, buprenorphine, nalbuphine).</p>
<p>Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> usually does not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several weeks of continued opioid usage. Tolerance, in which increasingly larger doses are required in order to produce the same degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, is initially manifested by a shortened duration of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span>, and subsequently, by decreases in the intensity of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>.</p>

<p>Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4); therefore potential interactions may occur when fentanyl buccal tablets are given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. The concomitant use of fentanyl buccal tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazadone) or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, and verapamil) may result in increased fentanyl plasma concentrations, potentially causing serious adverse drug effects including fatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>. Patients receiving fentanyl buccal tablets concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time.

Fentanyl buccal tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. No epidemiological studies of congenital anomalies in infants born to women treated with fentanyl during pregnancy have been reported.</p>
<p>Chronic maternal treatment with fentanyl during pregnancy has been associated with transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, behavioral changes, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> characteristic of neonatal abstinence syndrome in newborn infants. Symptoms of neonatal respiratory or neurological <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> were no more frequent than expected in most studies of infants born to women treated acutely during labor with intravenous or epidural fentanyl. Transient neonatal muscular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4050941" conceptname="Muscle rigidity">rigidity</span> has been observed in infants whose mothers were treated with intravenous fentanyl.</p>
<p>Fentanyl is embryocidal as evidenced by increased resorptions in pregnant rats at doses of 30 mcg/kg IV or 160 mcg/kg SC. Conversion to human equivalent doses indicates this is within the range of the human recommended dosing for fentanyl buccal tablets.</p>
<p>Fentanyl citrate was not teratogenic when administered to pregnant animals. Published studies demonstrated that administration of fentanyl (10, 100, or 500 mcg/kg/day) to pregnant rats from day 7 to 21, of their 21 day gestation, via implanted microosmotic minipumps was not teratogenic (the high dose was approximately 3-times the human dose of 1600 mcg per <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> episode on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). Intravenous administration of fentanyl (10 or 30 mcg/kg) to pregnant female rats from gestation day 6 to 18, was embryo or fetal toxic, and caused a slightly increased mean delivery time in the 30 mcg/kg/day group, but was not teratogenic.</p>

<h2>Labor and Delivery</h2>
<p class="First">Fentanyl readily passes across the placenta to the fetus; therefore fentanyl buccal tablets are not recommended for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> during labor and delivery.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Fentanyl is excreted in human milk; therefore fentanyl buccal tablets should not be used in nursing women because of the possibility of sedation and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> in their infants. Symptoms of opioid withdrawal may occur in infants at the cessation of nursing by women using fentanyl buccal tablets.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Of the 304 patients with cancer in clinical studies of fentanyl buccal tablets, 69 (23%) were 65 years of age and older.</p>
<p>Patients over the age of 65 years tended to titrate to slightly lower doses than younger patients.</p>
<p>Patients over the age of 65 years reported a slightly higher frequency for some adverse events specifically <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">constipation</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal pain</span>.  Therefore, caution should be exercised in individually titrating fentanyl buccal tablets in elderly patients to provide adequate efficacy while minimizing risk.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Underline">Pre-Marketing Clinical Trial Experience </span></p>
<p>The safety of fentanyl buccal tablets has been evaluated in 304 opioid tolerant cancer patients with breakthrough <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>. The average duration of therapy was 76 days with some patients being treated for over 12 months.</p>
<p>The most commonly observed adverse events seen with fentanyl buccal tablets are typical of opioid side effects. Opioid side effects should be expected and managed accordingly.</p>
<p>The clinical trials of fentanyl buccal tablets were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating patients with cancer and breakthrough <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>; all patients were taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine, sustained-release oxycodone or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>.</p>
<p>The adverse event data presented here reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received fentanyl buccal tablets for breakthrough <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> along with a concomitant opioid for persistent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>.  There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of fentanyl buccal tablets therapy or cancer-related symptoms.</p>
<p>Table 5 lists, by maximum dose received, adverse events with an overall frequency of 5% or greater within the total population that occurred during titration.  The ability to assign a dose-response relationship to these adverse events is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies.</p>

<h2>Clinical Presentation</h2>
<p class="First">The manifestations of fentanyl buccal tablets overdosage are expected to be similar in nature to intravenous fentanyl and other opioids, and are an extension of its pharmacological actions with the most serious significant effect being <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312603" conceptname="Hypoventilation">hypoventilation</span>.

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Immediate management of opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> includes removal of the fentanyl buccal tablet, if still in the mouth, ensuring a patient airway, physical and verbal stimulation of the patient, and assessment of level of consciousness, as well as ventilatory and circulatory status.</p>

<h2>Treatment of Overdosage in the Opioid Non-Tolerant Person</h2>
<p class="First">Ventilatory support should be provided, intravenous access obtained, and naloxone or other opioid antagonists should be employed as clinically indicated. The duration of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> following <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> may be longer than the effects of the opioid antagonist’s action (e.g., the half-life of naloxone ranges from 30 to 81 minutes) and repeated administration may be necessary. Consult the package insert of the individual opioid antagonist for details about such use.</p>

<h2>Treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">Overdose</span> in Opioid-Tolerant Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Ventilatory support should be provided and intravenous access obtained as clinically indicated. Judicious use of naloxone or another opioid antagonist may be warranted in some instances, but it is associated with the risk of precipitating an acute withdrawal syndrome.</p>

<h2>General Considerations for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">Overdose</span></h2>
<p class="First">Management of severe fentanyl buccal tablets <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> includes:  securing a patient airway, assisting or controlling ventilation, establishing intravenous access, and GI decontamination by lavage and/or activated charcoal, once the patient’s airway is secure. In the presence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312603" conceptname="Hypoventilation">hypoventilation</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span>, ventilation should be assisted or controlled and oxygen administered as indicated.</p>
<p>Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> should be carefully observed and appropriately managed until their clinical condition is well controlled.</p>
<p>Although <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4050941" conceptname="Muscle rigidity">muscle rigidity</span> interfering with respiration has not been seen following the use of fentanyl buccal tablets, this is possible with fentanyl and other opioids. If it occurs, it should be managed by the use of assisted or controlled ventilation, by an opioid antagonist, and as a final alternative, by a neuromuscular blocking agent.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Physicians should individualize treatment using a progressive plan of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> management.  Healthcare professionals should follow appropriate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> management principles of careful assessment and ongoing monitoring.
