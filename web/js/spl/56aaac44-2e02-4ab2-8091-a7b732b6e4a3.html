<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span><span>PHARMACOLOGY</span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>XylaMedâ„¢ a non-narcotic compound, is a sedative and analgesic as well as muscle relaxant. Its sedative and analgesic activity is related to central nervous system <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>. Its muscle-relaxant effect is based on inhibition of the intraneural transmission of impulses in the central nervous system. The principal pharmacological activities develop within 10 to 15 minutes after intramuscular injection, and within 3 to 5 minutes following intravenous administration in horses.</span></span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A sleeplike state, the depth of which is dose-dependent, is usually maintained for 1 to 2 hours, while <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> lasts from 15 to 30 minutes. The centrally acting muscle relaxant effect causes relaxation of the skeletal musculature, complementing sedation and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In horses and <span class="Italics">Cervidae </span>under the influence of XylaMedâ„¢ the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4313591" conceptname="Respiratory rate">respiratory rate</span> is reduced as in natural sleep. Following treatment with XylaMedâ„¢ the heart rate is decreased and a transient change in the conductivity of the cardiac muscle may occur, as evidenced by a partial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316135" conceptname="Atrioventricular block">atrioventricular block</span>. This resembles the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316135" conceptname="Atrioventricular block">atrioventricular block</span> often observed in normal horses. 1, 2, 3, 4 Although a partial</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A-V block may occasionally occur following intramuscular injection of XylaMedâ„¢, the incidence is less than when it is administered intravenously. Intravenous administration of XylaMedâ„¢ causes a transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="141693" conceptname="Elevated blood-pressure reading without diagnosis of hypertension">rise in blood pressure</span>, followed by a slight decrease.</span></span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span><span>XylaMedâ„¢ has no effect on blood clotting time or other hematologic parameters.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="Bold"><span><span>Horses:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>1.</span><span><span>Dosage:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>lntravenously-0.5 mL/100 lbs body weight (0.5 mg/lb)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>lntramuscularly-1.0 mL/100 lbs body weight (1.0 mg/lb)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Following injection of XylaMedâ„¢, the animal should be allowed to rest quietly until the full effect has been reached.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>These dosages produce sedation which is usually maintained for 1 to 2 hours, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> which lasts for 15 to 30 minutes.</span></span></p>
<p><span>2.</span><span><span>Preanesthetic to Local Anesthesia:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>XylaMedâ„¢ at the recommended dosages can be used in conjunction with local anesthetics, such as procaine or lidocaine.</span></span></p>
<p><span>3.</span><span><span>Preanesthetic to General Anesthesia:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>XylaMedâ„¢ at the recommended dosage rates, produces an additive effect to central nervous system depressants such as pentobarbital sodium, thiopental sodium and thiamylal sodium. Therefore, the dosage of such compounds should be reduced and administered to the desired effect. In general, only 1/3 to 1/2 of the calculated dosage of the barbiturates will be needed to produce a surgical plane of anesthesia. Post-anesthetic or emergence <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">excitement</span> has not been observed in animals preanesthetized with XylaMedâ„¢.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>XylaMedâ„¢ has been used successfully as a preanesthetic agent for pentobarbital sodium, thiopental sodium, thiamylal sodium, nitrous oxide, ether, halothane, glyceryl guaiacolate and methoxyflurane anesthesia.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>XylaMedâ„¢, in horses and <span class="Italics">Cervidae</span>, used at recommended dosage levels may occasionally cause slight muscle <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremors</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span> with partial A-V <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316135" conceptname="Atrioventricular block">heart block</span> and a reduced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4313591" conceptname="Respiratory rate">respiratory rate</span>. Movement in response to sharp auditory stimuli may be observed.

<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span><span>PRECAUTlONS</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Careful consideration should be given before administering to horses or <span class="Italics">Cervidae, </span>with significantly depressed respiration, severe pathologic heart disease, advanced liver or kidney disease, severe endotoxic or traumatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span>, or stress conditions such as extreme heat, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">cold</span>, high altitude or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do not use XylaMedâ„¢ in conjunction with tranquilizers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">Analgesic effect</span> is variable, and depth should be carefully assayed prior to surgical/clinical procedures. Variability of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> occurs most frequently at the distal extremities of horses and <span class="Italics">Cervidae. </span><span class="Bold">In spite of sedation, the practitioner and handlers should proceed with caution since defense reactions may not be diminished.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span><span>Horses:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Since an additive effect results from the use of XylaMedâ„¢ and the barbiturate compounds, it should be used with caution with these central nervous system depressants. Products known to produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span>, such as thiamylal sodium, should be given at a reduced dosage and, when injected intravenously, should be administered slowly. When intravenous administration is desired, avoid perivascular injection in order to achieve the desired effect. Studies have shown negligible evidence of tissue irritation, however, following perivascular injection of xylazine.</span></span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span class="Bold">lntracarotid Arterial Injection Should Be Avoided.</span> As with many compounds, including tranquilizers, immediate violent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> followed by collapse may result from inadvertent administration into the carotid artery. Although the reaction with XylaMedâ„¢ is usually transient and recovery may be rapid and</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>complete, special care should be taken to assure that the needle is in the jugular vein rather than the carotid artery.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">Bradycardia</span> and an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span> in the form of incomplete <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316135" conceptname="Atrioventricular block">atrioventricular block</span> have been reported following xylazine administration. Although clinically the importance of this effect is questioned,</span><span>1,2,3,4 a standard dose of atropine given prior to or following xylazine will greatly decrease the incidence.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Sedation for transport is most successful if actual transportation is begun after the full effect of the drug has been reached and the animal's stability is maintained while standing. In addition, it should be noted that animals under the influence of XylaMedâ„¢ can be aroused by noise or other stimuli and this may increase the risk of injury.</span></span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><span><span>Cervidae:</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As in all ruminants, it is preferable to administer XylaMedâ„¢ to fasted <span class="Italics">Cervidae </span>as a safeguard against <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span> of food material into the lungs and/or bloat during deep sedation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Care should be taken to administer XylaMedâ„¢ in the heavy muscles of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260134" conceptname="Croup">croup</span> or shoulder. Injections given subcutaneously, intraperitoneally or into fat deposits will give unpredictable results.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Intra-arterial injection should be avoided. As with many compounds, including tranquilizers, immediate violent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> followed by collapse may result from inadvertent administration into an artery.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The animal should not be disturbed during induction or until the full effect of the drug has been reached, which is usually 10 to 15 minutes following injection.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The usual time to initial effect of the drug is 2 to 5 minutes. The administrator of the drug should be fully cognizant of this interval prior to administration of drug to free ranging deer or elk, especially at night or in heavily wooded areas.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the animal has been underdosed (faulty injection or miscalculation of weight) it is advisable to wait one hour before administering a second dose.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Adequate ventilation, especially in cages or crates, is mandatory; keep head and neck in position to insure patent air passage and to prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span> of stomach contents.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>During sedation animals should be prevented from assuming lateral recumbency. A sternal recumbent position is desirable.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>While under the effects of XylaMedâ„¢ the animal should be protected from an extremely hot or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">cold</span> environment.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Efforts should be made to prevent patient from rising until almost complete recovery is attained.</span></span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The transportation of <span class="Italics">Cervidae </span>given XylaMedâ„¢ should be carefully monitored to prevent excessive struggling, injury or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hyperthermic reactions may occur, especially if the subject is in a highly excited state when the drug is administered. Hosing the head and entire body with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">cold</span> water has usually proven to be an effective deterrent.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The safety of XylaMedâ„¢ has not been demonstrated in pregnant <span class="Italics">Cervidae</span>.Â  Avoid use during the breeding season.<span class="Italics"></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span class="Italics">Cervidae </span>should be observed closely until all of the sedative effects of XylaMedâ„¢ are gone.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Care should be taken at all times when administering XylaMedâ„¢ to <span class="Italics">Cervidae.Â  </span>This is due to the method of administration (usually darting), the difficulty in estimating body weights and the accepted theory that wild animals are <span class="Italics"></span>more unpredictable in their response to sedatives and analgesics than the domesticated species.</span></span></p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span><span>SAFETY</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>XylaMedâ„¢ is tolerated at 10 times the recommended dose in horses, and at doses above the recommended range in <span class="Italics">Cervidae. </span>However, some elevated doses produced muscle <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremors</span> and long periods of sedation.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span><span>WARNING</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This drug should not be administered to domestic food-producing animals. Not for use in horses intended for food.</span></span></p>
