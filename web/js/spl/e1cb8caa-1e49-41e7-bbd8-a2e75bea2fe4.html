<p>Blood level studies comparing clindamycin palmitate HCl with clindamycin hydrochloride show that both drugs reach their peak active serum levels at the same time, indicating a rapid hydrolysis of the palmitate to the clindamycin.</p>
<p>Clindamycin is widely distributed in body fluids and tissues (including bones). Approximately 10% of the biological activity is excreted in the urine. The average serum half-life after doses of clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride for oral solution (Pediatric) is approximately two hours in pediatric patients.</p>
<p>Serum half-life of clindamycin is increased slightly in patients with markedly reduced renal function. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not effective in removing clindamycin from the serum.</p>
<p>Serum level studies with clindamycin palmitate HCl in normal pediatric patients weighing 50 to 100 lbs given 2, 3 or 4 mg/kg every 6 hours (8, 12 or 16 mg/kg/day) demonstrated mean peak clindamycin serum levels of 1.24, 2.25 and 2.44 mcg/mL respectively, one hour after the first dose. By the fifth dose, the 6-hour serum concentration had reached equilibrium. Peak serum concentrations after this time would be about 2.46, 2.98 and 3.79 mcg/mL with doses of 8, 12 and 16 mg/kg/day, respectively.</p>
<p>Serum levels have been uniform and predictable from person to person and dose to dose. Multiple-dose studies in neonates and infants up to 6 months of age show that the drug does not accumulate in the serum and is excreted rapidly. Serum levels exceed the MICs for most indicated organisms for at least six hours following administration of the usually recommended doses of clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride for oral solution (Pediatric) in adults and pediatric patients.</p>
<p>No significant levels of clindamycin are attained in the cerebrospinal fluid, even in the presence of inflamed meninges.</p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic studies in elderly volunteers (61 to 79 years) and younger adults (18 to 39 years) indicate that age alone does not alter clindamycin pharmacokinetics (clearance, elimination half-life, volume of distribution, and area under the serum concentration-time curve) after IV administration of clindamycin phosphate.</p>
<p>After oral administration of clindamycin hydrochloride, elimination half-life is increased to approximately 4.0 hours (range 3.4 to 5.1 h) in the elderly compared to 3.2 hours (range 2.1 to 4.2 h) in younger adults; administration of clindamycin palmitate HCl resulted in a similar elimination half-life value of about 4.5 hours in elderly subjects. However, the extent of absorption is not different between age groups and no dosage alteration is necessary for the elderly with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">1</span></span>.<br></p>

<p>Bacteriologic studies should be performed to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to clindamycin.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">In Vitro</span> Susceptibility Testing:</span><br></p>
<p>A standardized disk testing procedure<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">2</span></span> is recommended for determining susceptibility of aerobic bacteria to clindamycin. A description is contained in the clindamycin susceptibility disk insert. Using this method, the laboratory can designate isolates as resistant, intermediate, or susceptible. Tube or agar dilution methods may be used for both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. When the directions in the clindamycin susceptibility powder insert are followed, an MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) of 1.6 mcg/mL may be considered susceptible; MICs of 1.6 to 4.8 mcg/mL may be considered intermediate and MICs greater than 4.8 mcg/mL may be considered resistant.</p>
<p>Clindamycin Susceptibility Disks 2 mcg. See package insert for use.</p>
<p>Clindamycin Susceptibility Powder 20 mg. See package insert for use.</p>
<p>For anaerobic bacteria the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of clindamycin can be determined by agar dilution and broth dilution (including microdilution) techniques. If MICs are not determined routinely, the disk broth method is recommended for routine use. <span class="Bold">THE KIRBY-BAUER DISK DIFFUSION METHOD AND ITS INTERPRETIVE STANDARDS ARE NOT RECOMMENDED FOR ANAEROBES.</span></p>
<p>To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride for oral solution (Pediatric) and other antibacterial drugs, clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride for oral solution (Pediatric) should be used only to treat or prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy.

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">General</span></p>
<p>Review of experience to date suggests that a subgroup of older patients with associated severe illness may tolerate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span> less well. When clindamycin is indicated in these patients, they should be carefully monitored for change in bowel frequency.</p>
<p>Clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride for oral solution (Pediatric) should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4272488" conceptname="Colitis">colitis</span>.</p>
<p>Clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride for oral solution (Pediatric) should be prescribed with caution in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4019380" conceptname="Atopy">atopic</span> individuals.</p>
<p>Indicated surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy.</p>
<p>The use of clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride for oral solution (Pediatric) occasionally results in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms-particularly yeasts. Should <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4105019" conceptname="Superimposed infection">superinfections</span> occur, appropriate measures should be taken as indicated by the clinical situation.</p>
<p>Clindamycin dosage modification may not be necessary in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>. In patients with moderate to severe liver disease, prolongation of clindamycin half-life has been found. However, it was postulated from studies that when given every eight hours, accumulation should rarely occur. Therefore, dosage modification in patients with liver disease may not be necessary. However, periodic liver enzyme determinations should be made when treating patients with severe liver disease.</p>
<p>Prescribing clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride for oral solution (Pediatric) in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432545" conceptname="Bacterial infectious disease">bacterial infection</span> or a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118659" conceptname="Prophylactic">prophylactic</span> indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p>

When clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride for oral solution (Pediatric) is prescribed to treat a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432545" conceptname="Bacterial infectious disease">bacterial infection</span>, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride for oral solution (Pediatric) or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">Diarrhea</span> is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued.

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Geriatric Use</span></p>
<p>Clinical studies of clindamycin did not include sufficient numbers of patients age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. However, other reported clinical experience indicates that antibiotic-associated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4272488" conceptname="Colitis">colitis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span> (due to <span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span>) seen in association with most antibiotics occur more frequently in the elderly (&gt;60 years) and may be more severe. These patients should be carefully monitored for the development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>.<br></p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic studies with clindamycin have shown no clinically important differences between young subjects (18 to 39 years) and elderly subjects (61 to 79 years) with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function after oral or intravenous administration.</p>

<h1>ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">One year oral toxicity studies in Spartan Sprague-Dawley rats and beagle dogs at dose levels up to 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.6 and 5.4 times the highest recommended adult human oral dose based on mg/m², respectively) have shown clindamycin to be well tolerated. No appreciable difference in pathological findings has been observed between groups of animals treated with clindamycin and comparable control groups. Rats receiving clindamycin hydrochloride at 600 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.2 times the highest recommended adult human oral dose based on mg/m²) for 6 months tolerated the drug well; however, dogs dosed at this level (approximately 10.8 times the highest recommended adult human oral dose based on mg/m²) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomited</span>, would not eat, and lost weight.</p>
