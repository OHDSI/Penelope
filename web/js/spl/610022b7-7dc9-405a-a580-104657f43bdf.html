<h1><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</span></h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pharmacodynamics:</span> Pilocarpine is a cholinergic parasympathomimetic agent exerting a broad spectrum of pharmacologic effects with predominant muscarinic action. Pilocarpine, in appropriate dosage, can increase secretion by the exocrine glands. The sweat, salivary, lacrimal, gastric, pancreatic, and intestinal glands and the mucous cells of the respiratory tract may be stimulated. When applied topically to the eye as a single dose it causes <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435279" conceptname="Tonic pupillary reaction">miosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375263" conceptname="Cycloplegia">spasm of accommodation</span>, and may cause a transitory rise in intraocular pressure followed by a more persistent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span>. Dose-related smooth muscle stimulation of the intestinal tract may cause increased tone, increased motility, spasm, and tenesmus. Bronchial smooth muscle tone may increase. The tone and motility of urinary tract, gallbladder, and biliary duct smooth muscle may be enhanced. Pilocarpine may have paradoxical effects on the cardiovascular system. The expected effect of a muscarinic agonist is vasodepression, but administration of pilocarpine may produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> after a brief episode of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">Bradycardia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span> have both been reported with use of pilocarpine.</p>
<p>In a study of 12 healthy male volunteers there was a dose-related increase in unstimulated salivary flow following single 5 and 10 mg oral doses of pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets. This effect of pilocarpine on salivary flow was time-related with an onset at 20 minutes and a peak effect at 1 hour with a duration of 3 to 5 hours (See Pharmacokinetics section).</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Head &amp; Neck Cancer Patients:</span> In a 12 week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 207 patients (placebo, N=65; 5 mg, N=73; 10 mg, N=69), increases from baseline (means 0.072 and 0.112 mL/min, ranges -0.690 to 0.728 and -0.380 to 1.689) of whole saliva flow for the 5 mg (63%) and 10 mg (90%) tablet, respectively, were seen 1 hour after the first dose of pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets. Increases in unstimulated parotid flow were seen following the first dose (means 0.025 and 0.046 mL/min, ranges 0 to 0.414 and -0.070 to 1.002 mL/min for the 5 and 10 mg dose, respectively). In this study, no correlation existed between the amount of increase in salivary flow and the degree of symptomatic relief.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Sjogren's Syndrome Patients:</span> In two 12 week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in 629 patients (placebo, N=253; 2.5 mg, N=121; 5 mg, N=255; 5-7.5 mg, N=114), the ability of pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets to stimulate saliva production was assessed. In these trials using varying doses of pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets (2.5-7.5 mg), the rate of saliva production was plotted against time. An Area Under the Curve (AUC) representing the total amount of saliva produced during the observation interval was calculated. Relative to placebo, an increase in the amount of saliva being produced was observed following the first dose of pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets and was maintained throughout the duration (12 weeks) of the trials in an approximate dose response fashion (See Clinical Studies section).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics:</span> In a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study in male volunteers following 2 days of 5 or 10 mg of oral pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets given at 8 a.m., noontime, and 6 p.m., the mean elimination half-life was 0.76 hours for the 5 mg dose and 1.35 hours for the 10 mg dose. T<span class="Sub">max</span> values were 1.25 hours and 0.85 hours. C<span class="Sub">max</span> values were 15 ng/mL and 41 ng/mL. The AUC trapezoidal values were 33 h(ng/mL) and 108 h(ng/mL), respectively, for the 5 and 10 mg doses following the last 6 hour dose. Pharmacokinetics in elderly male volunteers (N=11) were comparable to those in younger men. In five healthy elderly female volunteers, the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC were approximately twice that of elderly males and young normal male volunteers.</p>
<p>When taken with a high fat meal by 12 healthy male volunteers, there was a decrease in the rate of absorption of pilocarpine from pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets. Mean T<span class="Sub">max's</span> were 1.47 and 0.87 hours, and mean C<span class="Sub">max's</span> were 51.8 and 59.2 ng/mL for fed and fasted, respectively.</p>
<p>Limited information is available about the metabolism and elimination of pilocarpine in humans. Inactivation of pilocarpine is thought to occur at neuronal synapses and probably in plasma. Pilocarpine and its minimally active or inactive degradation products, including pilocarpic acid, are excreted in the urine. Pilocarpine does not bind to human or rat plasma proteins over a concentration range of 5 to 25,000 ng/mL. The effect of pilocarpine on plasma protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. In patients with mild to moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> (N=12), administration of a single 5 mg dose resulted in a 30% decrease in total plasma clearance and a doubling of exposure (as measured by AUC). Peak plasma levels were also increased by about 30% and half-life was increased to 2.1 hrs.</p>
<p>There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oral pilocarpine in volunteer subjects (N=8) with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> (mean creatinine clearances 25.4 mL/min; range 9.8 â€“ 40.8 mL/min) compared to the pharmacokinetics previously observed in normal volunteers.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Clinical Studies: </span><span class="Underline">Head &amp; Neck Cancer Patients:</span></p>
<p>A 12 week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 207 patients (142 men, 65 women) was conducted in patients whose mean age was 58.5 years with a range of 19 to 77; the racial distribution was Caucasian 95%, Black 4%, and other 1%. In this population, a statistically significant improvement in mouth dryness occurred in the 5 and 10 mg pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets treated patients compared to placebo treated patients. The 5 and 10 mg treated patients could not be distinguished. (See <a href="#LINK_cdd62375-192c-4a31-a1be-0d56a777dffb">Pharmacodynamics</a> section for flow study details.)</p>
<p>Another 12 week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 162 patients whose mean age was 57.8 years with a range of 27 to 80; the racial distribution was Caucasian 88%, Black 10%, and other 2%. The effects of placebo were compared to 2.5 mg three times a day of pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets for 4 weeks followed by adjustment to 5 mg three times a day and 10 mg three times a day. Lowering of the dose was necessary because of adverse events in 3 of 67 patients treated with 5 mg of pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets and in 7 of 66 patients treated with 10 mg of pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets. After 4 weeks of treatment, 2.5 mg of pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets three times a day was comparable to placebo in relieving dryness. In patients treated with 5 mg and 10 mg of pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets, the greatest improvement in dryness was noted in patients with no measurable salivary flow at baseline.</p>
<p>In both studies, some patients noted improvement in the global assessment of their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226991" conceptname="Aptyalism">dry mouth</span>, speaking without liquids, and a reduced need for supplemental oral comfort agents.</p>
<p>In the two placebo-controlled clinical trials, the most common adverse events related to drug, and increasing in rate as dose increases, were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4320791" conceptname="Rhinitis">rhinitis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4190045" conceptname="Rigor">chills</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318566" conceptname="Flushing">flushing</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012368" conceptname="Increased frequency of urination">urinary frequency</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">asthenia</span>. The most common adverse experience causing withdrawal from treatment was <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span> (5 mg t.i.d.â‰¤1%; 10 mg t.i.d.=12%).</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Sjogren's Syndrome Patients:</span> Two separate studies were conducted in patients with primary or secondary Sjogren's Syndrome. In both studies, the majority of patients best fit the European criteria for having primary Sjogren's Syndrome. [â€œCriteria for the Classification of Sjogren's Syndromeâ€? (Vitali C, Bombardieri S, Moutsopoulos HM, et al: Preliminary criteria for the classification of Sjogren's Syndrome. <span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4291025" conceptname="Arthritis">Arthritis</span> Rheum</span>. 1993; 36:340-347.)]</p>
<p>A 12-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 256 patients (14 men, 242 women) whose mean age was 57 years with a range of 24 to 85 years. The racial distribution was as follows: Caucasian 91%, Black 6%, and other 3%.</p>
<p>The effects of placebo were compared with those of pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets 5 mg four times a day (20 mg/day) for 6 weeks. At 6 weeks, the patients' dosage was increased from 5 mg pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets q.i.d. to 7.5 mg q.i.d. The data collected during the first 6 weeks of the trial were evaluated for safety and efficacy, and the data of the second 6 weeks of the trial were used to provide additional evidence of safety.</p>
<p>After 6 weeks of treatment, statistically significant global improvement of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226991" conceptname="Aptyalism">dry mouth</span> was observed compared to placebo. â€œGlobal improvementâ€? is defined as a score of 55 mm or more on a 100 mm visual analogue scale in response to the question, â€œPlease rate your present condition of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226991" conceptname="Aptyalism">dry mouth</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226991" conceptname="Aptyalism">xerostomia</span>) compared with your condition at the start of this study.

<p>Another 12 week randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 373 patients (16 men, 357 women) whose mean age was 55 years with a range of 21 to 84. The racial distribution was Caucasian 80%, Oriental 14%, Black 2%, and 4% of other origin. The treatment groups were 2.5 mg pilocarpine tablets, 5 mg pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets, and placebo. All treatments were administered on a four times a day regimen.</p>
<p>After 12 weeks of treatment, statistically significant global improvement of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226991" conceptname="Aptyalism">dry mouth</span> was observed at a dose of 5 mg compared with placebo.

<h2><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions
</span></h2>
<p class="First">Pilocarpine should be administered with caution to patients taking beta-adrenergic antagonists because of the possibility of conduction disturbances. Drugs with parasympathomimetic effects administered concurrently with pilocarpine would be expected to result in additive pharmacologic effects. Pilocarpine might antagonize the anticholinergic effects of drugs used concomitantly. These effects should be considered when anticholinergic properties may be contributing to the therapeutic effect of concomitant medication (e.g., atropine, inhaled ipratropium).</p>
<p>While no formal drug interaction studies have been performed, the following concomitant drugs were used in at least 10% of patients in either or both Sjogren's efficacy studies: acetylsalicylic acid, artificial tears, calcium, conjugated estrogens, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, ibuprofen, levothyroxine sodium, medroxyprogesterone acetate, methotrexate, multivitamins, naproxen, omeprazole, paracetamol, and prednisone.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
</span></h2>
<p class="First">Lifetime oral carcinogenicity studies were conducted in CD-1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. Pilocarpine did not induce tumors in mice at any dosage studied (up to 30 mg/kg/day, which yielded a systemic exposure approximately 50 times larger than the maximum systemic exposure observed clinically). In rats, a dosage of 18mg/kg/day, which yielded a systemic exposure approximately 100 times larger than the maximum systemic exposure observed clinically, resulted in a statistically significant increase in the incidence of benign <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118993" conceptname="Pheochromocytoma">pheochromocytomas</span> in both males and females, and a statistically significant increase in the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4301500" conceptname="Liver cell adenoma">hepatocellular adenomas</span> in female rats. The tumorigenicity observed in rats was observed only at a large multiple of the maximum labeled clinical dose, and may not be relevant to clinical use.</p>
<p>No evidence that pilocarpine has the potential to cause genetic toxicity was obtained in a series of studies that included: 1) bacterial assays (<span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span></span> and <span class="Italics">E. coli</span>) for reverse gene mutations; 2) an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> chromosome aberration assay in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line; 3) an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> chromosome aberration assay (micronucleus test) in mice; and 4) a primary DNA damage assay (unscheduled DNA synthesis) in rat hepatocyte primary cultures.</p>
<p>Oral administration of pilocarpine to male and female rats at a dosage of 18 mg/kg/day, which yielded a systemic exposure approximately 100 times larger than the maximum systemic exposure observed clinically, resulted in impaired reproductive function, including reduced fertility, decreased sperm motility, and morphologic evidence of abnormal sperm. It is unclear whether the reduction in fertility was due to effects on male animals, female animals, or both males and females. In dogs, exposure to pilocarpine at a dosage of 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human dose when compared on the basis of body surface area (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) estimates) for six months resulted in evidence of impaired spermatogenesis. The data obtained in these studies suggest that pilocarpine may impair the fertility of male and female humans. Pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets should be administered to individuals who are attempting to conceive a child only if the potential benefit justifies potential impairment of fertility.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold">Teratogenic Effects

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category C:</span> Pilocarpine was associated with a reduction in the mean fetal body weight and an increase in the incidence of skeletal variations when given to pregnant rats at a dosage of 90 mg/kg/day (approximately 26 times the maximum recommended dose for a 50 kg human when compared on the basis of body surface area (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) estimates). These effects may have been secondary to maternal toxicity. In another study, oral administration of pilocarpine to female rats during gestation and lactation at a dosage of 36 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the maximum recommended dose for a 50 kg human when compared on the basis of body surface area (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) estimates) resulted in an increased incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443213" conceptname="Stillbirth">stillbirths</span>; decreased neonatal survival and reduced mean body</p>

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<p>Fatal overdosage with pilocarpine has been reported in the scientific literature at doses presumed to be greater than 100 mg in two hospitalized patients. 100 mg of pilocarpine is considered potentially fatal. Overdosage should be treated with atropine titration (0.5 mg to 1.0 mg given subcutaneously or intravenously) and supportive measures to maintain respiration and circulation. Epinephrine</p>
<p>(0.3 mg to 1.0 mg, subcutaneously or intramuscularly) may also be of value in the presence of severe cardiovascular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256717" conceptname="Bronchospasm">bronchoconstriction</span>.

<h1><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</span></h1>
<p class="First">Regardless of the indication, the starting dose in patients with moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> should be 5 mg twice daily, followed by adjustment based on therapeutic response and tolerability. Patients with mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic insufficiency</span> do not require dosage reductions. The use of pilocarpine in patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic insufficiency</span> is not recommended. If needed, refer to the <span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">Hepatic Insufficiency</span></span> subsection of the <span class="Bold">Precautions</span> section of this label for definitions of mild, moderate and severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Head &amp; Neck Cancer Patients:</span> The recommended initial dose of Pilocarpine Hydrochloride Tablets is 5 mg taken three times a day. Dosage should be titrated according to therapeutic response and tolerance. The usual dosage range is up to 15-30 mg per day. (Not to exceed 10 mg per dose). Although early improvement may be realized, at least 12 weeks of uninterrupted therapy with Pilocarpine Hydrochloride Tablets may be necessary to assess whether a beneficial response will be achieved. The incidence of the most common adverse events increases with dose. The lowest dose that is tolerated and effective should be used for maintenance.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Sjogren's Syndrome Patients:</span> The recommended dose of Pilocarpine Hydrochloride Tablets is 5 mg taken four times a day. Efficacy was established by 6 weeks of use.</p>
