<p><span class="Bold">Plan Ahead.</span></p>
<p>Because smoking is an addiction, it is not easy to stop. After youâ€™ve given up cigarettes, you will still have a strong urge to smoke. Plan ahead NOW for these times, so youâ€™re not defeated in a moment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">weakness</span>. The following tips may help:</p>
<dl>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>Keep the phone numbers of supportive friends and family members handy.</dd>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>Keep a record of your quitting process. Track the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Gum pieces you use each day, and whether you feel a craving for cigarettes. In the event that you slip, immediately stop smoking and resume your quit attempt with the Nicotine Polacrilex Gum program.</dd>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>Put together an Emergency Kit that includes items that will help take your mind off occasional urges to smoke. Include cinnamon gum or lemon drops to suck on, a relaxing CD, and something for your hands to play with, like a smooth rock, rubber band, or small metal balls.</dd>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>Set aside some small rewards, like a new magazine or a gift certificate from your favorite store, which youâ€™ll â€œgiveâ€? yourself after passing difficult hurdles.</dd>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>Think now about the times when you most often want a cigarette, and then plan what else you might do instead of smoking. For instance, you might plan to take your coffee break in a new location, or take a walk right after dinner, so you wonâ€™t be tempted to smoke.</dd>

<p><span class="Bold">How Nicotine </span><span class="Bold">Polacrilex</span><span class="Bold"> Gum Works.</span></p>
<p>Nicotine Polacrilex Gum sugar-free chewing pieces provide nicotine to your system - they work as a temporary aid to help you quit smoking by reducing nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Nicotine Polacrilex Gum provides a lower level of nicotine to your blood than cigarettes, and allows you to gradually do away with your bodyâ€™s need for nicotine. Because Nicotine Polacrilex Gum does not contain the tar or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4198996" conceptname="Carbon monoxide">carbon monoxide</span> of cigarette smoke, it does not have the same health dangers as tobacco. However, it still delivers nicotine, the addictive part of cigarette smoke. Nicotine can cause side effects such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012224" conceptname="Upset stomach">upset stomach</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">If you are under 18 years of age, ask a doctor before use.</span> Before you can use Nicotine Polacrilex Gum correctly, you have to practice!

Chewed like ordinary gum, Nicotine Polacrilex Gum wonâ€™t work well and can cause side effects. An <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> can occur if you chew more than one piece of Nicotine Polacrilex Gum at the same time, or if you chew many pieces one after another. Read all the following instructions before using Nicotine Polacrilex Gum. Refer to them often to make sure youâ€™re using Nicotine Polacrilex Gum correctly. If you chew too fast, or do not chew correctly, you may get <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194475" conceptname="Hiccoughs">hiccups</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="23325" conceptname="Heartburn">heartburn</span>, or other stomach problems.

<p>To improve your chances of quitting, use at least 9 pieces of Nicotine Polacrilex Gum a day. If you experience strong or frequent cravings you may use a second piece within the hour.

<p>The goal of using Nicotine Polacrilex Gum is to slowly reduce your <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> on nicotine. The schedule for using Nicotine Polacrilex Gum will help you reduce your nicotine craving gradually as you reduce and then stop your use of Nicotine Polacrilex Gum. Here are some tips to help you cut back during each step and then stop using Nicotine Polacrilex Gum:</p>
<dl>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>After a while, start chewing each Nicotine Polacrilex Gum piece for only 10 to 15 minutes, instead of half an hour. Then, gradually begin to reduce the number of pieces used.</dd>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>Or, try chewing each piece for longer than half an hour, but reduce the number of pieces you use each day.</dd>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>Substitute ordinary chewing gum for some of the Nicotine Polacrilex Gum pieces you would normally use. Increase the number of pieces of ordinary gum as you cut back on the Nicotine Polacrilex Gum pieces.</dd>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>Check how well youâ€™ve reduced your daily usage of Nicotine Polacrilex Gum in Weeks 10 to 12. You should only be using about 3 to 5 pieces a day. Get ready to stop.</dd>

<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>Set a stop date.</dd>
<dt>â€¢</dt>

<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>Reduce the number of pieces of gum or mints you use by one piece per day until you do not need to use any gum or mints.</dd>
</dl>

<p><span class="Bold">What </span><span class="Bold">To</span><span class="Bold"> Expect.</span></p>
<p>Your body is now coming back into balance. During the first few days after you stop smoking, you might feel edgy and nervous and have trouble concentrating. You might get <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headaches</span>, feel dizzy and a little out of sorts, feel <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweaty</span> or have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4152197" conceptname="Stomach ache">stomach upsets</span>. You might even have trouble sleeping at first. These are typical withdrawal symptoms that will go away with time. Your smoker's <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> will get worse before it gets better. But donâ€™t <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">worry</span>, thatâ€™s a good sign. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">Coughing</span> helps clear the tar deposits out of your lungs.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">After A Week </span><span class="Bold">Or</span><span class="Bold"> Two.</span></p>
<p>By now you should be feeling more confident that you can handle those smoking urges. Many of your withdrawal symptoms have left by now, and you should be noticing some positive signs: less <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">coughing</span>, better breathing and an improved sense of taste and smell, to name a few.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">After A Month.</span></p>
<p>You probably have the urge to smoke much less often now. But urges may still occur, and when they do, they are likely to be powerful ones that come out of nowhere. Don't let them catch you off guard. Plan ahead for these difficult times.</p>
<p>Concentrate on the ways <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4222303" conceptname="Non-smoker">nonsmokers</span> are more attractive than smokers. Their skin is less likely to wrinkle. Their teeth are whiter, cleaner. Their breath is fresher. Their hair and clothes smell better. That <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> that seems to make even a laugh sound more like a rattle is a thing of the past. Their children and others around them are healthier, too.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What </span><span class="Bold">To</span><span class="Bold"> Do About Relapse.</span></p>
<p>What should you do if you slip and start smoking again? The answer is simple. A lapse of one or two or even a few cigarettes has not spoiled your efforts! Discard your cigarettes, forgive yourself and try again.  If you start smoking again, keep your box of Nicotine Polacrilex Gum for your next quit attempt.</p>

<p>If you have taken up regular smoking again, donâ€™t be discouraged. Research shows that the best thing you can do is to try again. The important thing is to learn from your last attempt.</p>
<dl>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>Admit that youâ€™ve slipped, but donâ€™t treat yourself as a failure.</dd>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>Try to identify the â€œtriggerâ€? that caused you to slip, and prepare a better plan for dealing with this problem next time.</dd>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>Talk positively to yourself â€“ tell yourself that you have learned something from this experience.</dd>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>Make sure you used Nicotine Polacrilex Gum correctly over the full 12 weeks to reduce your craving for nicotine.</dd>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>Remember that it takes practice to do anything, and quitting smoking is no exception.</dd>
</dl>
<p><span class="Bold">When The Struggle Is Over.</span></p>
<p>Once youâ€™ve stopped smoking, take a second and pat yourself on your back. Now do it again. You deserve it. Remember now why you decided to stop smoking in the first place. Look at your list of reasons. Read them again. And smile. Now think about all the money you are saving and what youâ€™ll do with it. All the nonsmoking places you can go, and what you might do there. All those years you may have added to your life, and what you'll do with them. Remember that temptation may not be gone forever. However, the hard part is behind you so look forward with a positive attitude, and enjoy your new life as a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4222303" conceptname="Non-smoker">nonsmoker</span>.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">2. Is Nicotine </span><span class="Bold">Polacrilex</span><span class="Bold"> Gum just substituting one form of nicotine for another?</span></p>
<p>Nicotine Polacrilex Gum does contain nicotine. The purpose of Nicotine Polacrilex Gum is to provide you with enough nicotine to help control the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can deal with the mental aspects of quitting. During the 12 week program, you will gradually reduce your nicotine intake by switching to fewer pieces each day.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">3. Can I be hurt by using Nicotine </span><span class="Bold">Polacrilex</span><span class="Bold"> Gum?</span></p>
<p>For most adults, the amount of nicotine in the gum is less than from smoking. Some people will be sensitive to even this amount of nicotine and should not use this product without advice from their doctor (see pages 4 and 5). (For Booklet Only)</p>
<p><span class="Bold">3. Can I be hurt by using Nicotine </span><span class="Bold">Polacrilex</span><span class="Bold"> Gum?</span></p>
<p>For most adults, the amount of nicotine in the gum is less than from smoking. Some people will be sensitive to even this amount of nicotine and should not use this product without advice from their doctor.  Check the Some Important Warnings section on the front of this leaflet. (For Leaflet Only)</p>
<p>Because Nicotine Polacrilex Gum is a gum-based product, chewing it can cause dental fillings to loosen and aggravate other mouth, tooth and jaw problems. Nicotine Polacrilex Gum can also cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194475" conceptname="Hiccoughs">hiccups</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="23325" conceptname="Heartburn">heartburn</span> and other stomach problems especially if chewed too quickly or not chewed correctly.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">4. Will I gain weight?</span></p>
<p>Many people do tend to gain a few pounds the first 8-10 weeks after they stop smoking. This is a very small price to pay for the enormous gains that you will make in your overall health and attractiveness. If you continue to gain weight after the first two months, try to analyze what youâ€™re doing differently. Reduce your fat intake, choose healthy snacks, and increase your physical activity to burn off the extra calories.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">5. Is Nicotine </span><span class="Bold">Polacrilex</span><span class="Bold"> Gum more expensive than smoking?</span></p>
<p>The total cost of Nicotine Polacrilex Gum for the twelve week program is about equal to what a person who smokes one and a half packs of cigarettes a day would spend on cigarettes for the same period of time.</p>
<p>Also, use of Nicotine Polacrilex Gum is only a short-term cost, while the cost of smoking is a long-term cost, because of the health problems smoking causes.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">6. What if I slip up?</span></p>
<p>Discard your cigarettes, forgive yourself and then get back on track. Don't consider yourself a failure or punish yourself. In fact, people who have already tried to quit are more likely to be successful the next time.</p>
