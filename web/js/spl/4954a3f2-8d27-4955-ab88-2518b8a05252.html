<p>‚Ä¢ Begin combing in a "scooping" motion: gently push the teeth as close to the scalp as possible and drag comb firmly and evenly from the scalp to the ends of the hair (newly-laid eggs are found near the roots of the hair so it is important to get the teeth very close to the scalp). Make sure the teeth are deeply embedded into the strands as you comb through.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Always comb away from the head.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Wipe eggs and nits from the teeth of the comb often with a tissue or paper towel.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Remove any remaining nits by hand (using a throw-away glove).</p>

<p><span class="Italics">Control completo de la pediculosis para su familia y el hogar</span></p>
<p>Paso 1: Tratar</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Champ√∫ para la pediculosis</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">V√©ase las instrucciones de m√°s abajo para calcular cu√°nto producto necesitar√°.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Inspeccione</span></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ revise a cada miembro de la familia con una lupa en un lugar con buena luz en busca de piojos/liendres (huevos).</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ busque peque√±as liendres cerca del cuero cabelludo, comenzando por la nuca y detr√°s de las orejas.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ examine peque√±as secciones de pelo a la vez.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ a diferencia de la caspa, que se mueve cuando uno la toca, las liendres est√°n adheridas al pelo.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ si encuentra piojos o liendres, tr√°telos con este producto.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">NOTA:</span></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Use toallas para proteger los ojos de los ni√±os durante el tratamiento y para que no se humedezca la ropa.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Aplique el champ√∫ para la pediculosis generosamente sobre el <span class="Bold">PELO SECO </span>o en otras √°reas afectadas.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Si humedece el pelo, el tratamiento se diluye y eso lo hace menos efectivo.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Adem√°s, los piojos pueden mantener la respiraci√≥n cuando est√°n sumergidos bajo el agua, lo que vuelve m√°s dif√≠cil que el ingrediente activo penetre a los piojos.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Para los piojos de la cabeza, masajee muy bien con el champ√∫ sobre el cuero cabelludo, detr√°s de las orejas y en la nuca. Los piojos pueden subir y bajar por el pelo muy r√°pido por lo que es importante aplicar el tratamiento desde las ra√≠ces hasta las puntas del pelo.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">Gel Removedor de Huevos y Liendres</span></p>
<p>Este producto debe utilizarse <span class="Bold">LUEGO </span>del Champ√∫ para la pediculosis (Paso 1). Remover los huevos y las liendres* es un <span class="Bold"><span class="Underline">paso esencial</span></span> para completar el control de la pediculosis.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">V√©ase las instrucciones de m√°s abajo para calcular cu√°nto producto necesitar√°.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">NOTA:</span></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Se debe usar un peine de dientes finos o un peine especial (incluido) para remover los piojos, los huevos y las liendres del pelo.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Antes de empezar tenga a mano:</p>
<p>- toallas extra,</p>
<p>- horquillas o hebillas para el pelo,</p>
<p>- pa√±uelos o toallas de papel,</p>
<p>- peine com√∫n para separar y desenredar el pelo,</p>
<p>- guantes descartables.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Busque una distracci√≥n para su hijo (por ejemplo, libros, televisi√≥n, juegos).</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Peine el pelo h√∫medo con un peine de dientes anchos para desenredarlo.</p>

</div>
<p>‚Ä¢ Aplique el Gel Removedor de Huevos y Liendres a una parte del pelo. (No aplique en toda la cabeza de una sola vez, ya que el gel se seca r√°pido).</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Masajee muy bien hasta que todo el pelo en esta secci√≥n est√© cubierto con el gel.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Cuando peine, use el peine fino suministrado y aseg√∫rese de que los dientes miren hacia usted.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Separe el pelo en secciones. Haga una secci√≥n a la vez partiendo desde la coronilla. El cabello m√°s largo puede demorar entre 1 y 2 horas.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Levante un peque√±o mech√≥n de pelo (alrededor de 1-2‚Ä? de ancho) de la secci√≥n con gel.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Comience a peinar con un movimiento ‚Äúde onda‚Ä?: suavemente coloque los dientes lo m√°s cerca posible del cuero cabelludo y arrastre el peine de manera firme y pareja desde el cuero cabelludo hasta las puntas del pelo (los huevos nuevos se encuentran cerca de las ra√≠ces del pelo por lo que es importante colocar los dientes muy cerca del cuero cabelludo). Aseg√∫rese de que los dientes est√©n bien incrustados en el pelo mientras peina.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Siempre peine hacia afuera de la cabeza.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Retire las liendres de los dientes del peine frecuentemente con un pa√±uelo o toalla de papel.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Quite las liendres restantes con la mano (usando un guante descartable).</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Tire todos los pa√±uelos o toallas en una bolsa de pl√°stico sellada y des√©chela de inmediato para evitar que los piojos regresen.</p>

</div>
<p>‚Ä¢ Mantenga el pelo h√∫medo mientras lo peina. Si el cabello se seca mientras lo peina, humed√©zcalo un poco con agua y vuelva a aplicar el Gel Removedor de Huevos y Liendres seg√∫n sea necesario.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Una vez que haya peinado y sujetado todo el cabello, quite todas las horquillas o hebillas y busque de nuevo minuciosamente las liendres. Vuelva a peinar si es necesario. Enjuague el pelo con abundante agua tibia. Si lo desea, tambi√©n puede lavar el cabello con un champ√∫ com√∫n.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Luego de pulverizar el √°rea infectada, pase la aspiradora en alfombras y tapetes. Arroje a la basura las bolsas de la aspiradora despu√©s de usarlas.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Lave ropas, toallas, sombreros lavables, bufandas, abrigos y s√°banas con agua caliente. S√©quelos a temperatura alta durante al menos 20 minutos.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Limpie en seco los art√≠culos no lavables.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Los peines y cepillos personales deben ser desinfectados sumergi√©ndolos en agua caliente (m√°s de 130¬∫ F) (54¬∫ C) durante al menos 10 minutos.</p>

<p>Verificaci√≥n Diaria</p>
<p><span class="Bold">PARA PREVENIR LA REINFECCI√ìN:</span></p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Inspeccione cuidadosamente al miembro de la familia infectado <span class="Bold">a diario</span> durante 2 semanas al menos. Si ve huevos o liendres, repita el Paso 2.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Revise a otros miembros de la familia y busque piojos de la cabeza. Si alguien de la familia est√° infectado, siga el Paso 1 y el Paso 2. Repita el Paso 3 con todos los art√≠culos u objetos con los que haya estado en contacto.</p>
<p>Segunda Aplicaci√≥n</p>
<p>Repita los mismos procedimientos dentro de los 7-10 d√≠as del</p>
<p>Paso 1: Tratar y del Paso 2: Remover</p>
<p>Puede haber algunos huevos que no hayan sido removidos durante el primer tratamiento.</p>
<p>Estos huevos eclosionar√°n y deben ser eliminados con el segundo tratamiento.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ los art√≠culos que no se pueden lavar (cubrecamas, mantas, almohadas, juguetes rellenos, etc.) deben ser lavados en seco o sellados en una bolsa pl√°stica durante 4 semanas, luego hay que sacarlos fuera de la casa y sacudirlos con fuerza antes de volver a usarlos.</p>
