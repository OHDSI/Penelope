Anyone considering the use of Fluoxetine Oral Solution, USP or any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber.

However, dosage adjustments should be made to maintain the patient on the lowest effective dosage, and patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for treatment.</p>

<h2>5.1 Clinical Worsening and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> Risk</h2>
<p class="First">Patients with Major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depressive Disorder</span> (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and/or the emergence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4092095" conceptname="Planning suicide">suicidal ideation</span> and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> is a known risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality)  in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18–24) with Major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depressive Disorder</span> (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.</p>
<p>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440374" conceptname="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">Obsessive Compulsive Disorder</span> (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug versus placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.</p>

<p>No <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>.</p>
<p>It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months.

If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate. Plasma fluoxetine and norfluoxetine concentration decrease gradually at the conclusion of therapy which may minimize the risk of discontinuation symptoms with this drug.</p>

<h2>6.1 Clinical Trials Experience</h2>
<p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect or predict the rates observed in practice.</p>
<p>Multiple doses of fluoxetine had been administered to 10,782 patients with various diagnoses in US clinical trials as of May 8, 1995. In addition, there have been 425 patients administered fluoxetine in panic clinical trials. Adverse reactions were recorded by clinical investigators using descriptive terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse reactions without first grouping similar types of reactions into a limited (i.e., reduced) number of standardized reaction categories.</p>
<p>In the tables and tabulations that follow, COSTART Dictionary terminology has been used to classify reported adverse reactions. The stated frequencies represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. It is important to emphasize that reactions reported during therapy were not necessarily caused by it.</p>
<p>The prescriber should be aware that the figures in the tables and tabulations cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side effect incidence rate in the population studied.</p>

The overall profile of adverse reactions was generally similar to that seen in adult studies, as shown in Tables 3 and 4. However, the following adverse reactions (excluding those which appear in the body or footnotes of Tables 3 and 4 and those for which the COSTART terms were uninformative or misleading) were reported at an incidence of at least 2% for fluoxetine and greater than placebo: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4241197" conceptname="Thirst">thirst</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4195305" conceptname="Hyperactive behavior">hyperkinesia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441838" conceptname="Personality disorder">personality disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318556" conceptname="Epistaxis">epistaxis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012368" conceptname="Increased frequency of urination">urinary frequency</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302555" conceptname="Menorrhagia">menorrhagia</span>.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Male and female <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4237140" conceptname="Abnormal sexual function">sexual dysfunction</span> with SSRIs</span> — Although changes in sexual desire, sexual performance, and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder, they may also be a consequence of pharmacologic treatment. In particular, some evidence suggests that SSRIs can cause such untoward sexual experiences. Reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance, and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, however, in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance, cited in product labeling, are likely to underestimate their actual incidence. In patients enrolled in US Major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depressive Disorder</span>, OCD, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438407" conceptname="Bulimia nervosa">bulimia</span> placebo-controlled clinical trials, decreased libido was the only sexual side effect reported by at least 2% of patients taking fluoxetine (4% fluoxetine, &lt;1% placebo).

<p>While it is difficult to know the precise risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4237140" conceptname="Abnormal sexual function">sexual dysfunction</span> associated with the use of SSRIs, physicians should routinely inquire about such possible side effects.</p>

<p>In a study of 19 healthy male subjects, which included 6 slow and 13 rapid hydroxylators of debrisoquin, a single 25 mg oral dose of thioridazine produced a 2.4-fold higher C<span class="Sub">max</span> and a 4.5-fold higher AUC for thioridazine in the slow hydroxylators compared with the rapid hydroxylators. The rate of debrisoquin hydroxylation is felt to depend on the level of CYP2D6 isozyme activity.

<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6</span>  –  Fluoxetine inhibits the activity of CYP2D6, and may make individuals with normal CYP2D6 metabolic activity resemble a poor metabolizer. Coadministration of fluoxetine with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6, including certain antidepressants (e.g., TCAs), antipsychotics (e.g., phenothiazines and most atypicals), and antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and others) should be approached with caution. Therapy with medications that are predominantly metabolized by the CYP2D6 system and that have a relatively narrow therapeutic index (see list below) should be initiated at the low end of the dose range if a patient is receiving fluoxetine concurrently or has taken it in the previous 5 weeks. Thus, his/her dosing requirements resemble those of poor metabolizers. If fluoxetine is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need for decreased dose of the original medication should be considered. Drugs with a narrow therapeutic index represent the greatest concern (e.g., flecainide, propafenone, vinblastine, and TCAs).

Physicians should note that in a prospective longitudinal study of 201 women with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4114950" conceptname="Endogenous depression">major depression</span> who were euthymic at the beginning of pregnancy, women who discontinued antidepressant medication during pregnancy were more likely to experience a relapse of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4114950" conceptname="Endogenous depression">major depression</span> than women who continued antidepressant medication.</p>
<p>The physician may consider tapering fluoxetine in the third trimester.</p>

<h2>8.2 Labor and Delivery</h2>
<p class="First">The effect of fluoxetine on labor and delivery in humans is unknown. However, because fluoxetine crosses the placenta and because of the possibility that fluoxetine may have adverse effects on the newborn, fluoxetine should be used during labor and delivery only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<p class="First">Because fluoxetine is excreted in human milk, nursing while on fluoxetine is not recommended. In one breast-milk sample, the concentration of fluoxetine plus norfluoxetine was 70.4 ng/mL. The concentration in the mother's plasma was 295.0 ng/mL. No adverse effects on the infant were reported.

<h2>8.4 Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">The efficacy of fluoxetine for the treatment of Major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depressive Disorder</span> was demonstrated in two 8- to 9-week placebo-controlled clinical trials with 315 pediatric outpatients ages 8 to ≤18 <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#S14.1">Clinical Studies (14.1)</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>The efficacy of fluoxetine for the treatment of OCD was demonstrated in one 13-week placebo-controlled clinical trial with 103 pediatric outpatients ages 7 to &lt;18 <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#S14.2">Clinical Studies (14.2)</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients &lt;8 years of age in Major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depressive Disorder</span> and &lt;7 years of age in OCD have not been established.</p>
<p>Fluoxetine pharmacokinetics were evaluated in 21 pediatric patients (ages 6 to ≤18) with Major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depressive Disorder</span> or OCD <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#S12.3">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>The acute adverse reaction profiles observed in the 3 studies (N=418 randomized; 228 fluoxetine-treated, 190 placebo-treated) were generally similar to that observed in adult studies with fluoxetine. The longer-term adverse reaction profile observed in the 19-week Major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depressive Disorder</span> study (N=219 randomized; 109 fluoxetine-treated, 110 placebo-treated) was also similar to that observed in adult trials with fluoxetine <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#S6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</a>]</span>.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">Manic reaction</span>, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">mania</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333678" conceptname="Hypomania">hypomania</span>, was reported in 6 (1 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">mania</span>, 5 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333678" conceptname="Hypomania">hypomania</span>) out of 228 (2.6%) fluoxetine-treated patients and in 0 out of 190 (0%) placebo-treated patients. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">Mania</span>/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333678" conceptname="Hypomania">hypomania</span> led to the discontinuation of 4 (1.8%) fluoxetine-treated patients from the acute phases of the 3 studies combined.

<p>As with other SSRIs, decreased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span> has been observed in association with the use of fluoxetine in children and adolescent patients. After 19 weeks of treatment in a clinical trial, pediatric subjects treated with fluoxetine gained an average of 1.1 cm less in height and 1.1 kg less in weight than subjects treated with placebo. In addition, fluoxetine treatment was associated with a decrease in alkaline phosphatase levels. The safety of fluoxetine treatment for pediatric patients has not been systematically assessed for chronic treatment longer than several months in duration. In particular, there are no studies that directly evaluate the longer-term effects of fluoxetine on the growth, development and maturation of children and adolescent patients. Therefore, height and weight should be monitored periodically in pediatric patients receiving fluoxetine. <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#S5.6">Warnings and Precautions (5.6)</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Fluoxetine is approved for use in pediatric patients with MDD and OCD <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#BOX">Box Warning</a> and <a href="#S5.1">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</a>]</span>. Anyone considering the use of fluoxetine in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need.</p>
<p>Significant toxicity, including myotoxicity, long-term neurobehavioral and reproductive toxicity, and impaired bone development, has been observed following exposure of juvenile animals to fluoxetine. Some of these effects occurred at clinically relevant exposures.</p>
<p>In a study in which fluoxetine (3, 10, or 30 mg/kg) was orally administered to young rats from weaning (Postnatal Day 21) through adulthood (Day 90), male and female sexual development was delayed at all doses, and growth (body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span>, femur length) was decreased during the dosing period in animals receiving the highest dose. At the end of the treatment period, serum levels of creatine kinase (marker of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4048093" conceptname="Hamstring injury">muscle damage</span>) were increased at the intermediate and high doses, and abnormal muscle and reproductive organ histopathology (skeletal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="78236" conceptname="Muscle atrophy">muscle degeneration</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280654" conceptname="Necrosis">necrosis</span>, testicular degeneration and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280654" conceptname="Necrosis">necrosis</span>, epididymal vacuolation and hypospermia) was observed at the high dose. When animals were evaluated after a recovery period (up to 11 weeks after cessation of dosing), neurobehavioral abnormalities (decreased reactivity at all doses and learning deficit at the high dose) and reproductive functional impairment (decreased mating at all doses and impaired fertility at the high dose) were seen; in addition, testicular and epididymal microscopic lesions and decreased sperm concentrations were found in the high dose group, indicating that the reproductive organ effects seen at the end of treatment were irreversible. The reversibility of fluoxetine-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4048093" conceptname="Hamstring injury">muscle damage</span> was not assessed. Adverse effects similar to those observed in rats treated with fluoxetine during the juvenile period have not been reported after administration of fluoxetine to adult animals. Plasma exposures (AUC) to fluoxetine in juvenile rats receiving the low, intermediate, and high dose in this study were approximately 0.1–0.2, 1–2, and 5–10 times, respectively, the average exposure in pediatric patients receiving the maximum recommended dose (MRD) of 20 mg/day. Rat exposures to the major metabolite, norfluoxetine, were approximately 0.3–0.8, 1–8, and 3–20 times, respectively, pediatric exposure at the MRD.</p>
<p>A specific effect of fluoxetine on bone development has been reported in mice treated with fluoxetine during the juvenile period. When mice were treated with fluoxetine (5 or 20 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) for 4 weeks starting at 4 weeks of age, bone formation was reduced resulting in decreased bone mineral content and density. These doses did not affect overall growth (body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span> or femoral length). The doses administered to juvenile mice in this study are approximately 0.5 and 2 times the MRD for pediatric patients on a body surface area (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) basis.</p>
<p>In another mouse study, administration of fluoxetine (10 mg/kg intraperitoneal) during early postnatal development (Postnatal Days 4 to 21) produced abnormal emotional behaviors (decreased exploratory behavior in elevated plus-maze, increase <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span> avoidance latency) in adulthood (12 weeks of age). The dose used in this study is approximately equal to the pediatric MRD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. Because of the early dosing period in this study, the significance of these findings to the approved pediatric use in humans is uncertain.</p>

<h2>10.1 Human Experience</h2>
<p class="First">Worldwide exposure to fluoxetine hydrochloride is estimated to be over 38 million patients (circa 1999). Of the 1578 cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> involving fluoxetine hydrochloride, alone or with other drugs, reported from this population, there were 195 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span>.</p>
<p>Among 633 adult patients who overdosed on fluoxetine hydrochloride alone, 34 resulted in a fatal outcome, 378 completely recovered, and 15 patients experienced sequelae after overdosage, including abnormal accommodation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437643" conceptname="Abnormal gait">abnormal gait</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, unresponsiveness, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436817" conceptname="Feeling nervous">nervousness</span>, pulmonary dysfunction, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439383" conceptname="Vertigo">vertigo</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span>, elevated blood pressure, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">impotence</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372604" conceptname="Movement disorder">movement disorder</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333678" conceptname="Hypomania">hypomania</span>.

The largest known ingestion of fluoxetine hydrochloride in adult patients was 8 grams in a patient who took fluoxetine alone and who subsequently recovered. However, in an adult patient who took fluoxetine alone, an ingestion as low as 520 mg has been associated with lethal outcome, but causality has not been established.</p>
<p>Among pediatric patients (ages 3 months to 17 years), there were 156 cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> involving fluoxetine alone or in combination with other drugs. Six patients died, 127 patients completely recovered, 1 patient experienced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span>, and 22 patients had an unknown outcome. One of the six fatalities was a 9-year-old boy who had a history of OCD, Tourette's syndrome with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4297396" conceptname="Tic">tics</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4149353" conceptname="Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, predominantly inattentive type">attention deficit disorder</span>, and fetal alcohol syndrome.

<h2>10.2 Animal Experience</h2>
<p class="First">Studies in animals do not provide precise or necessarily valid information about the treatment of human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. However, animal experiments can provide useful insights into possible treatment strategies.</p>
<p>The oral median lethal dose in rats and mice was found to be 452 and 248 mg/kg, respectively. Acute high oral doses produced hyperirritability and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> in several animal species.</p>
<p>Among 6 dogs purposely overdosed with oral fluoxetine, 5 experienced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="374924" conceptname="Generalized convulsive epilepsy">grand mal seizures</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">Seizures</span> stopped immediately upon the bolus intravenous administration of a standard veterinary dose of diazepam. In this short-term study, the lowest plasma concentration at which a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> occurred was only twice the maximum plasma concentration seen in humans taking 80 mg/day, chronically.</p>
<p>In a separate single-dose study, the ECG of dogs given high doses did not reveal prolongation of the PR, QRS, or QT intervals. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">Tachycardia</span> and an increase in blood pressure were observed. Consequently, the value of the ECG in predicting cardiac toxicity is unknown. Nonetheless, the ECG should ordinarily be monitored in cases of human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#S10.3">Overdosage (10.3)</a>]</span>.</p>

<h2>10.3 Management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">Overdose</span></h2>
<p class="First">Treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any drug effective in the treatment of Major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depressive Disorder</span>.</p>
<p>Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. General supportive and symptomatic measures are also recommended. Induction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> is not recommended. Gastric lavage with a large-bore orogastric tube with appropriate airway protection, if needed, may be indicated if performed soon after ingestion, or in symptomatic patients.</p>
<p>Activated charcoal should be administered. Due to the large volume of distribution of this drug, forced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span>, dialysis, hemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. No specific antidotes for fluoxetine are known.</p>
<p>A specific caution involves patients who are taking or have recently taken fluoxetine and might ingest excessive quantities of a TCA. In such a case, accumulation of the parent tricyclic and/or an active metabolite may increase the possibility of clinically significant sequelae and extend the time needed for close medical observation <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#S7.9">Drug Interactions (7. 9)</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Based on experience in animals, which may not be relevant to humans, fluoxetine-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> that fail to remit spontaneously may respond to diazepam.</p>
<p>In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement. The physician should consider contacting a poison control center for additional information on the treatment of any <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>.

<h2>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Although the exact mechanism of fluoxetine is unknown, it is presumed to be linked to its inhibition of CNS neuronal uptake of serotonin.</p>

<a name="S12.2"></a><a name="section-12.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>12.2 Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">Studies at clinically relevant doses in man have demonstrated that fluoxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. Studies in animals also suggest that fluoxetine is a much more potent uptake inhibitor of serotonin than of norepinephrine.</p>
<p>Antagonism of muscarinic, histaminergic, and α<span class="Sub">1</span>-adrenergic receptors has been hypothesized to be associated with various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular effects of classical tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) drugs. Fluoxetine binds to these and other membrane receptors from brain tissue much less potently <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> than do the tricyclic drugs.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Systemic Bioavailability</span> — In man, following a single oral 40 mg dose, peak plasma concentrations of fluoxetine from 15 to 55 ng/mL are observed after 6 to 8 hours.</p>
<p>The capsule, tablet, and oral solution dosage forms of fluoxetine are bioequivalent. Food does not appear to affect the systemic bioavailability of fluoxetine, although it may delay its absorption by 1 to 2 hours, which is probably not clinically significant. Thus, fluoxetine may be administered with or without food.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span> — Fluoxetine is extensively metabolized in the liver to norfluoxetine and a number of other unidentified metabolites. The only identified active metabolite, norfluoxetine, is formed by demethylation of fluoxetine. In animal models, <span class="Italics">S</span>-norfluoxetine is a potent and selective inhibitor of serotonin uptake and has activity essentially equivalent to <span class="Italics">R</span>- or <span class="Italics">S</span>-fluoxetine. <span class="Italics">R</span>-norfluoxetine is significantly less potent than the parent drug in the inhibition of serotonin uptake.

<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Variability in Metabolism</span> — A subset (about 7%) of the population has reduced activity of the drug metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Such individuals are referred to as "poor metabolizers" of drugs such as debrisoquin, dextromethorphan, and the TCAs. In a study involving labeled and unlabeled enantiomers administered as a racemate, these individuals metabolized <span class="Italics">S</span>-fluoxetine at a slower rate and thus achieved higher concentrations of <span class="Italics">S</span>-fluoxetine. Consequently, concentrations of <span class="Italics">S</span>-norfluoxetine at steady state were lower. The metabolism of <span class="Italics">R</span>-fluoxetine in these poor metabolizers appears normal. When compared with normal metabolizers, the total sum at steady state of the plasma concentrations of the 4 active enantiomers was not significantly greater among poor metabolizers. Thus, the net pharmacodynamic activities were essentially the same. Alternative, nonsaturable pathways (non-2D6) also contribute to the metabolism of fluoxetine. This explains how fluoxetine achieves a steady-state concentration rather than increasing without limit.</p>
<p>Because fluoxetine's metabolism, like that of a number of other compounds including TCAs and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), involves the CYP2D6 system, concomitant therapy with drugs also metabolized by this enzyme system (such as the TCAs) may lead to drug interactions <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#S7.9">Drug Interactions (7.9)</a>]</span>.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Accumulation and Slow Elimination</span>— The relatively slow elimination of fluoxetine (elimination half-life of 1 to 3 days after acute administration and 4 to 6 days after chronic administration) and its active metabolite, norfluoxetine (elimination half-life of 4 to 16 days after acute and chronic administration), leads to significant accumulation of these active species in chronic use and delayed attainment of steady state, even when a fixed dose is used <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (15.13)]</span>. After 30 days of dosing at 40 mg/day, plasma concentrations of fluoxetine in the range of 91 to 302 ng/mL and norfluoxetine in the range of 72 to 258 ng/mL have been observed. Plasma concentrations of fluoxetine were higher than those predicted by single-dose studies, because fluoxetine's metabolism is not proportional to dose. Norfluoxetine, however, appears to have linear pharmacokinetics. Its mean terminal half-life after a single dose was 8.6 days and after multiple dosing was 9.3 days. Steady-state levels after prolonged dosing are similar to levels seen at 4 to 5 weeks.</p>
<p>The long elimination half-lives of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine assure that, even when dosing is stopped, active drug substance will persist in the body for weeks (primarily depending on individual patient characteristics, previous dosing regimen, and length of previous therapy at discontinuation). This is of potential consequence when drug discontinuation is required or when drugs are prescribed that might interact with fluoxetine and norfluoxetine following the discontinuation of fluoxetine.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Liver Disease</span>— As might be predicted from its primary site of metabolism, liver impairment can affect the elimination of fluoxetine. The elimination half-life of fluoxetine was prolonged in a study of cirrhotic patients, with a mean of 7.6 days compared with the range of 2 to 3 days seen in subjects without liver disease; norfluoxetine elimination was also delayed, with a mean duration of 12 days for cirrhotic patients compared with the range of 7 to 9 days in normal subjects. This suggests that the use of fluoxetine in patients with liver disease must be approached with caution. If fluoxetine is administered to patients with liver disease, a lower or less frequent dose should be used <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#S2.5">Dosage and Administration (2.5)</a>, <a href="#S8.6">Use in Specific Populations (8.6)</a>]</span>.</p>

However, given the long half-life and nonlinear disposition of the drug, a single-dose study is not adequate to rule out the possibility of altered pharmacokinetics in the elderly, particularly if they have systemic illness or are receiving multiple drugs for concomitant diseases. The effects of age upon the metabolism of fluoxetine have been investigated in 260 elderly but otherwise healthy depressed patients (≥60 years of age) who received 20 mg fluoxetine for 6 weeks.

The average norfluoxetine steady-state concentrations in these children were 1.5-fold higher than in adolescents (195 and 113 ng/mL, respectively). These differences can be almost entirely explained by differences in weight. No gender-associated difference in fluoxetine pharmacokinetics was observed.
