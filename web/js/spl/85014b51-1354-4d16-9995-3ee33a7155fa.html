<h1><span class="Bold Underline">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:
</span></h1>
<p class="First">Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal drug with anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic properties. Its mode of action, like that of other anti-inflammatory drugs, is not known.</p>
<p>However, its therapeutic action is not due to pituitary-adrenal stimulation.</p>
<p>Indomethacin is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis <span class="Italics">In vitro. </span>Concentrations are reached during therapy which have been demonstrated to have an effect <span class="Italics">In vivo</span> as well. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> in animal models. Moreover, prostaglandins are known to be among the mediators of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span>. Since Indomethacin is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.</p>
<p>Indomethacin has been shown to be an effective anti-inflammatory agent, appropriate for long-term use in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437082" conceptname="Ankylosing spondylitis">ankylosing spondylitis</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80180" conceptname="Osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</span>.</p>
<p>Indomethacin affords relief of symptoms: it does not alter the progressive course of the underlying disease.</p>
<p>Indomethacin suppresses <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> as demonstrated by relief of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, and reduction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4082445" conceptname="Tenderness">tenderness</span>. Improvement in patients treated with Indomethacin for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> has been demonstrated by a reduction in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154927" conceptname="Joint swelling">joint swelling</span>, average number of joints involved, and morning <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4060220" conceptname="Stiff neck">stiffness</span>; by increased mobility as demonstrated by a decrease in walking time; and by improved functional capability as demonstrated by an increase in grip strength.</p>
<p>Indomethacin has been reported to diminish basal and C0<span class="Sub">2</span> stimulated cerebral blood flow in healthy volunteers following acute oral and intravenous administration. In one study, after one week of treatment with orally administered indomethacin, this effect on basal cerebral blood flow had disappeared. The clinical significance of this effect has not been established.</p>
<p>Indomethacin Extended-release capsules USP 75 mg are designed to release 25 mg of drug initially and the remaining 50 mg over approximately 12 hours (90% of dose absorbed by 12 hours). Plasma concentrations of indomethacin fluctuate less and are more sustained following administration of Indomethacin Extended-release Capsules USP 75 mg than following administration of 25 mg indomethacin capsules given at 4 to 6 hour Intervals. In multiple-dose comparisons, the mean daily steady state plasma level of indomethacin attained with daily administration of Indomethacin Extended-release Capsules USP 75 mg was indistinguishable from that following indomethacin 25 mg capsules given at 0, 6, and 12 hours daily. However, there was a significant difference in indomethacin plasma levels between the two dosage regimens especially after 12 hours.</p>
<p>Controlled clinical studies of safety and efficacy in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80180" conceptname="Osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</span> have shown that one capsule of Indomethacin Extended-release Capsules USP 75 mg was clinically comparable to one 25 mg indomethacin capsule t.i.d.; and in controlled clincal studies in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span>, one capsule of Indomethacin Extended-release Capsules USP 75 mg taken in the morning and one in the evening were clinically indistinguishable from one 50 mg capsule of indomethacin t.i.d..</p>
<p>Indomethacin is eliminated via renal excretion, metabolism, and biliary excretion. Indomethacin undergoes appreciable enterohepatic circulation. The mean half-life of indomethacin is estimated to be about 4.5 hours. With a typical therapeutic regimen of 25 or 50 mg t.i.d., the steady state plasma concentrations of indomethacin are an average 1.4 times those following the first dose.</p>
<p>Indomethacin exists in the plasma as the parent drug and its desmethyl, desbenzoyl, and desmethyl-desbenzoyl metabolites, all in the unconjugated form. About 60 percent of an oral dosage is recovered in urine as drug and metabolites (26 percent as indomethacin and its glucuronide), and 33 percent is recovered in feces (1.5 percent as indomethacin).</p>
<p>About 99% of indomethacin is bound to protein in plasma over the expected range of therapeutic plasma concentrations. Indomethacin has been found to cross the blood-brain barrier and the placenta.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold Underline">INDICATIONS AND USAGE:
</span></h1>
<p class="First">Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of Indomethacin Extended-release Capsules USP 75 mg and other treatment options before deciding to use Indomethacin Extended-release Capsule USP 75 mg. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#bac7a54d-c264-4074-8ad7-083fb987837a">WARNINGS</a></span>).</p>
<p>Indomethacin Extended-release Capsules USP 75 mg has been found effective in active stages of the following:</p>
<p>1. Moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> including acute flares of chronic disease.</p>
<p>2. Moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437082" conceptname="Ankylosing spondylitis">ankylosing spondylitis</span>.</p>
<p>3. Moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80180" conceptname="Osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</span>.</p>
<p>4. Acute painful shoulder (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134453" conceptname="Bursitis">bursitis</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77081" conceptname="Tibialis tendinitis">tendinitis</span>).</p>
<p>Indomethacin Extended-release Capsules USP 75 mg are not recommended for the treatment of acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="74892" conceptname="Articular gout">gouty arthritis</span>.</p>
<p>Indomethacin may enable the reduction of steroid dosage in patients receiving steroids for the more severe forms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span>. In such instances the steroid dosage should be reduced slowly and the patients followed very closely for any possible adverse effects.</p>
<p>The use of indomethacin in conjunction with aspirin or other salicylates is not recommended. Controlled clinical studies have shown that the combined use of indomethacin and aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of indomethacin alone. Furthermore, in one of these clinical studies, the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects was significantly increased with combined therapy.

<h3><span class="Bold">Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events
</span></h3>
<p class="First">Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with a NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</p>
<p>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and a NSAID does increase the risk of serious Gl events (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#b837a452-109a-4acc-a9af-f40acec57d36">Gl WARNINGS</a></span>).</p>

These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper Gl adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper Gl <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcers</span>, gross <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2-4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious Gl event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk.</p>
<p>NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcer</span> disease or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">gastrointestinal bleeding</span>.

Other factors that increase the risk for Gl <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal Gl events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.</p>
<p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse Gl event in patients treated with a NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of Gl ulceration and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious Gl adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious Gl adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.</p>

<p class="First">Indomethacin Extended-release Capsules cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold">Hepatic Effects
</span></h3>
<p class="First">Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including Indomethacin Extended-release Capsules. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with continuing therapy. Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately three or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of hepatic reactions, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span> and fetal fulminant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4337543" conceptname="Hepatic necrosis">liver necrosis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic failure</span>, some of them with fatal outcomes have been reported.</p>
<p>A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with Indomethacin Extended-release Capsules. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302954" conceptname="Disorder characterized by eosinophilia">eosinophilia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>, etc.), Indomethacin- Extended release Capsules should be discontinued.</p>

<h4><span class="Bold Italics">Furosemide
</span></h4>
<p class="First">Clinical studies, as well as post marketing observations, have shown that Indomethacin Extended-release Capsules can reduce the natriuretic effect-of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#bac7a54d-c264-4074-8ad7-083fb987837a">WARNINGS</a></span><span class="Bold">, </span><span class="Bold"><a href="#bda5b178-a6d3-496e-8165-43b98589a2d1">Renal Effects</a></span>), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold Underline">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:
</span></h1>
<p class="First">Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of Indomethacin Extended-release Capsules and other treatment options before deciding to use Indomethacin Extended-release Capsules. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#bac7a54d-c264-4074-8ad7-083fb987837a">WARNINGS</a></span>).<br>Indomethacin Extended-release Capsules USP 75 mg are available for oral use. Indomethacin Extended-release Capsules USP 75 mg can be administered once a day and can be substituted for indomethacin 25 mg capsules t.i.d. However, there will be significant difference between the two dosage regimens in indomethacin blood levels, especially after 12 hours (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#bb41c62d-2228-4166-88be-f794ff68fb8a">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span>). In addition, Indomethacin Extended-release Capsules USP 75 mg b.i.d. can be substituted for indomethacin 50 mg capsules t.i.d. Indomethacin Extended-release Capsules USP 75 mg may be substituted for all the indications of indomethacin capsules except acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="74892" conceptname="Articular gout">gouty arthritis</span>. <br>Adverse reactions appear to correlate with the size of the dose of indomethacin in most patients, but not all. Therefore, every effort should be made to determine the smallest effective dosage for the individual patient.<br> Always give Indomethacin Extended-release Capsules USP 75 mg with food, immediately after meals, or with antacids to reduce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002232" conceptname="Epigastric discomfort">gastric irritation</span>. <br><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use:</span> Indomethacin Extended-release Capsules USP 75 mg ordinarily should not be prescribed for children 14 years of age and under (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#bac7a54d-c264-4074-8ad7-083fb987837a">WARNINGS</a></span>). <br><span class="Bold">Adult Use: </span>Dosage Recommendations for Active Stages of the Following:<br>1.     Moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span>, including acute flares of chronic<br>disesase; moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437082" conceptname="Ankylosing spondylitis">ankylosing spondylitis</span>; and moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80180" conceptname="Osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</span>. <br>The following information is provided as background only and refers to immediate-release indomethacin capsules (25 mg or 50 mg):  <br><span class="Underline">Suggested Dosage:</span><span class="Underline"><br></span>The following recommendations on dosing pertain to immediate-release indomethacin capsules USP, and provide important information regarding the dosage and administration of indomethacin. The prescriber should be aware of this information when considering and prescribing Indomethacin Extended-release Capsules USP 75 mg.<br>Indomethacin capsules 25 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. If this is well tolerated, increase the daily dosage by 25 or 50 mg, if required by continuing symptoms, at weekly intervals until a satisfactory response is obtained or until a total daily dose of 150-200 mg is reached. DOSES ABOVE THIS AMOUNT GENERALLY DO NOT INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DRUG. <br>In patients who have persistent night <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> and/or morning <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4060220" conceptname="Stiff neck">stiffness</span>, the giving of a large    portion, up to a maximum of 100 mg, of the total daily dose at bedtime, either orally or     by rectal suppositories, may be helpful in affording relief. The total daily dose should not     exceed 200 mg. In acute flares of chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span>, it may be necessary to    increase the dosage by 25 mg or, if required, by 50 mg daily.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">The following information refers to Indomethacin Extended-release Capsules USP 75 mg:</span><span class="Underline"><br></span>If Indomethacin Extended-release Capsules USP 75 mg are used for initiating indomethacin treatment, one capsule daily should be the usual starting dose in order to   observe patient tolerance since 75 mg per day is the maximum recommended starting    dose for indomethacin (see above). If Indomethacin Extended-release Capsules USP 75 mg are used to increase the daily dose, patients should be observed for possible signs and symptoms of intolerance since the daily increment will exceed the daily increment recommended for other dosage forms. For patients who require 150 mg of indomethacin per day and have demonstrated acceptable tolerance, Indomethacin Extended-release Capsules USP 75 mg may be prescribed as one capsule twice daily.</p>
<p>If minor adverse effects develop as the dosage is increased, reduce the dosage rapidly to a tolerated dose and OBSERVE THE PATIENT CLOSELY. <br>If severe adverse reactions occur, STOP THE DRUG. After the acute phase of the disease is under control, an attempt to reduce the daily dose should be made repeatedly until the patient is receiving the smallest effective dose or the drug is discontinued. <br>Careful instructions to, and observations of, the individual patient are essential to the prevention of serious, irreversible, including fatal, adverse reactions. <br>As advancing years appear to increase the possibility of adverse reactions, Indomethacin Extended-release Capsules should be used with greater care in the aged.<br>2.
