<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">OGEN (estropipate vaginal cream, USP), (formerly piperazine estrone sulfate), is a natural estrogenic substance prepared from purified crystalline estrone, solubilized as the sulfate and stabilized with piperazine. It is appreciably soluble in water and has almost no odor or taste. The amount of piperazine in OGEN is not sufficient to exert a pharmacological action. Its addition ensures solubility, stability, and uniform potency of the estrone sulfate. Chemically estropipate, molecular weight: 436.56, is represented by estra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-one,3-(sulfooxy)-, compound with piperazine (1:1). The structural formula may be represented as follows:</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Estrogen drug products act by regulating the transcription of a limited number of genes. Estrogens diffuse through cell membranes, distribute themselves throughout the cell, and bind to and activate the nuclear estrogen receptor, a DNA-binding protein which is found in estrogen-responsive tissues. The activated estrogen receptor binds to specific DNA sequences, or hormone-response elements, which enhance the transcription of adjacent genes and in turn lead to the observed effects. Estrogen receptors have been identified in tissues of the reproductive tract, breast, pituitary, hypothalamus, liver, and bone of women.</p>
<p>Estrogens are important in the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sex characteristics. By a direct action, they cause growth and development of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and vagina. With other hormones, such as pituitary hormones and progesterone, they cause enlargement of the breasts through promotion of ductal growth, stromal development, and the accretion of fat. Estrogens are intricately involved with other hormones, especially progesterone, in the processes of the ovulatory menstrual cycle and pregnancy, and affect the release of pituitary gonadotropins. They also contribute to the shaping of the skeleton, maintenance of tone and elasticity of urogenital structures, changes in the epiphyses of the long bones that allow for the pubertal growth spurt and its termination, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4083855" conceptname="Abnormal pigment">pigmentation</span> of the nipples and genitals.</p>
<p>Estrogens occur naturally in several forms. The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 micrograms of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. This is converted primarily to estrone, which circulates in roughly equal proportion to estradiol, and to small amounts of estriol. After <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span>, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone by peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone – especially in its sulfate ester form – is the most abundant circulating estrogen in postmenopausal women. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than estrone or estriol at the receptor.</p>
<p>Estrogens used in therapy are well absorbed through the skin, mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal tract. When applied for a local action, absorption is usually sufficient to cause systemic effects. When conjugated with aryl and alkyl groups for parenteral administration, the rate of absorption of oily preparations is slowed with a prolonged duration of action, such that a single intramuscular injection of estradiol valerate or estradiol cypionate is absorbed over several weeks.</p>
<p>Administered estrogens and their esters are handled within the body essentially the same as the endogenous hormones. Metabolic conversion of estrogens occurs primarily in the liver (first pass effect), but also at local target tissue sites. Complex metabolic processes result in a dynamic equilibrium of circulating conjugated and unconjugated estrogenic forms which are continually interconverted, especially between estrone and estradiol and between esterified and unesterified forms. Although naturally-occurring estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to sex hormone-binding globulin and albumin, only unbound estrogens enter target tissue cells. A significant proportion of the circulating estrogen exists as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogenic species. A certain proportion of the estrogen is excreted into the bile and then reabsorbed from the intestine. During this enterohepatic recirculation, estrogens are desulfated and resulfated and undergo degradation through conversion to less active estrogens (estriol and other estrogens), oxidation to nonestrogenic substances (catecholestrogens, which interact with catecholamine metabolism, especially in the central nervous system), and conjugation with glucuronic acids (which are then rapidly excreted in the urine).</p>
<p>When given orally, naturally-occurring estrogens and their esters are extensively metabolized (first pass effect) and circulate primarily as estrone sulfate, with smaller amounts of other conjugated and unconjugated estrogenic species. This results in limited oral potency. By contrast, synthetic estrogens, such as ethinyl estradiol and the nonsteroidal estrogens, are degraded very slowly in the liver and other tissues, which results in their high intrinsic potency. Estrogen drug products administered by non-oral routes are not subject to first-pass metabolism, but also undergo significant hepatic uptake, metabolism, and enterohepatic recycling.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-6.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>1. Induction of malignant neoplasms</h2>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-6.1.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Endometrial cancer</h3>
<p class="First">The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 fold greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than one year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use – with increased risks of 15 to 24-fold for five to ten years or more. In three studies, persistence of risk was demonstrated for 8 to over 15 years after cessation of estrogen treatment. In one study a significant decrease in the incidence of endometrial cancer occurred six months after estrogen withdrawal. Concurrent progestin therapy may offset this risk but the overall health impact in postmenopausal women is not known (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#precautions">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>).</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-6.1.2"></a><p></p>
<h3>Breast Cancer</h3>
<p class="First">While the majority of studies have not shown an increased risk of breast cancer in women who have ever used estrogen replacement therapy, some have reported a moderately increased risk (relative risks of 1.3–2.0) in those taking higher doses or those taking lower doses for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4088438" conceptname="Prolonged periods">prolonged periods</span> of time, especially in excess of 10 years. Other studies have not shown this relationship.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-6.1.3"></a><p></p>
<h3>Congenital lesions with malignant potential</h3>
<p class="First">Estrogen therapy during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of fetal congenital <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4179871" conceptname="Disorder of reproductive system">reproductive tract disorders</span>, and possibly other <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span>. Studies of women who received DES during pregnancy have shown that female offspring have an increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242227" conceptname="Vaginal adenosis">vaginal adenosis</span>, squamous cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4093447" conceptname="Dysplasia">dysplasia</span> of the uterine cervix, and clear cell vaginal cancer later in life; male offspring have an increased risk of urogenital abnormalities and possibly testicular cancer later in life. Although some of these changes are benign, others are precursors of malignancy.</p>

<h2>2. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192353" conceptname="Disorder of gallbladder">Gallbladder disease</span></h2>
<p class="First">Two studies have reported a 2- to 4-fold increase in the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192353" conceptname="Disorder of gallbladder">gallbladder disease</span> requiring surgery in women receiving postmenopausal estrogens.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-6.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>3. Cardiovascular disease</h2>
<p class="First">Large doses of estrogen (5 mg conjugated estrogens per day), comparable to those used to treat cancer of the prostate and breast, have been shown in a large prospective clinical trial in men to increase the risks of nonfatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440417" conceptname="Pulmonary embolism">pulmonary embolism</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320741" conceptname="Thrombophlebitis">thrombophlebitis</span>. These risks cannot necessarily be extrapolated from men to women. However, to avoid the theoretical cardiovascular risk to women caused by high estrogen doses, the dose for estrogen replacement therapy should not exceed the lowest effective dose.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-6.4"></a><p></p>
<h2>4. Elevated blood pressure</h2>
<p class="First">Occasional blood pressure increases during estrogen replacement therapy have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. More often, blood pressure has remained the same or has dropped. One study showed that postmenopausal estrogen users have higher blood pressure than nonusers. Two other studies showed slightly lower blood pressure among estrogen users compared to nonusers. Postmenopausal estrogen use does not increase the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>. Nonetheless, blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen use.</p>

<a name="section-7.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>A. General</h2>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-7.1.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>1. Addition of a progestin</h3>
<p class="First">Studies of the addition of a progestin for seven or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration have reported a lowered incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200775" conceptname="Endometrial hyperplasia">endometrial hyperplasia</span> which would otherwise be induced by estrogen treatment. Morphological and biochemical studies of endometrium suggest that 10 to 14 days of progestin are needed to provide maximal maturation of the endometrium and to eliminate any hyperplastic changes. There are possible additional risks which may be associated with the inclusion of progestins in estrogen replacement regimens. These include: (1) adverse effects on lipoprotein metabolism (lowering HDL and raising LDL) which may diminish the possible cardioprotective effect of estrogen therapy (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#precautions_D4">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>, D.4., below); (2) impairment of glucose tolerance; and (3) possible enhancement of mitotic activity in breast epithelial tissue (although few epidemiological data are available to address this point). The choice of progestin, its dose, and its regimen may be important in minimizing these adverse effects, but these issues remain to be clarified.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-7.1.2"></a><p></p>
<h3>2. Physical examination</h3>
<p class="First">A complete medical and family history should be taken prior to the initiation of any estrogen therapy. The pretreatment and periodic physical examinations should include special reference to blood pressure, breasts, abdomen, and pelvic organs, and should include a Papanicolaou smear. As a general rule, estrogen should not be prescribed for longer than one year without reexamining the patient.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-7.1.3"></a><p></p>
<h3>3. Hypercoagulability</h3>
<p class="First">Some studies have shown that women taking estrogen replacement therapy have hypercoagulability, primarily related to decreased antithrombin activity. This effect appears dose- and duration-dependent and is less pronounced than that associated with oral contraceptive use. Also, postmenopausal women tend to have increased coagulation parameters at baseline compared to premenopausal women. There is some suggestion that low dose postmenopausal mestranol may increase the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4159647" conceptname="Thromboembolic disorder">thromboembolism</span>, although the majority of studies (of primarily conjugated estrogens users) report no such increase. There is insufficient information on hypercoagulability in women who have had previous thromboembolic disease.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<p>This leaflet describes when and how to use estrogens, and the risks and benefits of estrogen treatment.</p>
<p>Estrogens have important benefits but also some risks. You must decide, with your doctor, whether the risks to you of estrogen use are acceptable because of their benefits. If you use estrogens, check with your doctor to be sure you are using the lowest possible dose that works, and that you don't use them longer than necessary. How long you need to use estrogens will depend on the reason for use.</p>

<h2>WARNINGS</h2>
<p class="First">ESTROGENS INCREASE THE RISK OF CANCER OF THE UTERUS IN WOMEN WHO HAVE HAD THEIR <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">MENOPAUSE</span> ("CHANGE OF LIFE").</p>
<p>If you use any estrogen-containing drug, it is important to visit your doctor regularly and report any unusual <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129155" conceptname="Vaginal bleeding">vaginal bleeding</span> right away. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129155" conceptname="Vaginal bleeding">Vaginal bleeding</span> after <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span> may be a warning sign of uterine cancer. Your doctor should evaluate any unusual <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129155" conceptname="Vaginal bleeding">vaginal bleeding</span> to find out the cause.</p>
<p>ESTROGENS SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING PREGNANCY.</p>
<p>Estrogens do not prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4067106" conceptname="Miscarriage">miscarriage</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4067106" conceptname="Miscarriage">spontaneous abortion</span>) and are not needed in the days following childbirth. If you take estrogens during pregnancy, your unborn child has a greater than usual chance of having <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span>. The risk of developing these defects is small, but clearly larger than the risk in children whose mothers did not take estrogens during pregnancy. These <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span> may affect the baby's urinary system and sex organs. Daughters born to mothers who took DES (an estrogen drug) have a higher than usual chance of developing cancer of the vagina or cervix when they become teenagers or young adults. Sons may have a higher than usual chance of developing cancer of the testicles when they become teenagers or young adults.</p>

<h2>USES OF ESTROGEN</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">(Not every estrogen drug is approved for every use listed in this section.</span> If you want to know which of these possible uses are approved for the medicine prescribed for you, ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you the professional labeling. You can also look up the specific estrogen product in a book called the "Physicians' Desk Reference," which is available in many book stores and public libraries. Generic drugs carry virtually the same labeling information as their brand name versions.)</p>
<p><span class="Bold">+ To reduce moderate or severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439082" conceptname="Menopausal syndrome">menopausal symptoms</span>.</span> Estrogens are hormones made by the ovaries of normal women. Between ages 45 and 55, the ovaries normally stop making estrogens. This leads to a drop in body estrogen levels which causes the "change of life" or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span> (the end of monthly menstrual periods). If both ovaries are removed during an operation before natural <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span> takes place, the sudden drop in estrogen levels causes "<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440155" conceptname="Postartificial menopausal syndrome">surgical menopause</span>."</p>
<p>When the estrogen levels begin dropping, some women develop very uncomfortable symptoms, such as feelings of warmth in the face, neck, and chest, or sudden intense episodes of heat and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span> ("<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113666" conceptname="Menopausal flushing">hot flashes</span>" or "<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113666" conceptname="Menopausal flushing">hot flushes</span>"). Using estrogen drugs can help the body adjust to lower estrogen levels and reduce these symptoms. Most women have only mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439082" conceptname="Menopausal syndrome">menopausal symptoms</span> or none at all and do not need to use estrogen drugs for these symptoms. Others may need to take estrogens for a few months while their bodies adjust to lower estrogen levels. The majority of women do not need estrogen replacement for longer than six months for these symptoms.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">+ To treat vulval and vaginal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4028206" conceptname="Atrophy">atrophy</span></span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302654" conceptname="Itching">itching</span>, burning, dryness in or around the vagina, difficulty or burning on urination) associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">+ To treat certain conditions in which a young woman's ovaries do not produce enough estrogen naturally.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">+ To treat certain types of abnormal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129155" conceptname="Vaginal bleeding">vaginal bleeding</span> due to hormonal imbalance when your doctor has found no serious cause of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">+ To treat certain cancers in special situations, in men and women.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">+ To prevent thinning of bones.</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">Osteoporosis</span> is a thinning of the bones that makes them weaker and allows them to break more easily. The bones of the spine, wrists and hips break most often in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span>. Both men and women start to lose bone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> after about age 40, but women lose bone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> faster after the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span>. Using estrogens after the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span> slows down bone thinning and may prevent bones from breaking. Lifelong adequate calcium intake, either in the diet (such as dairy products) or by calcium supplements (to reach a total daily intake of 1000 milligrams per day before <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span> or 1500 milligrams per day after <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span>), may help to prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span>. Regular weight-bearing exercise (like walking and running for an hour, two or three times a week) may also help to prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span>. Before you change your calcium intake or exercise habits, it is important to discuss these lifestyle changes with your doctor to find out if they are safe for you.</p>
<p>Since estrogen use has some risks, only women who are likely to develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> should use estrogens for prevention. Women who are likely to develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> often have the following characteristics: white or Asian race, slim, cigarette smokers, and a family history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> in a mother, sister, or aunt. Women who have relatively early <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span>, often because their ovaries were removed during an operation ("<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440155" conceptname="Postartificial menopausal syndrome">surgical menopause</span>"), are more likely to develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> than women whose <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span> happens at the average age.</p>
<p><br><span class="Bold">WHO SHOULD NOT USE ESTROGENS</span></p>
<p>Estrogens should not be used:</p>
<p><span class="Bold">+ During pregnancy (see boxed <a href="#boxed_warning2">WARNING</a>).</span> If you think you may be pregnant, do not use any form of estrogen-containing drug. Using estrogens while you are pregnant may cause your unborn child to have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span>. Estrogens do not prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4067106" conceptname="Miscarriage">miscarriage</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">+ If you have unusual <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129155" conceptname="Vaginal bleeding">vaginal bleeding</span> which has not been evaluated by your doctor (see boxed <a href="#boxed_warning2">WARNING</a>).</span> Unusual <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129155" conceptname="Vaginal bleeding">vaginal bleeding</span> can be a warning sign of cancer of the uterus, especially if it happens after <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span>. Your doctor must find out the cause of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> so that he or she can recommend the proper treatment. Taking estrogens without visiting your doctor can cause you serious harm if your <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129155" conceptname="Vaginal bleeding">vaginal bleeding</span> is caused by cancer of the uterus.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">+ If you have had cancer.</span> Since estrogens increase the risk of certain types of cancer, you should not use estrogens if you have ever had cancer of the breast or uterus, unless your doctor recommends that the drug may help in the cancer treatment. (For certain patients with breast or prostate cancer, estrogens may help.)</p>
<p><span class="Bold">+ If you have any circulation problems.</span> Estrogen drugs should not be used except in unusually special situations in which your doctor judges that you need estrogen therapy so much that the risks are acceptable. Men and women with abnormal blood clotting conditions should avoid estrogen use (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#dangers">DANGERS OF ESTROGENS</a></span>, below).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">+ When they do not work.</span> During <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span>, some women develop nervous symptoms or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>. Estrogens do not relieve these symptoms. You may have heard that taking estrogens for years after <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span> will keep your skin soft and supple and keep you feeling young. There is no evidence for these claims and such long-term estrogen use may have serious risks.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">+ After childbirth or when breastfeeding a baby.</span> Estrogens should not be used to try to stop the breasts from filling with milk after a baby is born. Such treatment may increase the risk of developing blood clots (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#dangers">DANGERS OF ESTROGENS</a></span>, below).</p>
<p>If you are breastfeeding, you should avoid using any drugs because many drugs pass through to the baby in the milk. While nursing a baby, you should take drugs only on the advice of your health care provider.</p>
<p><a name="dangers"></a><br><span class="Bold">DANGERS OF ESTROGENS</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">+ Cancer of the uterus.</span> Your risk of developing cancer of the uterus gets higher the longer you use estrogens and the larger doses you use. One study showed that after women stop taking estrogens, this higher cancer risk quickly returns to the usual level of risk (as if you had never used estrogen therapy). Three other studies showed that the cancer risk stayed high for 8 to more than 15 years after stopping estrogen treatment. <span class="Bold">Because of this risk, IT IS IMPORTANT TO TAKE THE LOWEST DOSE THAT WORKS AND TO TAKE IT ONLY AS LONG AS YOU NEED IT.</span></p>
<p>Using progestin therapy together with estrogen therapy may reduce the higher risk of uterine cancer related to estrogen use (but see <span class="Bold"><a href="#other">OTHER INFORMATION</a></span>, below).</p>
<p>If you have had your uterus removed (total hysterectomy), there is no danger of developing cancer of the uterus.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">+ Cancer of the breast.</span> Most studies have not shown a higher risk of breast cancer in women who have ever used estrogens. However, some studies have reported that breast cancer developed more often (up to twice the usual rate) in women who used estrogens for long periods of time (especially more than 10 years), or who used higher doses for shorter time periods.</p>
<p>Regular breast examinations by a health professional and monthly self-examination are recommended for all women.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">+ <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192353" conceptname="Disorder of gallbladder">Gallbladder disease</span>.</span> Women who use estrogens after <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span> are more likely to develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192353" conceptname="Disorder of gallbladder">gallbladder disease</span> needing surgery than women who do not use estrogens.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">+ Abnormal blood clotting.</span> Taking estrogens may cause changes in your blood clotting system. These changes allow the blood to clot more easily, possibly allowing clots to form in your bloodstream. If blood clots do form in your bloodstream, they can cut off the blood supply to vital organs, causing serious problems. These problems may include a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> (by cutting off blood to the brain), a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</span> (by cutting off blood to the heart), a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440417" conceptname="Pulmonary embolism">pulmonary embolus</span> (by cutting off blood to the lungs), or other problems. Any of these conditions may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> or serious long-term <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052648" conceptname="Disability">disability</span>. However, most studies of low dose estrogen usage by women do not show an increased risk of these complications.</p>
<p><br><span class="Bold">SIDE EFFECTS</span></p>

<p><br><span class="Bold">REDUCING RISK OF ESTROGEN USE</span></p>
<p>If you use estrogens, you can reduce your risks by doing these things:</p>
<p><span class="Bold">+ See your doctor regularly.</span> While you are using estrogens, it is important to visit your doctor at least once a year for a check-up. If you develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129155" conceptname="Vaginal bleeding">vaginal bleeding</span> while taking estrogens, you may need further evaluation. If members of your family have had breast cancer or if you have ever had <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80767" conceptname="Breast lump">breast lumps</span> or an abnormal mammogram (breast X-ray), you may need to have more frequent breast examinations.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">+ Reassess your need for estrogens.</span> You and your doctor should reevaluate whether or not you still need estrogens at least every six months.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">+ Be alert for signs of trouble.</span> If any of these warning signals (or any other unusual symptoms) happen while you are using estrogens, call your doctor immediately:</p>

<p><a name="other"></a><br><span class="Bold">OTHER INFORMATION</span></p>
<p>Some doctors may choose to prescribe a progestin, a different hormonal drug, for you to take together with your estrogen treatment. Progestins lower your risk of developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200775" conceptname="Endometrial hyperplasia">endometrial hyperplasia</span> (a possible pre-cancerous condition of the uterus) while using estrogens. Taking estrogens and progestins together may also protect you from the higher risk of uterine cancer, but this has not been clearly established. Combined use of progestin and estrogen treatment may have additional risks, however.
