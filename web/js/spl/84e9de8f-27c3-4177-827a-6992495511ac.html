<h2>Atenolol and Chlorthalidone</h2>
<p class="First">Atenolol and chlorthalidone have been used singly and concomitantly for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>. The antihypertensive effects of these agents are additive, and studies have shown that there is no interference with bioavailability when these agents are given together in the single combination tablet. Therefore, this combination provides a convenient formulation for the concomitant administration of these two entities. In patients with more severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, atenolol and chlorthalidone may be administered with other antihypertensives such as vasodilators.</p>

<h2>Atenolol</h2>
<p class="First">Atenolol is a beta<span class="Sub">1</span>-selective (cardioselective) beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent without membrane stabilizing or intrinsic sympathomimetic (partial agonist) activities. This preferential effect is not absolute, however, and at higher doses, atenolol inhibits beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenoreceptors, chiefly located in the bronchial and vascular musculature.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="LINK_c139413d-d14a-4dc6-8f0e-6f1dedd2bdc7"></a><a name="section-2.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">In standard animal or human pharmacological tests, beta-adrenoreceptor blocking activity of atenolol has been demonstrated by: 1) reduction in resting and exercise heart rates and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span>, 2) reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest and on exercise, 3) inhibition of isoproterenol induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span> and 4) reduction in reflex orthostatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>.</p>
<p>A significant beta-blocking effect of atenolol, as measured by reduction of exercise <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, is apparent within one hour following oral administration of a single dose. This effect is maximal at about 2 to 4 hours and persists for at least 24 hours. The effect at 24 hours is dose related and also bears a linear relationship to the logarithm of plasma atenolol concentration. However, as has been shown for all beta-blocking agents, the antihypertensive effect does not appear to be related to plasma level.</p>
<p>In normal subjects, the beta<span class="Sub">1</span>-selectivity of atenolol has been shown by its reduced ability to reverse the beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-mediated vasodilating effect of isoproterenol as compared to equivalent beta-blocking doses of propranolol. In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatic</span> patients, a dose of atenolol producing a greater effect on resting heart rate than propranolol resulted in much less increase in airway resistance. In a placebo-controlled comparison of approximately equipotent oral doses of several beta blockers, atenolol produced a significantly smaller decrease of FEV<span class="Sub">1</span> than nonselective beta blockers, such as propranolol and unlike those agents did not inhibit bronchodilation in response to isoproterenol.</p>
<p>Consistent with its negative chronotropic effect due to beta blockade of the SA node, atenolol increases sinus cycle length and sinus node recovery time. Conduction in the AV node is also prolonged. Atenolol is devoid of membrane stabilizing activity, and increasing the dose well beyond that producing beta blockade does not further depress myocardial contractility. Several studies have demonstrated a moderate (approximately 10%) increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4231869" conceptname="Stroke volume">stroke volume</span> at rest and exercise.</p>
<p>In controlled clinical trials, atenolol given as a single daily dose, was an effective antihypertensive agent providing 24-hour reduction of blood pressure. Atenolol has been studied in combination with thiazide-type diuretics and the blood pressure effects of the combination are approximately additive. Atenolol is also compatible with methyldopa, hydralazine and prazosin, the combination resulting in a larger <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314171" conceptname="Low blood pressure reading">fall in blood pressure</span> than with the single agents. The dose range of atenolol is narrow, and increasing the dose beyond 100 mg once daily is not associated with increased antihypertensive effect. The mechanisms of the antihypertensive effects of beta-blocking agents have not been established. Several mechanisms have been proposed and include: 1) competitive antagonism of catecholamines at peripheral (especially cardiac) adrenergic neuron sites, leading to decreased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span>, 2) a central effect leading to reduced sympathetic outflow to the periphery and 3) suppression of renin activity. The results from long-term studies have not shown any diminution of the antihypertensive efficacy of atenolol with prolonged use.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</h2>
<p class="First">In man, absorption of an oral dose is rapid and consistent but incomplete. Approximately 50% of an oral dose is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, the remainder being excreted unchanged in the feces. Peak blood levels are reached between 2 and 4 hours after ingestion. Unlike propranolol or metoprolol, but like nadolol, hydrophilic atenolol undergoes little or no metabolism by the liver, and the absorbed portion is eliminated primarily by renal excretion. Atenolol also differs from propranolol in that only a small amount (6-16%) is bound to proteins in the plasma. This kinetic profile results in relatively consistent plasma drug levels with about a fourfold interpatient variation. There is no information as to the pharmacokinetic effect of atenolol on chlorthalidone.</p>
<p>The elimination half-life of atenolol is approximately 6 to 7 hours and there is no alteration of the kinetic profile of the drug by chronic administration. Following doses of 50 mg or 100 mg, both beta-blocking and antihypertensive effects persist for at least 24 hours. When renal function is impaired, elimination of atenolol is closely related to the glomerular filtration rate; but significant accumulation does not occur until the creatinine clearance <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falls</span> below 35 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span> (see prescribing information for atenolol).</p>

<h2>Atenolol Geriatric Pharmacology</h2>
<p class="First">In general, elderly patients present higher atenolol plasma levels with total clearance values about 50% lower than younger subjects. The half-life is markedly longer in the elderly compared to younger subjects. The reduction of atenolol clearance follows the general trend that elimination of renally excreted drugs is decreased with increasing age.</p>

<h2>Chlorthalidone</h2>
<p class="First">Chlorthalidone is a monosulfonamyl diuretic which differs chemically from thiazide diuretics in that a double ring system is incorporated in its structure. It is an oral diuretic with prolonged action and low toxicity. The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuretic effect</span> of the drug occurs within 2 hours of an oral dose. It produces <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span> with greatly increased excretion of sodium and chloride. At maximal therapeutic dosage, chlorthalidone is approximately equal in its <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuretic effect</span> to comparable maximal therapeutic doses of benzothiadiazine diuretics. The site of action appears to be the cortical diluting segment of the ascending limb of Henle’s loop of the nephron.</p>

<h2>Anesthesia and Major Surgery</h2>
<p class="First">It is not advisable to withdraw beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drugs prior to surgery in the majority of patients. However, care should be taken when using anesthetic agents such as those which may depress the myocardium. Vagal dominance, if it occurs, may be corrected with atropine (1-2 mg IV).</p>
<p>Beta blockers are competitive inhibitors of beta-receptor agonists and their effects on the heart can be reversed by administration of such agents; e.g., dobutamine or isoproterenol with caution (see section on<span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_d8225192-f83b-4f87-b298-800da47658be">OVERDOSAGE</a></span>).</p>

<h2>Pregnancy and Fetal Injury</h2>
<p class="First">Atenolol can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Atenolol crosses the placental barrier and appears in cord blood. Administration of atenolol, starting in the second trimester of pregnancy, has been associated with the birth of infants that are <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="72726" conceptname="Light-for-dates with signs of fetal malnutrition">small for gestational age</span>. No studies have been performed on the use of atenolol in the first trimester and the possibility of fetal injury cannot be excluded. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.</p>
<p>Neonates born to mothers who are receiving atenolol at parturition or breast-feeding may be at risk for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>. Caution should be exercised when atenolol and chlorthalidone is administered during pregnancy or to a woman who is breast-feeding. (See<span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_0b077442-3e2d-400d-98e5-19b86e1d6481">PRECAUTIONS, Nursing Mothers</a></span><span class="Bold">.</span>)</p>
<p>Atenolol and chlorthalidone was studied for teratogenic potential in the rat and rabbit. Doses of atenolol/chlorthalidone of 8/2, 80/20 and 240/60 mg/kg/day were administered orally to pregnant rats with no evidence of embryofetotoxicity observed. Two studies were conducted in rabbits. In the first study, pregnant rabbits were dosed with 8/2, 80/20 and 160/40 mg/kg/day of atenolol/chlorthalidone. No teratogenic effects were noted, but embryonic resorptions were observed at all dose levels (ranging from approximately 5 times to 100 times the maximum recommended human dose*). In the second rabbit study, doses of atenolol/chlorthalidone were 4/1, 8/2 and 20/5 mg/kg/day. No teratogenic or embryotoxic effects were demonstrated.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Atenolol </span>- Atenolol has been shown to produce a dose-related increase in embryo/fetal resorptions in rats at doses equal to or greater than 50 mg/kg/day or 25 or more times the maximum recommended human antihypertensive dose.* Although similar effects were not seen in rabbits, the compound was not evaluated in rabbits at doses above 25 mg/kg/day or 12.5 times the maximum recommended human antihypertensive dose.*</p>
<p>*Based on the maximum dose of 100 mg/day in a 50 kg patient.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Chlorthalidone </span>- Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. The use of chlorthalidone and related drugs in pregnant women requires that the anticipated benefits of the drug be weighed against possible hazards to the fetus. These hazards include fetal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="195064" conceptname="Perinatal jaundice due to hepatocellular damage">neonatal jaundice</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span> and possibly other adverse reactions which have occurred in the adult.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Atenolol and chlorthalidone may potentiate the action of other antihypertensive agents used concomitantly. Patients treated with atenolol and chlorthalidone plus a catecholamine depletor (e.g., reserpine) should be closely observed for evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> and/or marked <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span> which may produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439383" conceptname="Vertigo">vertigo</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">syncope</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span>.</p>
<p>Calcium channel blockers may also have an additive effect when given with atenolol and chlorthalidone. (See<span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_0df2629f-13c7-4b14-8664-475c32377c68">WARNINGS</a></span><span class="Bold">.</span>)</p>
<p>Thiazides may decrease arterial responsiveness to norepinephrine. This diminution is not sufficient to preclude the therapeutic effectiveness of norepinephrine. Thiazides may increase the responsiveness to tubocurarine.</p>
<p>Concomitant use of prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs, e.g., indomethacin, may decrease the hypotensive effects of beta blockers.</p>
<p>Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium toxicity</span>. Read prescribing information for lithium preparations before use of such preparations with atenolol and chlorthalidone.</p>
<p>Beta blockers may exacerbate the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221991" conceptname="Rebound hypertension">rebound hypertension</span> which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the beta blocker should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine. If replacing clonidine by beta-blocker therapy, the introduction of beta blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped.</p>
<p>While taking beta blockers, patients with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylactic reaction</span> to a variety of allergens may have a more severe reaction on repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic or therapeutic.

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Two long-term (maximum dosing duration of 18 or 24 months) rat studies and one long-term (maximum dosing duration of 18 months) mouse study, each employing dose levels as high as 300 mg/kg/day or 150 times the maximum recommended human antihypertensive dose*, did not indicate a carcinogenic potential of atenolol. A third (24 month) rat study, employing doses of 500 and 1,500 mg/kg/day (250 and 750 times the maximum recommended human antihypertensive dose*) resulted in increased incidences of benign adrenal medullary tumors in males and females, mammary fibroadenomas in females, and anterior <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437251" conceptname="Benign neoplasm of pituitary gland and craniopharyngeal duct">pituitary adenomas</span> and thyroid parafollicular cell carcinomas in males. No evidence of a mutagenic potential of atenolol was uncovered in the dominant lethal test (mouse), <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> cytogenetics test (Chinese hamster) or Ames test (<span class="Italics">S typhimurium</span>).</p>
<p>Fertility of male or female rats (evaluated at dose levels as high as 200 mg/kg/day or 100 times the maximum recommended human dose*) was unaffected by atenolol administration.</p>

<h2>Animal Toxicology</h2>
<p class="First">Six month oral administration studies were conducted in rats and dogs using atenolol and chlorthalidone doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day (atenolol/chlorthalidone 10/2.5 mg/kg/day–approximately 5 times the maximum recommended human antihypertensive dose*). There were no functional or morphological abnormalities resulting from dosing either compound alone or together other than minor changes in heart rate, blood pressure and urine chemistry which were attributed to the known pharmacologic properties of atenolol and/or chlorthalidone.</p>
<p>Chronic studies of atenolol performed in animals have revealed the occurrence of vacuolation of epithelial cells of Brunner’s glands in the duodenum of both male and female dogs at all tested dose levels (starting at 15 mg/kg/day or 7.5 times the maximum recommended human antihypertensive dose*) and increased incidence of atrial degeneration of hearts of male rats at 300 but not 150 mg atenolol/kg/day (150 and 75 times the maximum recommended human antihypertensive dose,* respectively).</p>
<p>*Based on the maximum dose of 100 mg/day in a 50 kg patient.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Atenolol is excreted in human breast milk at a ratio of 1.5 to 6.8 when compared to the concentration in plasma.

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of atenolol and chlorthalidone did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Atenolol and chlorthalidone tablets are usually well tolerated in properly selected patients. Most adverse effects have been mild and transient. The adverse effects observed for atenolol and chlorthalidone are essentially the same as those seen with the individual components.</p>

<h2>Atenolol</h2>
<p class="First">The frequency estimates in the following table were derived from controlled studies in which adverse reactions were either volunteered by the patient (US studies) or elicited, e.g., by checklist (foreign studies). The reported frequency of elicited adverse effects was higher for both atenolol and placebo-treated patients than when these reactions were volunteered. Where frequency of adverse effects for atenolol and placebo is similar, causal relationship to atenolol is uncertain.</p>

<h2>Clinical Laboratory Test Findings</h2>
<p class="First">Clinically important changes in standard laboratory parameters were rarely associated with the administration of atenolol and chlorthalidone. The changes in laboratory parameters were not progressive and usually were not associated with clinical manifestations. The most common changes were increases in uric acid and decreases in serum potassium.</p>

<p class="First">DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED (SEE<span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_7756016b-ec9b-43ac-9948-31cebfaa43d9">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</a></span>): Chlorthalidone is usually given at a dose of 25 mg daily; the usual initial dose of atenolol is 50 mg daily. Therefore, the initial dose should be one atenolol and chlorthalidone 50 mg-25 mg tablet given once a day. If an optimal response is not achieved, the dosage should be increased to one atenolol and chlorthalidone 100 mg-25 mg tablet given once a day.</p>
<p>When necessary, another antihypertensive agent may be added gradually beginning with 50% of the usual recommended starting dose to avoid an excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314171" conceptname="Low blood pressure reading">fall in blood pressure</span>.</p>
<p>Since atenolol is excreted via the kidneys, dosage should be adjusted in cases of severe impairment of renal function. No significant accumulation of atenolol occurs until creatinine clearance <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falls</span> below 35 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span> (normal range is 100-150 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>); therefore, the following maximum dosages are recommended for patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>.</p>
