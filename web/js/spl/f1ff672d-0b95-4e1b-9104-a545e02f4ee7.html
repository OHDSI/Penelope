<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">In a single and multiple dose absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) study, using H labeled drug, temazepam was well absorbed and found to have minimal (8%) first pass metabolism. There were no active metabolites formed and the only significant metabolite present in blood was the O-conjugate. The unchanged drug was 96% bound to plasma proteins. The blood level decline of the parent drug was biphasic with the short half-life ranging from 0.4 to 0.6 hours and the terminal half-life from 3.5 to 18.4 hours (mean 8.8 hours), depending on the study population and method of determination. Metabolites were formed with a half-life of 10 hours and excreted with a half-life of approximately 2 hours. Thus, formation of the major metabolite is the rate limiting step in the biodisposition of temazepam. There is no accumulation of metabolites. A dose-proportional relationship has been established for the area under the plasma concentration/time curve over the 15 to 30 mg dose range. Temazepam
            was completely metabolized through conjugation prior to excretion; 80% to 90% of the
            dose appeared in the urine. The major metabolite was the O-conjugate of temazepam (90%);
            the O-conjugate of N-desmethyl temazepam was a minor metabolite (7%).
                            <span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span><br><span class="Sup">3</span><br></p>
<p>Following ingestion of a 30 mg temazepam capsule, measurable
            plasma concentrations were achieved 10 to 20 minutes after dosing with peak plasma
            levels ranging from 666 to 982 ng/mL (mean 865 ng/mL) occurring approximately 1.2 to 1.6
            hours (mean 1.5 hours) after dosing. In a 7 day study, in which subjects were
            given a 30 mg temazepam capsule 1 hour before retiring, steady-state (as measured by the
            attainment of maximal trough concentrations) was achieved by the third dose. Mean plasma
            levels of temazepam (for days 2 to 7) were 260Â±210 ng/mL at 9 hours and 75Â±80 ng/mL at
            24 hours after dosing. A slight trend toward declining 24 hour plasma levels was seen
            after day 4 in the study, however, the 24 hour plasma levels were quite
            variable. At a dose of 30 mg once-a-day for 8 weeks, no evidence of enzyme
            induction was found in man.
                            <span class="Bold">Bioavailability, Induction, and Plasma
            Levels</span><br><br><br></p>
<p>The type and duration of hypnotic effects and the profile of unwanted effects during administration of benzodiazepine hypnotics may be influenced by the biologic half-life of the administered drug and for some hypnotics, the half-life of any active metabolites formed. Benzodiazepine hypnotics have a spectrum of half-lives from short (&lt;4 hours) to long (&gt;20 hours). When half-lives are long, drug (and for some drugs their active metabolites) may accumulate during periods of nightly administration and be associated with impairments of cognitive and/or motor performance during waking hours; the possibility of interaction with other psychoactive drugs or alcohol will be enhanced. In contrast, if half-lives are shorter, drug (and, where appropriate, its active metabolites) will be cleared before the next dose is ingested, and carry-over effects related to excessive sedation or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span> should be minimal or absent. However, during nightly use for an extended period, pharmacodynamic tolerance or adaptation to some effects of benzodiazepine hypnotics may develop. If the drug has a short elimination half-life, it is possible that a relative deficiency of the drug, or, if appropriate, its active metabolites (i.e., in relationship to the receptor site) may occur at some point in the interval between each night's use. This sequence of events may account for 2 clinical findings reported to occur after several weeks of nightly use of rapidly eliminated benzodiazepine hypnotics, namely, increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4100068" conceptname="Wakefulness">wakefulness</span> during the last third of the night, and the appearance of increased signs of daytime
 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>.

<p>Temazepam improved sleep parameters in clinical studies.
            Residual medication effects ("<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137607" conceptname="Hangover">hangover</span>") were essentially absent. Early morning
            awakening, a particular problem in the geriatric patient, was significantly
            reduced. Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">chronic insomnia</span> were evaluated in 2 week, placebo controlled sleep laboratory studies with temazepam at doses of 7.5 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg, given 30 minutes prior to bedtime. There was a linear dose-response improvement in total sleep time and sleep latency, with significant drug-placebo differences at 2 weeks occurring only for total sleep time at the 2 higher doses, and for sleep latency only at the highest dose. In these sleep laboratory studies, REM sleep was essentially unchanged and slow wave sleep was decreased. No measurable effects on daytime alertness or performance occurred following temazepam treatment or during the withdrawal period, even though a transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435524" conceptname="Sleep disorder">sleep disturbance</span> in some sleep parameters was observed following withdrawal of the higher doses. There was no evidence of tolerance development in the sleep laboratory parameters when patients were given temazepam nightly for at least 2 weeks. In addition, normal subjects with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">transient insomnia</span> associated with first night adaptation to the sleep laboratory were evaluated in 24 hour, placebo controlled sleep laboratory studies with temazepam at doses of 7.5 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg, given 30 minutes prior to bedtime. There was a linear dose-response improvement in total sleep time, sleep latency and number of awakenings, with significant drug-placebo differences occurring for sleep latency at all doses, for total sleep time at the 2 higher doses and for number of awakenings only at the 30 mg dose.

<h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Benzodiazepines may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. An increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of diazepam and chlordiazepoxide during the first trimester of pregnancy has been suggested in several studies. Transplacental distribution has resulted in neonatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span> following the ingestion of therapeutic doses of a benzodiazepine hypnotic during the last weeks of pregnancy. Reproduction studies in animals with temazepam were performed in rats and rabbits. In a perinatal-postnatal study in rats, oral doses of 60 mg/kg/day resulted in increasing nursling mortality. Teratology studies in rats demonstrated increased fetal resorptions at doses of 30 and 120 mg/kg in one study and increased occurrence of rudimentary ribs, which are considered skeletal variants, in a second study at doses of 240 mg/kg or higher. In rabbits, occasional abnormalities such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4309376" conceptname="Exencephaly">exencephaly</span> and fusion or asymmetry of ribs were reported without dose relationship. Although these abnormalities were not found in the concurrent control group, they have been reported to occur randomly in historical controls. At doses of 40 mg/kg or higher, there was an increased incidence of the 13th rib variant when compared to the incidence in concurrent and historical controls. Temazepam is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Patients should be instructed to discontinue the drug prior to becoming pregnant. The possibility that a woman of childbearing potential may be pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered.

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435524" conceptname="Sleep disorder">Sleep disturbance</span> may be the presenting manifestation of an underlying physical and/or psychiatric disorder. Consequently, a decision to initiate symptomatic treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> should only be made after the patient has been carefully evaluated. Worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> may be the consequence of an unrecognized psychiatric or physical disorder as may the emergence of new abnormalities of thinking or behavior. Such abnormalities have also been reported to occur in association with the use of drugs with central nervous system depressant activity, including those of the benzodiazepine class. Because some of the worrisome adverse effects of benzodiazepines, including temazepam, appear to be dose related ( ), it is important to use the lowest possible effective dose. Elderly patients are especially at risk. Some of these changes may be characterized by decreased inhibition, e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021344" conceptname="Abusive behavior">aggressiveness</span> and extroversion that seem out of character, similar to that seen with alcohol. Other kinds of behavioral changes can also occur, for example, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4092397" conceptname="Bizarre behavior">bizarre behavior</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4085688" conceptname="Loss of identity">depersonalization</span>. Complex behaviors such as "sleep-driving" (i.e., driving while not fully awake after ingestion of a sedative-hypnotic, with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439147" conceptname="Amnesia">amnesia</span> for the event) have been reported. These events can occur in sedative-hypnotic-naÃ¯ve as well as in sedative-hypnotic-experienced persons. Although behaviors such as sleep-driving may occur with temazepam alone at therapeutic doses, the use of alcohol and other CNS depressants with temazepam appears to increase the risk of such behaviors, as does the use of temazepam at doses exceeding the maximum recommended dose. Due to the risk to the patient and the community, discontinuation of temazepam should be strongly considered for patients who report a "sleep-driving" episode. Other complex behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have been reported in patients who are not fully awake after taking a sedative-hypnotic. As with sleep-driving, patients usually do not remember these events. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439147" conceptname="Amnesia">Amnesia</span> and other neuro-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4294810" conceptname="Psychiatric symptom">psychiatric symptoms</span> may occur unpredictably. In primarily depressed patients, worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, including suicidal thinking has been reported in association with the use of
              sedative/hypnotics. It can rarely be determined with certainty whether a particular instance of the abnormal behaviors listed above is drug induced, spontaneous in origin, or a result of an underlying psychiatric or physical disorder. Nonetheless, the emergence of any new behavioral sign or symptom of concern requires careful and immediate evaluation. Withdrawal symptoms (of the barbiturate type) have occurred after the abrupt discontinuation of benzodiazepines ( ).

Temazepam should be administered with caution in severely depressed patients or those in whom there is any evidence of latent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>; it should be recognized that suicidal tendencies may be present and protective measures may be necessary. The usual precautions should be observed in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function and in patients with chronic pulmonary insufficiency. If temazepam is to be combined with other drugs having known hypnotic properties or CNS-depressant effects, consideration should be given to potential additive effects. The possibility of a synergistic effect exists with the co-administration of temazepam and diphenhydramine. One case of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443213" conceptname="Stillbirth">stillbirth</span> at term has been reported 8 hours after a pregnant patient received temazepam and diphenhydramine.

<p class="First">Clinical studies of temazepam did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy commonly observed in this population. Temazepam 7.5 mg is recommended as the initial dosage for patient aged 65 and over since the risk of the development of oversedation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437584" conceptname="Ataxia">ataxia</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falls</span> increases substantially with larger doses of benzodiazepines in elderly and debilitated patients.

<h1>DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></h1>
<p class="First">Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> and tolerance. Abuse is characterized by misuse of the drug for non-medical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> is a state of adaptation that is manifested by a specific withdrawal syndrome that can be produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, decreasing blood level of the drug and/or administration of an antagonist. Tolerance is a state of adaptation in which exposure to a drug induces changes that result in a diminution of one or more of the drug's effects over time. Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs and may develop at different rates for different effects.</p>
<p>Addiction is a primary, chronic, neurobiological disease with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations. It is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following: impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug addiction</span> is a treatable disease, utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common.</p>

<p>Withdrawal symptoms, similar in character to those noted with barbiturates and alcohol (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span>, abdominal, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75635" conceptname="Cramp">muscle cramps</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span>), have occurred following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines. The more severe withdrawal symptoms have usually been limited to those patients who received excessive doses over an extended period of time. Generally milder withdrawal symptoms (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4148767" conceptname="Dysphoric mood">dysphoria</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>) have been reported following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines taken continuously at therapeutic levels for several months. Consequently, after extended therapy at doses higher than 15 mg, abrupt discontinuation should generally be avoided and a gradual dosage tapering schedule followed. As with any hypnotic, caution must be exercised in administering temazepam to individuals known to be addiction-prone or to those whose history suggests they may increase the dosage on their own initiative. It is desirable to limit repeated prescriptions without adequate medical supervision.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Manifestations of acute overdosage of temazepam can be expected to reflect the CNS effects of the drug and include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>, with reduced or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4290597" conceptname="Absent reflex">absent reflexes</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>. The oral LD of temazepam was 1963 mg/kg in mice, 1833 mg/kg in rats, and &gt;2400 mg/kg in rabbits.
                            <span class="Sub">50</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Treatment</span></p>
<p>If the patient is conscious, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> should be induced mechanically or with emetics. Gastric lavage should be employed utilizing concurrently a cuffed endotracheal tube if the patient is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372448" conceptname="Loss of consciousness">unconscious</span> to prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span> and pulmonary complications. Maintenance of adequate pulmonary ventilation is essential. The use of pressor agents intravenously may be necessary to combat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>. Fluids should be administered intravenously to encourage <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span>. The value of dialysis has not been determined. If excitation occurs, barbiturates should not be used. It should be borne in mind that multiple agents may have been ingested. Flumazenil (RomazicornÂ®)*, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, is indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines and may be used in situations when an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> with a benzodiazepine is known or suspected. Prior to the administration of flumazenil, necessary measures should be instituted to secure airway, ventilation, and intravenous access. Flumazenil is intended as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, proper management of benzodiazepine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. Patients treated with flumazenil should be monitored for re-sedation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, and other residual benzodiazepine effects for an appropriate period after treatment. The complete flumazenil
 package insert including CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS should be
 consulted prior to use.
