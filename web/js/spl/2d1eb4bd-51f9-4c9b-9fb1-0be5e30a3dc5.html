<h1>DESCRIPTION<span class="Italics"></span>
</h1>
<p class="First">Bexarotene is a member of a subclass of retinoids that selectively activate retinoid X receptors (RXRs). These retinoid receptors have biologic activity distinct from that of retinoic acid receptors (RARs). Each soft gelatin capsule for oral administration contains 75 mg of bexarotene.</p>
<p>The chemical name is 4-[1-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-3,5,5,8,8-pentamethyl-2-naphthalenyl) ethenyl] benzoic acid, and the structural formula is as follows:</p>

<p>Bexarotene is an off-white to white powder with a molecular weight of 348.48 and a molecular formula of C<span class="Sub">24</span>H<span class="Sub">28</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span>. It is insoluble in water and slightly soluble in vegetable oils and ethanol, USP.</p>
<p>Each Bexarotene capsule also contains the following inactive ingredients: polyethyelene glycol 400, NF, polysorbate 20, NF, povidone, USP and butylated hydroxyanisole, NF. The capsule shell contains gelatin NF, water, sorbitol sorbitan solution, NF, glycerin, USP and titanium dioxide, USP.   </p>

<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Bexarotene selectively binds and activates retinoid X receptor subtypes (RXRα, RXRβ, RXRγ). RXRs can form heterodimers with various receptor partners such as retinoic acid receptors (RARs), vitamin D receptor, thyroid receptor, and peroxisome proliferator activator receptors (PPARs). Once activated, these receptors function as transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes that control cellular differentiation and proliferation. Bexarotene inhibits the growth <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>of some tumor cell lines of hematopoietic and squamous cell origin. It also induces tumor regression <span class="Italics">in vivo </span>in some animal models. The exact mechanism of action of bexarotene in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> (CTCL) is unknown.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">After oral administration of Bexarotene capsules, bexarotene is absorbed with a T<span class="Sub">max</span> of about two hours. Terminal half-life of bexarotene is about seven hours. Studies in patients with advanced malignancies show approximate single dose linearity within the therapeutic range and low accumulation with multiple doses. Plasma bexarotene AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> values resulting from a 75 to 300 mg dose were 35% and 48% higher, respectively, after a fat-containing meal than after a glucose solution (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><a href="#ID_a5184ec9-e8bf-483e-920a-42eb14d8ca7f">PRECAUTIONS:Drug-Food Interaction</a></span></span><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"> </span></span>and <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID_c04a3766-c324-41e0-a9ba-1e56d5aec2e0">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>). </p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">Bexarotene is highly bound (&gt; 99%) to plasma proteins. The plasma proteins to which bexarotene binds have not been elucidated, and the ability of bexarotene to displace drugs bound to plasma proteins and the ability of drugs to displace bexarotene binding have not been studied (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><a href="#ID_faa480bc-a683-4b53-9a83-6b1e36573344">PRECAUTIONS: Protein Binding</a></span></span>). The uptake of bexarotene by organs or tissues has not been evaluated.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">Four bexarotene metabolites have been identified in plasma: 6- and 7-hydroxy-bexarotene and 6- and 7-oxo-bexarotene. <span class="Italics">In vitro </span>studies suggest that cytochrome P450 3A4 is the major cytochrome P450 responsible for formation of the oxidative metabolites and that the oxidative metabolites may be glucuronidated. The oxidative metabolites are active in <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>assays of retinoid receptor activation, but the relative contribution of the parent and any metabolites to the efficacy and safety of Bexarotene capsules is unknown.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Elimination</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">The renal elimination of bexarotene and its metabolites was examined in patients with Type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus. Neither bexarotene nor its metabolites were excreted in urine in appreciable amounts. Bexarotene is thought to be eliminated primarily through the hepatobiliary system.</p>

<h4>Body Weight and Gender</h4>
<p class="First">Based on the population pharmacokinetics analysis of data for 614 patients with a weight range of 26 to 145 kg, the bexarotene apparent clearance increases with increasing body weight. Gender has no statistically significant effect on bexarotene pharmacokinetics. </p>

<h4>Race</h4>
<p class="First">Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data for 540 Caucasian and 44 Black patients, bexarotene pharmacokinetics are similar in Blacks and Caucasians. There are insufficient data to evaluate potential differences in the pharmacokinetics of bexarotene for other races. </p>

<p class="First">No formal studies have been conducted with Bexarotene capsules in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>. Urinary elimination of bexarotene and its known metabolites is a minor excretory pathway (&lt; 1% of administered dose), but because <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> can result in significant protein binding changes, pharmacokinetics may be altered in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><a href="#ID_d50d7d3e-c0f8-4722-a29d-97e8864b7155">PRECAUTIONS: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span></a></span></span>). </p>

<h4>CYP3A4 Inhibitors/Inducers</h4>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro </span>studies suggested that bexarotene is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4); therefore ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, gemfibrozil, grapefruit juice, and other inhibitors of CYP3A4 would be expected to lead to an increase in plasma bexarotene concentrations. However, in a clinical study, concomitant administration of Bexarotene capsules with multiple doses of ketoconazole did not alter bexarotene plasma concentrations. This suggests that bexarotene elimination is not substantially dependent on CYP3A4 metabolism. The effects of concomitant administration of inducers of CYP3A4 such as rifampin, phenytoin, and phenobarbital have not been studied. </p>

<h4>Gemfibrozil</h4>
<p class="First">Concomitant administration of Bexarotene capsules and gemfibrozil resulted in substantial increases in plasma concentrations of bexarotene. Concomitant administration of gemfibrozil with Bexarotene capsules is not recommended (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><a href="#ID_95a0abf9-4702-4a22-9d8c-030306a12fb9">PRECAUTIONS: Drug-Drug Interactions</a></span></span>). </p>

<h4>Paclitaxel plus Carboplatin</h4>
<p class="First">The coadministration of paclitaxel (200 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> IV dose over 3 hours) plus carboplatin (at a dose expected to achieve an AUC of 6 mg•min/mL) with Bexarotene Capsules (400 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> orally once daily) increased the exposure to bexarotene (AUC<span class="Sub">0-24</span> and C<span class="Sub">max</span>) by 2-fold compared to Bexarotene Capsules alone (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><a href="#ID_95a0abf9-4702-4a22-9d8c-030306a12fb9">PRECAUTIONS: Drug-Drug Interactions</a></span></span>). </p>

<h4>Atorvastatin</h4>
<p class="First">Bexarotene concentrations were not affected by concomitant atorvastatin administration. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Effect of Bexarotene Capsules on Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs: </span></p>
<p>Bexarotene did not significantly inhibit the following enzymes in human liver microsomes: CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4. <span class="Italics">In vitro </span>data suggested a potential for bexarotene to inhibit CYP2C8 and induce CYP3A4. </p>

<h4>Atorvastatin</h4>
<p class="First">The exposure (AUC) to atorvastatin (a substrate for CYP3A4) decreased by half when atorvastatin was coadministered with Bexarotene Capsules (400 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> orally once daily). <br></p>

<h4>Tamoxifen</h4>
<p class="First">Based on interim data, concomitant administration of Bexarotene Capsules and tamoxifen resulted in approximately a 35% decrease in plasma concentrations of tamoxifen, possibly through induction of CYP3A4 by bexarotene. </p>
</div>

<p class="First">The exposure (AUC) to paclitaxel (a substrate for CYP3A4 and CYP2C8) decreased by 19% when paclitaxel (200 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> IV dose over 3 hours) was coadministered with Bexarotene Capsules (400 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> orally once daily). </p>
<p>The effect of Bexarotene Capsules on atorvastatin, tamoxifen and paclitaxel suggests that Bexarotene Capsules is an inducer for the CYP3A4 enzymes, and that it may reduce plasma concentrations of other substrates metabolized by CYP3A4, including oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><a href="#ID_e4ec7cf2-9eec-4688-ae46-b39de3423cd3">CONTRAINDICATIONS: Pregnancy: Category X</a></span></span><span class="Bold"> and </span><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><a href="#ID_95a0abf9-4702-4a22-9d8c-030306a12fb9">PRECAUTIONS: Drug-Drug Interactions</a></span></span>). </p>

<h2>Clinical Studies</h2>
<p class="First">Bexarotene capsules were evaluated in 152 patients with advanced and early stage cutaneous T-cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> (CTCL) in two multicenter, open-label, historically-controlled clinical studies conducted in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Australia. </p>
<p>The advanced disease patients had disease refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy (median of two, range one to six prior systemic therapies) and had been treated with a median of five (range 1 to 11) prior systemic, irradiation, and/or topical therapies. Early disease patients were intolerant to, had disease that was refractory to, or had reached a response plateau of six months on, at least two prior therapies. The patients entered had been treated with a median of 3.5 (range 2 to 12) therapies (systemic, irradiation, and/or topical).</p>
<p>The two clinical studies enrolled a total of 152 patients, 102 of whom had disease refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy, 90 with advanced disease and 12 with early disease. This is the patient population for whom Bexarotene capsules are indicated. </p>
<p>Patients were initially treated with a starting dose of 650 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day with a subsequent reduction of starting dose to 500 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day. Neither of these starting doses was tolerated, and the starting dose was then reduced to 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day. If, however, a patient on 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day of Bexarotene capsules showed no response after eight or more weeks of therapy, the dose could be increased to 400 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day.</p>
<p>Tumor response was assessed in both studies by observation of up to five baseline-defined index lesions using a Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Disease Severity (CA). This endpoint was based on a summation of the grades, for all index lesions, of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span>, scaling, plaque elevation, hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation, and area of involvement. Also considered in response assessment was the presence or absence of cutaneous tumors and extracutaneous disease manifestations. </p>
<p>All tumor responses required confirmation over at least two assessments separated by at least 4 weeks. A partial response was defined as an improvement of at least 50% in the index lesions without worsening, or development of new cutaneous tumors or noncutaneous manifestations. A complete clinical response required complete disappearance of all manifestations of disease, but did not require confirmation by biopsy.</p>
<p>At the initial dose of 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, 1/62 (1.6%) of patients had a complete clinical tumor response and 19/62 (30%) of patients had a partial tumor response. The rate of relapse (25% increase in CA or worsening of other aspects of disease) in the 20 patients who had a tumor response was 6/20 (30%) over a median duration of observation of 21 weeks, and the median duration of tumor response had not been reached. Responses were seen as early as 4 weeks and new responses continued to be seen at later visits. </p>

<h2>Pregnancy: Category X</h2>
<p class="First">Bexarotene capsules may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Bexarotene capsules must not be given to a pregnant woman or a woman who intends to become pregnant. If a woman becomes pregnant while taking Bexarotene capsules, Bexarotene capsules must be stopped immediately and the woman given appropriate counseling. </p>
<p>Bexarotene caused malformations when administered orally to pregnant rats during days 7-17 of gestation. Developmental abnormalities included incomplete ossification at 4 mg/kg/day and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135923" conceptname="Cleft palate">cleft palate</span>, depressed eye bulge/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="376512" conceptname="Microphthalmos">microphthalmia</span>, and small ears at 16 mg/kg/day. The plasma AUC of bexarotene in rats at 4 mg/kg/day is approximately one third the AUC in humans at the recommended daily dose. At doses greater than 10 mg/kg/day, bexarotene caused developmental mortality. The no effect dose for fetal effects in rats was 1 mg/kg/day (producing an AUC approximately one sixth of the AUC at the recommended human daily dose).</p>
<p>Women of child-bearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant when Bexarotene capsules are used. The possibility that a woman of child-bearing potential is pregnant at the time therapy is instituted should be considered. A <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4094448" conceptname="Pregnancy test negative">negative pregnancy test</span> (e.g., serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, beta-HCG) with a sensitivity of at least 50 mlU/L should be obtained within one week prior to Bexarotene capsules therapy, and the pregnancy test must be repeated at monthly intervals while the patient remains on Bexarotene capsules. Effective contraception must be used for one month prior to the initiation of therapy, during therapy and for at least one month following discontinuation of therapy; it is recommended that two reliable forms of contraception be used simultaneously unless abstinence is the chosen method. Bexarotene can potentially induce metabolic enzymes and thereby theoretically reduce the plasma concentrations of oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><a href="#ID_83c0dd6e-d826-4920-bb48-3dea58614d73">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug-Drug Interactions</a></span></span> and <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><a href="#ID_95a0abf9-4702-4a22-9d8c-030306a12fb9">PRECAUTIONS: Drug-Drug Interactions</a></span></span>). Thus, if treatment with Bexarotene capsules is intended in a woman with child-bearing potential, it is strongly recommended that one of the two reliable forms of contraception should be non-hormonal. Male patients with sexual partners who are pregnant, possibly pregnant, or who could become pregnant must use condoms during sexual intercourse while taking Bexarotene capsules and for at least one month after the last dose of drug. Bexarotene capsules therapy should be initiated on the second or third day of a normal menstrual period.

<h2><span class="Italics">Lipid abnormalities</span></h2>
<p class="First">Bexarotene capsules induce major lipid abnormalities in most patients. These must be monitored and treated during long-term therapy. About 70% of patients with CTCL who received an initial dose of ≥ 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day of Bexarotene capsules had fasting triglyceride levels greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal. About 55% had values over 800 mg/dL with a median of about 1200 mg/dL in those patients. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">Cholesterol</span> elevations above 300 mg/dL occurred in approximately 60% and 75% of patients with CTCL who received an initial dose of 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day or greater than 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, respectively. Decreases in high density lipoprotein (HDL) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> to less than 25 mg/dL were seen in about 55% and 90% of patients receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day or greater than 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, respectively, of Bexarotene capsules. The effects on triglycerides, HDL <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>, and total <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> were reversible with cessation of therapy, and could generally be mitigated by dose reduction or concomitant antilipemic therapy.</p>
<p>Fasting blood lipid determinations should be performed before Bexarotene capsules therapy is initiated and weekly until the lipid response to Bexarotene capsules is established, which usually occurs within 2 to 4 weeks, and at 8 week intervals thereafter. Fasting triglycerides should be normal or normalized with appropriate intervention prior to initiating Bexarotene capsules therapy. Attempts should be made to maintain triglyceride levels below 400 mg/dL to reduce the risk of clinical sequelae (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID_3d8382fd-0fb4-4a44-b7b9-987d2154f9f3">WARNINGS: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192640" conceptname="Pancreatitis">Pancreatitis</span></a></span>). If fasting triglycerides are elevated or become elevated during treatment, antilipemic therapy should be instituted, and if necessary, the dose of Bexarotene capsules reduced or suspended. In the 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day initial dose group, 60% of patients were given lipid lowering drugs. Atorvastatin was used in 48% (73/152) of patients with CTCL. Because of a potential drug-drug interaction (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><a href="#ID_95a0abf9-4702-4a22-9d8c-030306a12fb9">PRECAUTIONS:Drug-Drug Interactions</a></span></span>), gemfibrozil is not recommended for use with Bexarotene capsules.</p>

<p>Concomitant administration of Bexarotene capsules and tamoxifen resulted in approximately a 35% decrease in plasma concentrations of tamoxifen. </p>
<p>The exposure (AUC) to atorvastatin decreased by half when atorvastatin was coadministered with Bexarotene Capsules. This suggest that Bexarotene Capsules is an inducer for the CYP3A4 enzymes, and that it may reduce plasma concentrations of other substrates metabolized by CYP3A4, including oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><a href="#ID_83c0dd6e-d826-4920-bb48-3dea58614d73">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug-Drug Interactions</a></span></span><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"> </span></span>and <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><a href="#ID_e4ec7cf2-9eec-4688-ae46-b39de3423cd3">CONTRAINDICATIONS: Pregnancy: Category X</a></span></span>). Thus, if treatment with Bexarotene capsules is intended in a woman with child-bearing potential, it is strongly recommended that two reliable forms of contraception be used concurrently, one of which should be non-hormonal.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Long-term studies in animals to assess the carcinogenic potential of bexarotene have not been conducted. Bexarotene is not mutagenic to bacteria (Ames assay) or mammalian cells (mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> assay). Bexarotene was not clastogenic <span class="Italics">in vivo </span>(micronucleus test in mice). No formal fertility studies were conducted with bexarotene. Bexarotene caused testicular degeneration when oral doses of 1.5 mg/kg/day were given to dogs for 91 days (producing an AUC of approximately one fifth the AUC at the recommended human</p>
<p>daily dose).</p>

<h2>Use in Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">It is not known whether bexarotene is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from bexarotene, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Of the total patients with CTCL in clinical studies of Bexarotene capsules, 64% were 60 years or older, while 33% were 70 years or older. No overall differences in safety were observed between patients 70 years or older and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals to Bexarotene capsules cannot be ruled out. Responses to Bexarotene capsules were observed across all age group decades, without preference for any individual age group decade.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">The safety of Bexarotene capsules has been evaluated in clinical studies of 152 patients with CTCL who received Bexarotene capsules for up to 97 weeks and in 352 patients in other studies. The mean duration of therapy for the 152 patients with CTCL was 166 days. The most common adverse events reported with an incidence of at least 10% in patients with CTCL treated at an initial dose of 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day of Bexarotene capsules are shown in Table 1. The events at least possibly related to treatment are lipid abnormalities (elevated triglycerides, elevated total and LDL <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> and decreased HDL <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140673" conceptname="Hypothyroidism">hypothyroidism</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">asthenia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435224" conceptname="Leukopenia">leukopenia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4094513" conceptname="Ankle edema">peripheral edema</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal pain</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4039266" conceptname="Dry skin">dry skin</span>.

<p>The moderately severe (NCI Grade 3) and severe (NCI Grade 4) adverse events reported in two or more patients with CTCL treated at an initial dose of 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day of Bexarotene capsules (see Table 2) were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440360" conceptname="Pure hyperglyceridemia">hypertriglyceridemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4094513" conceptname="Ankle edema">peripheral edema</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435224" conceptname="Leukopenia">leukopenia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437827" conceptname="Pure hypercholesterolemia">hypercholesteremia</span>. Most of these moderately severe or severe adverse events occurred at a higher rate in patients treated at starting doses of greater than 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day than in patients treated at a starting dose of 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day.</p>
<p>As shown in Table 3, in patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 or 4 elevations in triglycerides and total <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> was 28% and 25%, respectively. In contrast, in patients with CTCL receiving greater than 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 or 4 elevated triglycerides and total <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> was 45% and 45%, respectively. Other Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities are shown in Table 3.</p>
<p>In addition to the 152 patients enrolled in the two CTCL studies, 352 patients received Bexarotene capsules as monotherapy for various advanced malignancies at doses from 5 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day to 1000 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day. The common adverse events (incidence greater than 10%) were similar to those seen in patients with CTCL.</p>
<p>In the 504 patients (CTCL and non-CTCL) who received Bexarotene capsules as monotherapy, drug-related serious adverse events that were fatal, in one patient each, were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="199074" conceptname="Acute pancreatitis">acute pancreatitis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4318408" conceptname="Subdural hematoma">subdural hematoma</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">liver failure</span>.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">What are Bexarotene</span> (beks-AIR-oh-teen) <span class="Bold">capsules?</span></p>
<p>Bexarotene (beks-AIR-oh-teen) capsules contain bexarotene (beks-AIR-oh-teen). Bexarotene (beks-AIR-oh-teen) capsules belong to a class of medicines known as retinoids. Each white to off-white, oblong soft gelatin Bexarotene capsule (beks-AIR-oh-teen) contains 75 mg of bexarotene (beks-AIR-oh-teen).

<p>• Because vitamin A in large doses may cause some side effects which are similar to those seen in patients taking Bexarotene (beks-AIR-oh-teen) capsules, do not take more than the recommended daily dietary allowance of vitamin A (4000 to 5000 International Units).

<p>• Always take Bexarotene (beks-AIR-oh-teen) capsules the way your doctor tells you.</p>
<p>• Your doctor will tell you how many Bexarotene (beks-AIR-oh-teen) capsules to take each day. You should take your daily dose of Bexarotene (beks-AIR-oh-teen) capsules all at once.

<p>• Always swallow each capsule whole; do not chew them or dissolve them in liquid or in your mouth. Depending on your health and condition, your doctor may change your daily dose (the number of capsules you are taking) during your treatment.</p>
<p>• If you miss a dose, take it as soon as possible, with food. However, if it is nearly time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your dose schedule as before. Do not take a double dose.</p>
<p>• If you take too many Bexarotene (beks-AIR-oh-teen) capsules or someone else accidentally takes your medicine, contact your doctor, emergency room or the nearest hospital immediately.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">How long before you can expect your CTCL to improve on Bexarotene </span>(beks-AIR-oh-teen)<span class="Bold"> capsule treatment?</span></p>
<p>• Although some patients saw improvement within the first several weeks of Bexarotene (beks-AIR-oh-teen) capsule treatment, most patients required several months or more of treatment to improve.</p>
<p>• Your doctor should determine how long you should be taking Bexarotene (beks-AIR-oh-teen) capsules, and when treatment may be stopped.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What side effects do Bexarotene </span>(beks-AIR-oh-teen)<span class="Bold"> capsules have?</span></p>
<p>The most common side effect is an increase in blood lipids (fats in the blood). Periodic blood tests will be needed to determine blood levels of lipids, including triglycerides and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>. Medication may be needed to control high fat levels in the blood.</p>
<p>Another common side effect is underactive thyroid. The symptoms of underactive thyroid may be difficult to detect because they may develop very gradually and may be very mild. For example, you may begin to feel always tired, low on energy, or feeling unusually <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">cold</span> all the time. A thyroid hormone medication is readily available to fully control these temporary symptoms, so contact your doctor early if you feel you are beginning to experience any of these symptoms. Periodic blood tests will be needed to detect this.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">When should you call your doctor about possible complications of Bexarotene </span>(beks-AIR-oh-teen)<span class="Bold"> capsule treatment?</span></p>
