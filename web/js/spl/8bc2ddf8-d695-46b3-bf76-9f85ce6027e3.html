<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Gallium nitrate injection is a clear, colorless, odorless, sterile solution of gallium nitrate, a hydrated nitrate salt of the group IIIa element, gallium. Gallium nitrate is formed by the reaction of elemental gallium with nitric acid, followed by crystallization of the drug from the solution. The stable, nonahydrate, Ga(N0<span class="Sub">3</span>)<span class="Sub">3</span>•9H<span class="Sub">2</span>O is a white, slightly hygroscopic, crystalline powder of molecular weight 417.87, that is readily soluble in water. Each mL of Ganite (gallium nitrate injection) contains gallium nitrate 25 mg (on an anhydrous basis) and sodium citrate dihydrate 28.75 mg. The solution may contain sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid for pH adjustment to 6.0-7.0.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Mechanism of Action</span></span> Ganite exerts a hypocalcemic effect by inhibiting calcium resorption from bone, possibly by reducing increased bone turnover. Although <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and animal studies have been performed to investigate the mechanism of action of gallium nitrate, the precise mechanism for inhibiting calcium resorption has not been determined. No cytotoxic effects were observed on bone cells in drug-treated animals.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Pharmacokinetics</span></span> Gallium nitrate was infused at a daily dose of 200 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> for 5 (n=2) or 7 (n=10) consecutive days to 12 cancer patients. In most patients apparent steady-state is achieved by 24 to 48 hours. The range of average steady-state plasma levels of gallium observed among 7 fully evaluable patients was between 1134 and 2399 ng/mL. The average plasma clearance of gallium (n=7) following daily infusion of gallium nitrate at a dose of 200 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> for 5 or 7 days was 0.15 L/hr/kg (range: 0.12 to 0.20 L/hr/kg). In one patient who received daily infusion doses of 100, 150 and 200 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> the apparent steady-state levels of gallium did not increase proportionally with an increase in dose. Gallium nitrate is not metabolized either by the liver or the kidney and appears to be significantly excreted via the kidney. Urinary excretion data for a dose of 200 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> has not been determined.</p>

Different types of malignancy seem to vary in their propensity to cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435511" conceptname="Hypercalcemia">hypercalcemia</span>. A higher incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435511" conceptname="Hypercalcemia">hypercalcemia</span> has been observed in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437233" conceptname="Multiple myeloma">multiple myeloma</span>, kidney cancer, and cancer of head and neck. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4166232" conceptname="Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy">Hypercalcemia of malignancy</span> seems to result from an imbalance between the net resorption of bone and urinary excretion of calcium.

Humoral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435511" conceptname="Hypercalcemia">hypercalcemia</span> is common with the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030314" conceptname="Neoplasm">solid tumors</span> of the lung, head and neck, kidney, and ovaries. Systemic factors (e.g., PTH-rP) produced either by the tumor or host cells have been implicated for the altered calcium fluxes between the extracellular fluid, the kidney, and the skeleton. About 30% of patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437233" conceptname="Multiple myeloma">myeloma</span> develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435511" conceptname="Hypercalcemia">hypercalcemia</span> associated with extensive osteolytic lesions and impaired glomerular filtration. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437233" conceptname="Multiple myeloma">Myeloma</span> cells have been reported to produce local factors that stimulate adjacent osteoclasts.</p>

In the absence of a direct measurement of free-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4125860" conceptname="Calcium electrolyte">ionized calcium</span>, measurement of the serum albumin concentration and correction of the total serum calcium concentration may help in assessing the severity of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435511" conceptname="Hypercalcemia">hypercalcemia</span>. The patient’s acid-base status should also be taken into consideration while assessing the degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435511" conceptname="Hypercalcemia">hypercalcemia</span>. Mild or asymptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435511" conceptname="Hypercalcemia">hypercalcemia</span> may be treated with conservative measures (i.e., saline hydration, with or without diuretics). The patient’s cardiovascular status should be taken into consideration in the use of saline. In patients who have an underlying cancer type that may be sensitive to corticosteroids (e.g., hematologic cancers), the use or addition of corticosteroid therapy may be indicated.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hypocalcemic Activity</span></span> A randomized double-blind clinical study comparing Ganite with calcitonin was conducted in patients with a serum calcium concentration (corrected for albumin) ≥ 12.0 mg/dL following 2 days of hydration. Ganite was given as a continuous intravenous infusion at a dose of 200 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day for 5 days and calcitonin was given intramuscularly at a dose of 8 I.U./kg every 6 hours for 5 days. Elevated serum calcium (corrected for albumin) was normalized in 75% (18 of 24) of the patients receiving Ganite and in 27% (7 of 26) of the patients receiving calcitonin (p=0.0016). The time-course of effect on serum calcium (corrected for albumin) is summarized in the following table.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First">(See boxed  <a href="#id_098d9af6-3cef-4c6a-8d0c-1f0473bd100b">WARNING</a>.) The hypercalcemic state in cancer patients is commonly associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>. Abnormalities in renal function (elevated BUN and/or serum creatinine) have been observed in clinical trials with Ganite. <span class="Bold">It is strongly recommended that serum creatinine be monitored during Ganite therapy.</span> Since patients with cancer-related <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435511" conceptname="Hypercalcemia">hypercalcemia</span> are frequently dehydrated, it is important that such patients be adequately hydrated with oral and/or intravenous fluids (preferably saline) and that a satisfactory urine output (a urine output of 2 L/day is recommended) be established before therapy with Ganite is started. Adequate hydration should be maintained throughout the treatment period, with careful attention to avoid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4266976" conceptname="Overhydration">overhydration</span> in patients with compromised cardiovascular status. Diuretic therapy should not be employed prior to correction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436375" conceptname="Hypovolemia">hypovolemia</span>. Ganite therapy should be discontinued if the serum creatinine level exceeds 2.5 mg/dL.</p>
<p>The use of Ganite in patients with marked <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> (serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL) has not been systematically examined. If therapy is undertaken in patients with moderately <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> (serum creatinine 2.0 to 2.5 mg/dL), frequent monitoring of the patient’s renal status is recommended.

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Rapid intravenous infusion of gallium nitrate or use of doses higher than recommended (200 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> and a substantially increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>. In the event of overdosage, further drug administration should be discontinued, serum calcium should be monitored, and the patient should receive vigorous intravenous hydration, with or without diuretics, for 2-3 days. During this time period, renal function and urinary output should be carefully monitored so that fluid intake and output are balanced.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">The usual recommended dose of Ganite is 200 mg per square meter of body surface area (200 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) daily for 5 consecutive days. In patients with mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435511" conceptname="Hypercalcemia">hypercalcemia</span> and few symptoms, a lower dosage of 100 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day for 5 days may be considered. If serum calcium levels are lowered into the normal range in less than 5 days, treatment may be discontinued early. The daily dose must be administered as an intravenous infusion over 24 hours. The daily dose should be diluted, preferably in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP, or 5% Dextrose Injection USP, for administration as an intravenous infusion over 24 hours. Adequate hydration must be maintained throughout the treatment period, with careful attention to avoid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4266976" conceptname="Overhydration">overhydration</span> in patients with compromised cardiovascular status. Controlled studies have not been undertaken to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of retreatment with gallium nitrate.</p>
<p>When Ganite is added to either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP or 5% Dextrose Injection USP, it is stable for 48 hours at room temperature (15°C to 30°C) or for 7 days if stored under refrigeration (2°C to 8°C). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.</p>
