<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">
              Refissa [Tretinoin Cream, USP (Emollient) 0.05%], contains the active ingredient tretinoin (a retinoid) in an emollient cream base. Tretinoin is a yellow-to-light-orange crystalline powder having a characteristic floral odor. Tretinoin is soluble in dimethylsulfoxide, slightly soluble in polyethylene glycol 400, octanol, and 100% ethanol. It is practically insoluble in water and mineral oil, and it is insoluble in glycerin. The chemical name for tretinoin is (all-E)-3,7-dimethyl-9-(2,6,6-trimethyl-1-cyclonexen-1-yl)-2,4,6,8-nonatetraenoic acid. Tretinoin is also referred to as all-<span class="Italics">trans</span>-retinoic acid and has a molecular weight of 300.44. The structural formula is represented below.
            </p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">The exact mechanism of action of tretinoin is unknown although retinoids are believed to exert an effect on the growth and differentiation of various epithelial cells. When applied topically, however, there was no noted increase in desmosine, hydroxyproline, or elastin mRNA in human skin. In addition, the role of the irritative nature of this product in effecting the positive effects attributed to this product for its indication has not yet been fully determined.</p>
<p>The transdermal absorption of tretinoin from various topical formulations ranged from 1% to 31% of applied dose, depending on whether it was applied to healthy skin or dermatitic skin. When percutaneous absorption of Tretinoin Cream, USP (Emollient) 0.05% was assessed in healthy male subjects (n=14) after a single application, as well as after repeated daily applications for 28 days, the absorption of tretinoin was less than 2% and endogenous concentrations of tretinoin and its major metabolites were unaltered.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL TRIALS DATA</h1>
<p class="First">Two adequate and well-controlled trials were conducted involving a total of 161 evaluable patients (under 50 years of age) treated with Tretinoin Cream, USP (Emollient) 0.05% and 154 evaluable patients treated with the vehicle emollient cream on the face for 24 weeks as an adjunct to a comprehensive skin care and sun avoidance program, to assess the effects on fine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkling</span>, mottled hyperpigmentation, and tactile skin roughness. Patients were evaluated at baseline on a 10-point scale, and changes from that baseline rating were categorized as follows:</p>
<p>
              No Improvement:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â No change or an increase of 1 unit or more<br>
              Minimal Improvement:Â Â Â Â Â Â Reduction of 1 unit<br>
              Moderate Improvement:Â Â Â Reduction of 2 units or more
            </p>
<p>In these trials, the fine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkles</span>, mottled hyperpigmentation, and tactile roughness of the facial skin were thought to be caused by multiple factors which included intrinsic aging or environmental factors, such as chronic sun exposure.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<ul>
<li>Refissa [Tretinoin Cream, USP (Emollient) 0.05%] is a dermal irritant, and the results of continued irritation of the skin for greater than 48 weeks in chronic long-term use are not known. There is evidence of atypical changes in melanocytes and keratinocytes, and of increased dermal elastosis in some patients treated with Tretinoin Cream, USP (Emollient) 0.05% for longer than 48 weeks. The significance of these findings is unknown.</li>
<li>Safety and effectiveness of Refissa in individuals with moderately or heavily pigmented skin have not been established.</li>
<li>Refissa should not be administered if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers (e.g., thiazides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides) because of the possibility of augmented <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4080920" conceptname="Phytophotodermatitis">phototoxicity</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="First">Because of heightened burning susceptibility, exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps) should be avoided or minimized during use of Refissa. Patients must be warned to use sunscreens (minimum SPF of 15) and protective clothing when using Refissa. Patients with sunburn should be advised not to use Refissa until fully recovered. Patients who may have considerable sun exposure, e.g., due to their occupation and those patients with inherent sensitivity to sunlight, should exercise particular caution when using Refissa and assure that the precautions outlined in the Patient Package Insert are observed.</p>
<p>Tretinoin should be kept out of the eyes, mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may cause severe local <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span>, burning, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">stinging</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4032013" conceptname="Desquamation">peeling</span> at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use less medication, decrease the frequency of application, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether.</p>
<p>Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used only with caution in patients with this condition.</p>
<p>Application of larger amounts of medication than recommended will not lead to more rapid or better results, and marked <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">redness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4032013" conceptname="Desquamation">peeling</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090431" conceptname="Discomfort">discomfort</span> may occur.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Concomitant topical medications, medicated or abrasive soaps, shampoos, cleansers, cosmetics with a strong drying effect, products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime, permanent wave solutions, electrolysis, hair depilatories or waxes, and products that may irritate the skin should be used with caution in patients being treated with Refissa [Tretinoin Cream, USP (Emollient) 0.05%] because they may increase irritation with Refissa.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">In a lifetime dermal study in CD-1 mice at 100 and 200 times the average recommended human topical clinical dose, a few <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135777" conceptname="Neoplasm of uncertain behavior of skin">skin tumors</span> in the female mice and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322895" conceptname="Nodule of liver">liver tumors</span> in male mice were observed. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span> of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when tretinoin was administered topically at a dose 5 times the average recommended human topical clinical dose. For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to the human exposure, the â€œrecommended human topical clinical doseâ€? is defined as 500 mg of Refissa applied daily to a 50 kg person.</p>
<p>In a chronic, two-year bioassay of Vitamin A acid in mice performed by Tsubura and Yamamoto, generalized amyloid deposition was reported in all groups in the basal layer of the Vitamin A treated skin. In CD-1 mice, a similar study reported hyalinization of the treated skin sites and the incidence of this finding was 0/50, 3/50, and 2/50 in male mice and 1/50, 0/50, 4/50 and 2/50 in female mice from the vehicle control, 0.25 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, and 1 mg/kg groups, respectively.</p>
<p>Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. In other studies, when lightly pigmented hairless mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to carcinogenic doses of UVB light, the incidence and rate of development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135777" conceptname="Neoplasm of uncertain behavior of skin">skin tumors</span> were either reduced or no effect was seen. Due to significantly different experimental conditions, no strict comparison of these disparate data is possible at this time. Although the significance of these studies in humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sun.</p>
<p>The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative.</p>
<p>Dermal Segment l and III studies with Tretinoin Cream, USP (Emollient) 0.05% have not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245750" conceptname="Growth retardation">growth retardation</span> were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (&gt;400 times the average human topical clinical dose).</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Underline">ORAL tretinoin</span> has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, rabbits, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in rats when given orally or topically in doses 1000 times the average recommended human topical clinical dose. However, variations in teratogenic doses among various <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which, metabolically, is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079975" conceptname="Congenital malformation">fetal malformations</span> were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (1000 times the average recommended human topical clinical dose), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques.

<p><span class="Underline">TOPICAL tretinoin</span> in animal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (200 times the recommended human topical clinical dose). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was dermally applied.
                    </p>
<p>There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered with doses of approximately 80 times the recommended human topical clinical dose of an increased incidence of domed head and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4043738" conceptname="Hydrocephalus">hydrocephaly</span>, typical of retinoid-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079975" conceptname="Congenital malformation">fetal malformations</span> in this species.</p>
<p>In contrast, several well-controlled animal studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin was not teratogenic, at doses of 100 and 200 times the recommended human topical clinical dose, in rats and rabbits, respectively.</p>
<p>With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty cases of temporally-associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of another formulation of topical tretinoin (Retin-A). Although no definite pattern of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> and no causal association has been established from these cases, 5 of the reports describe the rare birth defect category <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4149584" conceptname="Holoprosencephaly sequence">holoprosencephaly</span> (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain).

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">(See <a href="#warning">WARNINGS</a> and <a href="#precaution">PRECAUTIONS</a> sections.)</p>
<p>In double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies involving 179 patients who applied Tretinoin Cream, USP (Emollient) 0.05% to their faces, adverse reactions associated with the use of Tretinoin Cream, USP (Emollient) 0.05% were limited primarily to the skin. During these trials, 4% of patients had to discontinue use of Tretinoin Cream, USP (Emollient) 0.05% because of adverse reactions. These discontinuations were due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280604" conceptname="Skin irritation">skin irritation</span> or related cutaneous adverse reactions.</p>
<p>Local reactions such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4032013" conceptname="Desquamation">peeling</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4039266" conceptname="Dry skin">dry skin</span>, burning, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">stinging</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span> were reported by almost all subjects during therapy with Tretinoin Cream, USP (Emollient) 0.05%. These signs and symptoms were usually of mild to moderate severity and generally occurred early in therapy. In most patients the dryness, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4032013" conceptname="Desquamation">peeling</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">redness</span> recurred after an initial (24 week) decline.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<ul>
<li>Do NOT use Refissa [Tretinoin Cream, USP (Emollient) 0.05%] if the patient is pregnant or is attempting to become pregnant or is at high risk of pregnancy</li>
<li>Do NOT use Refissa if the patient is sunburned or if the patient has <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133835" conceptname="Eczema">eczema</span> or other chronic skin condition(s)</li>
<li>Do NOT use Refissa if the patient is inherently sensitive to sunlight</li>
<li>Do NOT use Refissa if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers (e.g., thiazides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides) because of the possibility of augmented <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4080920" conceptname="Phytophotodermatitis">phototoxicity</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="First">Patients require detailed instruction to obtain maximal benefits and to understand all the precautions necessary to use this product with greatest safety. The physician should review the Patient Package Insert.</p>
<p>Refissa should be applied to the face once a day before retiring, using only enough to cover the entire affected area lightly. Patients should gently wash their faces with a mild soap, pat the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4039266" conceptname="Dry skin">skin dry</span>, and wait 20 to 30 minutes before applying Refissa. The patient should apply a pea-sized amount of cream to cover the entire face lightly. Special caution should be taken when applying the cream to avoid the eyes, ears, nostrils, and mouth.</p>
<p>Application of Refissa [Tretinoin Cream, USP (Emollient) 0.05%] may cause a transitory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4141161" conceptname="Hot">feeling of warmth</span> or slight <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">stinging</span>.</p>
<p>Mitigation (palliation) of facial fine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkling</span>, mottled hyperpigmentation, and tactile roughness may occur gradually over the course of therapy. Up to six months of therapy may be required before the effects are seen. Most of the improvement noted with Refissa is seen during the first 24 weeks of therapy. Thereafter, therapy primarily maintains the improvement realized during the first 24 weeks.</p>
<p>With discontinuation of Refissa therapy, a majority of patients will lose most mitigating effects of Refissa on fine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkles</span>, mottled hyperpigmentation, and tactile roughness of facial skin; <span class="Bold">however, the safety and effectiveness of using Refissa daily for greater than 48 weeks have <span class="Underline">not</span> been established.</span></p>
<p>Application of larger amounts of medication than recommended may not lead to more rapid results or better results, and marked <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">redness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4032013" conceptname="Desquamation">peeling</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090431" conceptname="Discomfort">discomfort</span> may occur.</p>
<p>Patients treated with Refissa may use cosmetics, but the areas to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied. (See <a href="#precaution">PRECAUTIONS</a> section.)</p>

<h2>What is the Most Important Information about Refissa [Tretinoin Cream, USP (Emollient) 0.05%]</h2>
<p class="First">Refissa is a serious medication. It does not eliminate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkles</span> or repair sundamaged skin. It may help treat fine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkles</span>, spotty discoloration, and rough feeling skin, but it does not â€œcureâ€? these conditions. Refissa should only be used under supervision of your health care provider as part of a broad skin care program. This program should include avoiding direct sunlight (by using protective clothing and sunscreens with a minimum SPF of 15) and using other moisturizing facial creams that do not contain tretinoin.</p>
<p>You should use Refissa only at bedtime. Do not use drying skin care products. Use the smallest amount of Refissa needed and avoid getting it in your eyes, ears, nose or mouth.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">WARNING: Do not use Refissa if you are pregnant or attempting to become pregnant. Avoid sunlight and any other medicines that may increase your sensitivity to sunlight (see below).</span></p>
<p>Refissa has not been studied in people who are over 50 years of age or in people with moderately or darkly pigmented skin.</p>

<h2>What is Refissa?</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">(What can I expect from Refissa?)</span></p>
<p>Refissa is a serious medication that may help treat but will not â€œcureâ€? fine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkles</span>, spotty <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135030" conceptname="Discoloration of skin">skin discoloration</span>, and rough feeling skin.</p>
<p>Studies show that after 24 weeks, about 30% of the people who used Tretinoin Cream, USP (Emollient) 0.05% for fine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkles</span> or spotty discoloration had moderate improvement, another 35% had minimal improvement and 35% had no improvement. About 16% of the people who used Tretinoin Cream, USP (Emollient) 0.05% for rough skin had moderate improvement, 35% had minimal improvement, and 49% had no improvement. There is no evidence that Refissa treats coarse skin, deep <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkles</span>, yellowing skin, or other skin care problems.</p>
<p>Refissa should be used as part of a broad skin care program. This program should include avoiding direct sunlight (by using protective clothing and sunscreens with a minimum SPF of 15) and using other moisturizing facial creams that do not contain tretinoin. Many people can achieve desired effects by using this program without using Refissa. You should not use Refissa until you have tried a broad skin treatment program without Refissa.</p>
<p>When you use Refissa, improvement in fine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkling</span>, spotty <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135030" conceptname="Discoloration of skin">skin discoloration</span> and rough skin is not immediate and occurs gradually over time. Generally, you may notice some effects in 3 to 4 months. The effects are usually most noticeable at about 6 months with little additional improvement after that time. If Refissa is stopped, the improvement will gradually diminish.</p>
<p>The safety of using Refissa daily for more than 48 weeks has not been established.</p>

<h2>Who Should Not Use Refissa?</h2>
<p class="First">You should not use Refissa if you are sunburned or highly sensitive to the sun, if you have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133835" conceptname="Eczema">eczema</span>, or if your skin is irritated. Refissa can cause increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280604" conceptname="Skin irritation">skin irritation</span> and increased susceptibility to sunburn.</p>
<p>Since Refissa may make your skin more sensitive to sunlight, you should tell your health care professional if you are also using other medicines that increase sensitivity to sunlight because you should not be using Refissa with these medicines. These include but are not limited to: thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure), tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones or sulfonamides (used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>), and phenothiazines (used to treat serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4305081" conceptname="Emotional problems">emotional problems</span>). If you are taking any prescription medicines, non-prescription medicines or using any facial creams, check with a health care professional to make sure they do not interact with Refissa.</p>

There are reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span> with laboratory animals and humans that were given tretinoin by mouth. You should not use Refissa [Tretinoin Cream, USP (Emollient) 0.05%] if you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant.</p>

<h2>What should I avoid while using Refissa?</h2>
