<a href="#section-"></a>DESCRIPTION <p class="First">Darvon-N contains propoxyphene napsylate, USP which is an 
odorless, white crystalline powder with a bitter taste. It is very slightly 
soluble in water and soluble in methanol, ethanol, chloroform, and acetone. 
Chemically, it is (α<span class="Italics">S</span>,1<span class="Italics">R</span>)-α-[2-(Dimethylamino)-1-methylethyl]-α-phenylphenethyl 
propionate compound with 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid (1:1) monohydrate, which can 
be represented by the accompanying structural formula. Its molecular weight is 
565.72</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="STRUCTURE" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=c6c48eee-240b-4425-8691-35462523652e&amp;name=DARVON-NSTRUCTURE.jpg"></div>
<p>Propoxyphene napsylate differs from propoxyphene hydrochloride in that it 
allows more stable liquid dosage forms and tablet formulations. Because of 
differences in molecular weight, a dose of 100 mg (176.8 μmol) of propoxyphene 
napsylate is required to supply an amount of propoxyphene equivalent to that 
present in 65 mg (172.9 μmol) of propoxyphene hydrochloride. </p>
<p>Each tablet of Darvon-N contains 100 mg (176.8 μmol) propoxyphene napsylate. 
The tablet also contains cellulose, cornstarch, iron oxides, lactose, magnesium 
stearate, silicon dioxide, stearic acid, and titanium dioxide.</p>

<a href="http://"></a>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY <a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pharmacology <p class="First">Propoxyphene is a centrally acting opiate analgesic. In vitro 
studies demonstrated propoxyphene and the metabolite norpropoxyphene inhibit 
sodium channels (local anesthetic effect) with norpropoxyphene being 
approximately 2-fold more potent than propoxyphene and propoxyphene 
approximately 10-fold more potent than lidocaine. Propoxyphene and 
norpropoxyphene inhibit the voltage-gated potassium current carried by cardiac 
rapidly activating delayed rectifier (hERG) channels with approximately equal 
potency. It is unclear if the effects on ion channels occur within therapeutic 
dose range. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pharmacokinetics <a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Absorption <p>Peak plasma concentrations of propoxyphene are reached in 2 to 
2.5 h. After a 65-mg oral dose of propoxyphene hydrochloride, peak plasma levels 
of 0.05 to 0.1 μg/mL for propoxyphene and 0.1 to 0.2 μg/mL for norpropoxyphene 
(major metabolite) are achieved. Repeated doses of propoxyphene at 6 h intervals 
lead to increasing plasma concentrations, with a plateau after the ninth dose at 
48 h. Propoxyphene has a half-life of 6 to 12 h, whereas that of norpropoxyphene 
is 30 to 36 h. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Distribution <p>Propoxyphene is about 80% bound to proteins and has a large 
volume of distribution, 16 L/kg. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Metabolism <p>Propoxyphene undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism by 
intestinal and hepatic enzymes. The major route of metabolism is cytochrome 
CYP3A4 mediated N-demethylation to norpropoxyphene, which is excreted by the 
kidneys. Ring hydroxylation and glucuronide formation are minor metabolic 
pathways. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Excretion <p>In 48 h, approximately 20 to 25% of the administered dose of 
propoxyphene is excreted via the urine, most of which is free or conjugated 
norpropoxyphene. The renal clearance rate of propoxyphene is 2.6 L/min. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>SPECIAL POPULATIONS <a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Geriatric Patients <p>After oral administration of propoxyphene in elderly patients 
(70-78 years), much longer half-lives of propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene have 
been reported (propropoxyphene 13 to 35 h, norpropoxyphene 22 to 41 h). In 
addition, the AUC was an average of 3-fold higher and the Cmax was an average of 
2.5-fold higher in the elderly when compared to a younger (20-28 years) 
population. Longer dosage intervals may be considered in the elderly because the 
metabolism of propoxyphene may be reduced in this patient population. After 
multiple oral doses of propoxyphene in elderly patients (70-78 years), the Cmax 
of the metabolite (norpropoxyphene) was increased 5-fold. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pediatric Patients <p>Propoxyphene has not been studied in pediatric patients. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic Impairment</span> <p>No formal pharmacokinetic study of propoxyphene has been 
conducted in patients with mild, moderate or severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>. </p>
<p>After oral administration of propoxyphene in patients with cirrhosis, plasma 
concentrations of propoxyphene were considerably higher and norpropoxyphene 
concentrations were much lower than in control patients. This is presumably 
because of a decreased first-pass metabolism of orally administered propoxyphene 
in these patients. The AUC ratio of norpropoxyphene: propoxyphene was 
significantly lower in patients with cirrhosis (0.5 to 0.9) than in controls 
(2.5 to 4). </p>

conducted in patients with mild, moderate or severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>. </p>
<p>After oral administration of propoxyphene in anephric patients, the AUC and 
Cmax values were an average of 76% and 88% greater, respectively. Dialysis 
removes only insignificant amounts (8%) of administered dose of propoxyphene. 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Drug Interactions <p>The metabolism of propoxyphene may be altered by strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, 
clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, 
diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, grapefruit juice, and 
verapamil) leading to enhanced propoxyphene plasma levels. On the other hand, 
strong CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin may lead to enhanced metabolite 
(norpropoxyphene) levels. </p>
<p>Propoxyphene is also thought to possess CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme inhibiting 
properties. Coadministration with a drug that is a substrate of CYP3A4 or 
CYP2D6, may result in higher plasma concentrations and increased pharmacologic 
or adverse effects of that drug.</p>

<li>Patients should be advised to report <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> and adverse experiences occurring 
during therapy. Individualization of dosage is essential to make optimal use of 
this medication. 
</li>
<li>Patients should be advised not to adjust the dose of Darvon-N without 
consulting the prescribing professional. 
</li>
<li>Patients should be advised that Darvon-N may impair mental and/or physical 
ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks (e.g., 
driving, operating heavy machinery). 
</li>
<li>Patients should not combine Darvon-N with central nervous system depressants 
(e.g., sleep aids, tranquilizers) except by the orders of the prescribing 
physician, because additive effects may occur. 
</li>
<li>Patients should be instructed not to consume alcoholic beverages, including 
prescription and over-the-counter medications that contain alcohol, while using 
Darvon-N because of risk of serious adverse events including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. 
</li>
<li>Women of childbearing potential who become, or are planning to become, 
pregnant should be advised to consult their physician regarding the effects of 
analgesics and other drug use during pregnancy on themselves and their unborn 
child. 
</li>
<li>Patients should be advised that Darvon-N is a potential drug of abuse. They 
should protect it from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4087298" conceptname="Theft">theft</span>, and it should never be given to anyone other than 
the individual for whom it was prescribed. 
</li>
<li>Patients should be advised that if they have been receiving treatment with 
Darvon-N for more than a few weeks and cessation of therapy is indicated, it may 
be appropriate to taper the Darvon-N dose, rather than abruptly discontinue it, 
due to the risk of precipitating withdrawal symptoms. Their physician can 
provide a dose schedule to accomplish a gradual discontinuation of the 
medication. </li>

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Drug Interactions with Propoxyphene <p>Propoxyphene is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 
3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4), therefore potential interactions may occur when 
propoxyphene is administered concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 
activity. </p>
<p>The metabolism of propoxyphene may be altered by strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
(such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, 
nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, 
erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, grapefruit juice, and verapamil) 
leading to enhanced propoxyphene plasma levels. Coadministration with agents 
that induce CYP3A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of propoxyphene. Strong 
CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin may lead to enhanced metabolite 
(norpropoxyphene) levels. </p>
<p>Propoxyphene is also thought to possess CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme inhibiting 
properties and coadministration with drugs that rely on either of these enzymes 
for metabolism may result in increased pharmacologic or adverse effects of that 
drug. Severe neurologic signs, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>, have occurred with concurrent use 
of carbamazepine (metabolized by CYP3A4). </p>

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility 
<p>The mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of propoxyphene has not 
been evaluated. </p>
<p>In animal studies there was no effect of propoxyphene on mating behavior, 
fertility, duration of gestation, or parturition when rats were fed propoxyphene 
as a component of their daily diet at estimated daily propoxyphene intake up to 
8-fold greater than the maximum human equivalent dose (HED) based on body 
surface area comparison. At this highest dose, fetal weight and survival on 
postnatal day 4 was reduced. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pregnancy <a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Risk summary <a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pregnancy category C. <p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of propoxyphene 
in pregnant women. While there are limited data in the published literature, 
adequate animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with propoxyphene. 
Therefore, it is not known whether propoxyphene can affect reproduction or cause 
fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Propoxyphene should be given 
to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Clinical considerations <p>Propoxyphene and its major metabolite, norpropoxyphene, cross the 
human placenta. Neonates whose mothers have taken opiates chronically may 
exhibit <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> or withdrawal symptoms. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Data <p>In published animal reproduction studies, no teratogenic effects 
occurred in offspring born to pregnant rats or rabbits that received 
propoxyphene during organogenesis. Pregnant animals received propoxyphene doses 
approximately 10-fold (rats) and 4-fold (rabbits) the maximum recommended human 
dose (based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area comparison). 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Nursing Mothers <p>Propoxyphene, norpropoxyphene (major metabolite), are excreted in 
human milk. Published studies of nursing mothers using propoxyphene detected no 
adverse effects in nursing infants. Based on a study of six mother-infant pairs, 
an exclusively breastfed infant receives approximately 2% of the maternal 
weight-adjusted dose. Norpropoxyphene is renally excreted and renal clearance is 
lower in neonates than in adults. Therefore, it is possible that prolonged 
maternal propoxyphene use could result in norpropoxyphene accumulation in a 
breastfed infant. Watch breastfeeding infants for signs of sedation including 
poor feeding, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>.

when Darvon-N is administered to a nursing woman. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pediatric Patients <p>Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been 
established. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Elderly Patients <p>Clinical studies of Darvon-N did not include sufficient numbers 
of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from 
younger subjects. However, postmarketing reports suggest that patients over the 
age of 65 may be more susceptible to CNS-related side effects. Therefore, dose 
selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low 
end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, 
renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 
Decreased total daily dosage should be considered (see Dosage and Administration).</p>
