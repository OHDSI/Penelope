<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">PAXIL CR (paroxetine hydrochloride) is an orally administered psychotropic drug with a chemical structure unrelated to other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or to tricyclic, tetracyclic, or other available antidepressant or antipanic agents. It is the hydrochloride salt of a phenylpiperidine compound identified chemically as (-)-<span class="Italics">trans</span>-4<span class="Italics">R-</span>(4'-fluorophenyl)-3<span class="Italics">S</span>-[(3',4'-methylenedioxyphenoxy) methyl] piperidine hydrochloride hemihydrate and has the empirical formula of C<span class="Sub">19</span>H<span class="Sub">20</span>FNO<span class="Sub">3</span>•HCl•1/2H<span class="Sub">2</span>O. The molecular weight is 374.8 (329.4 as free base). The structural formula of paroxetine hydrochloride is:</p>

<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">The efficacy of paroxetine in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242733" conceptname="Premenstrual dysphoric disorder">premenstrual dysphoric disorder</span> (PMDD) is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system resulting from inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-hydroxy-tryptamine, 5-HT). Studies at clinically relevant doses in humans have demonstrated that paroxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. In vitro studies in animals also suggest that paroxetine is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake. In vitro radioligand binding studies indicate that paroxetine has little affinity for muscarinic, alpha<span class="Sub">1</span>-, alpha<span class="Sub">2</span>-, beta-adrenergic-, dopamine (D<span class="Sub">2</span>)-, 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span>-, 5-HT<span class="Sub">2</span>-, and histamine (H<span class="Sub">1</span>)-receptors; antagonism of muscarinic, histaminergic, and alpha<span class="Sub">1</span>-adrenergic receptors has been associated with various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular effects for other psychotropic drugs.</p>
<p>Because the relative potencies of paroxetine’s major metabolites are at most 1/50 of the parent compound, they are essentially inactive.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Paroxetine hydrochloride is completely absorbed after oral dosing of a solution of the hydrochloride salt. The elimination half-life is approximately 15 to 20 hours after a single dose of PAXIL CR. Paroxetine is extensively metabolized and the metabolites are considered to be inactive. Nonlinearity in pharmacokinetics is observed with increasing doses. Paroxetine metabolism is mediated in part by CYP2D6, and the metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine and to some extent in the feces. Pharmacokinetic behavior of paroxetine has not been evaluated in subjects who are deficient in CYP2D6 (poor metabolizers).</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Absorption and Distribution</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">Tablets of PAXIL CR contain a degradable polymeric matrix (GEOMATRIX™) designed to control the dissolution rate of paroxetine over a period of approximately 4 to 5 hours. In addition to controlling the rate of drug release in vivo, an enteric coat delays the start of drug release until tablets of PAXIL CR have left the stomach.</p>
<p>Paroxetine hydrochloride is completely absorbed after oral dosing of a solution of the hydrochloride salt. In a study in which normal male and female subjects (n = 23) received single oral doses of PAXIL CR at 4 dosage strengths (12.5 mg, 25 mg, 37.5 mg, and 50 mg), paroxetine C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0-inf</span> increased disproportionately with dose (as seen also with immediate-release formulations). Mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0-inf</span> values at these doses were 2.0, 5.5, 9.0, and 12.5 ng/mL, and 121, 261, 338, and 540 ng•hr./mL, respectively. T<span class="Sub">max</span> was observed typically between 6 and 10 hours post-dose, reflecting a reduction in absorption rate compared with immediate-release formulations. The bioavailability of 25 mg PAXIL CR is not affected by food.</p>
<p>Paroxetine distributes throughout the body, including the CNS, with only 1% remaining in the plasma.</p>
<p>Approximately 95% and 93% of paroxetine is bound to plasma protein at 100 ng/mL and 400 ng/mL, respectively. Under clinical conditions, paroxetine concentrations would normally be less than 400 ng/mL. Paroxetine does not alter the in vitro protein binding of phenytoin or warfarin.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Metabolism and Excretion</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">The mean elimination half-life of paroxetine was 15 to 20 hours throughout a range of single doses of PAXIL CR (12.5 mg, 25 mg, 37.5 mg, and 50 mg). During repeated administration of PAXIL CR (25 mg once daily), steady state was reached within 2 weeks (i.e., comparable to immediate-release formulations). In a repeat-dose study in which normal male and female subjects (n = 23) received PAXIL CR (25 mg daily), mean steady state C<span class="Sub">max</span>, C<span class="Sub">min</span>, and AUC<span class="Sub">0-24</span> values were 30 ng/mL, 20 ng/mL, and 550 ng•hr./mL, respectively.</p>
<p>Based on studies using immediate-release formulations, steady-state drug exposure based on AUC<span class="Sub">0-24</span> was several-fold greater than would have been predicted from single-dose data. The excess accumulation is a consequence of the fact that 1 of the enzymes that metabolizes paroxetine is readily saturable.</p>
<p>In steady-state dose proportionality studies involving elderly and nonelderly patients, at doses of the immediate-release formulation of 20 mg to 40 mg daily for the elderly and 20 mg to 50 mg daily for the nonelderly, some nonlinearity was observed in both populations, again reflecting a saturable metabolic pathway. In comparison to C<span class="Sub">min</span> values after 20 mg daily, values after 40 mg daily were only about 2 to 3 times greater than doubled. </p>
<p>Paroxetine is extensively metabolized after oral administration. The principal metabolites are polar and conjugated products of oxidation and methylation, which are readily cleared. Conjugates with glucuronic acid and sulfate predominate, and major metabolites have been isolated and identified. Data indicate that the metabolites have no more than 1/50 the potency of the parent compound at inhibiting serotonin uptake. The metabolism of paroxetine is accomplished in part by CYP2D6. Saturation of this enzyme at clinical doses appears to account for the nonlinearity of paroxetine kinetics with increasing dose and increasing duration of treatment. The role of this enzyme in paroxetine metabolism also suggests potential drug-drug interactions (see PRECAUTIONS).</p>
<p>Approximately 64% of a 30-mg oral solution dose of paroxetine was excreted in the urine with 2% as the parent compound and 62% as metabolites over a 10-day post-dosing period. About 36% was excreted in the feces (probably via the bile), mostly as metabolites and less than 1% as the parent compound over the 10-day post-dosing period.</p>

<h4><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Renal and Liver Disease</span></span></h4>
<p class="First">Increased plasma concentrations of paroxetine occur in subjects with renal and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>. The mean plasma concentrations in patients with creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min. were approximately 4 times greater than seen in normal volunteers.

<h4><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Elderly Patients</span></span></h4>
<p class="First">In a multiple-dose study in the elderly at daily doses of 20, 30, and 40 mg of the immediate-release formulation, C<span class="Sub">min</span> concentrations were about 70% to 80% greater than the respective C<span class="Sub">min</span> concentrations in nonelderly subjects.

<p class="First">The efficacy of PAXIL CR controlled-release tablets as a treatment for major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> has been established in two 12-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled studies of patients with DSM-IV Major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depressive Disorder</span>. One study included patients in the age range 18 to 65 years, and a second study included elderly patients, ranging in age from 60 to 88. In both studies, PAXIL CR was shown to be significantly more effective than placebo in treating major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> as measured by the following: Hamilton <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> Rating Scale (HDRS), the Hamilton <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="40546087" conceptname="Depressed mood">depressed mood</span> item, and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)–Severity of Illness score.</p>

Study 3 failed to consistently demonstrate a significant difference between PAXIL CR and placebo on any of these variables. </p>
<p>For all 3 studies, the mean dose of PAXIL CR for completers at endpoint was approximately 50 mg/day. Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age or gender.</p>
<p>Long-term maintenance effects of the immediate-release formulation of paroxetine in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> were demonstrated in an extension study.

<p class="First">The effectiveness of PAXIL CR for the treatment of PMDD utilizing a continuous dosing regimen has been established in 2 placebo-controlled trials. Patients in these trials met DSM-IV criteria for PMDD. In a pool of 1,030 patients, treated with daily doses of PAXIL CR 12.5 or 25 mg/day, or placebo the mean duration of the PMDD symptoms was approximately 11 ± 7 years.

Exposure to the feared situation almost invariably provokes <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, which may approach the intensity of a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021498" conceptname="Panic attack">panic attack</span>. The feared situations are avoided or endured with intense <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> or distress.

Lesser degrees of performance <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> or shyness generally do not require psychopharmacological treatment.</p>
<p>The efficacy of PAXIL CR as a treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span> has been established, in part, on the basis of extrapolation from the established effectiveness of the immediate-release formulation of paroxetine. In addition, the efficacy of PAXIL CR was established in a 12-week trial, in adult outpatients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span> (DSM-IV). PAXIL CR has not been studied in children or adolescents with social <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440985" conceptname="Phobia">phobia</span> (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY—Clinical Trials).</p>

<h2>Clinical Worsening and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> Risk</h2>
<p class="First">Patients with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and/or the emergence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4092095" conceptname="Planning suicide">suicidal ideation</span> and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> is a known risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18-24) with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.</p>
<p>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440374" conceptname="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">obsessive compulsive disorder</span> (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1,000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.</p>

<p>It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months.

Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.</p>
<p>Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient’s presenting symptoms.</p>
<p>If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION—Discontinuation of Treatment With PAXIL CR, for a description of the risks of discontinuation of PAXIL CR). </p>

While there are no human data showing such an interaction with paroxetine hydrochloride, limited animal data on the effects of combined use of paroxetine and MAOIs suggest that these drugs may act synergistically to elevate blood pressure and evoke behavioral excitation. Therefore, it is recommended that PAXIL CR not be used in combination with an MAOI (including linezolid, an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an MAOI (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). At least 2 weeks should be allowed after stopping PAXIL CR before starting an MAOI.</span></p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Teratogenic Effects</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">Epidemiological studies have shown that infants exposed to paroxetine in the first trimester of pregnancy have an increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly cardiovascular malformations. The findings from these studies are summarized below:</p>
<ul><li>A study based on Swedish national registry data demonstrated that infants exposed to paroxetine during pregnancy (n = 815) had an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations (2% risk in paroxetine-exposed infants) compared to the entire registry population (1% risk), for an odds ratio (OR) of 1.8 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.8). No increase in the risk of overall congenital malformations was seen in the paroxetine-exposed infants. The cardiac malformations in the paroxetine-exposed infants were primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434462" conceptname="Ventricular septal defect">ventricular septal defects</span> (VSDs) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4289309" conceptname="Atrial septal defect">atrial septal defects</span> (ASDs). Septal defects range in severity from those that resolve spontaneously to those which require surgery. </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>A separate retrospective cohort study from the United States (United Healthcare data) evaluated 5,956 infants of mothers dispensed antidepressants during the first trimester (n = 815 for paroxetine). This study showed a trend towards an increased risk for cardiovascular malformations for paroxetine (risk of 1.5%) compared to other antidepressants (risk of 1%), for an OR of 1.5 (95% confidence interval 0.8 to 2.9). Of the 12 paroxetine-exposed infants with cardiovascular malformations, 9 had VSDs. This study also suggested an increased risk of overall major congenital malformations including cardiovascular defects for paroxetine (4% risk) compared to other (2% risk) antidepressants (OR 1.8; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.8). <p class="First"></p>
</li>
<li>Two large case-control studies using separate databases, each with &gt;9,000 birth defect cases and &gt;4,000 controls, found that maternal use of paroxetine during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of right ventricular outflow tract obstructions. In one study the OR was 2.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 6.0, 7 exposed infants) and in the other study the OR was 3.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 8.8, 6 exposed infants). </li>
</ul>
<p>Other studies have found varying results as to whether there was an increased risk of overall, cardiovascular, or specific congenital malformations. A meta-analysis of epidemiological data over a 16-year period (1992 to 2008) on first trimester paroxetine use in pregnancy and congenital malformations included the above-noted studies in addition to others (n = 17 studies that included overall malformations and n = 14 studies that included cardiovascular malformations; n = 20 distinct studies). While subject to limitations, this meta-analysis suggested an increased occurrence of cardiovascular malformations (prevalence odds ratio [POR] 1.5; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.9) and overall malformations (POR 1.2; 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 1.4) with paroxetine use during the first trimester. It was not possible in this meta-analysis to determine the extent to which the observed prevalence of cardiovascular malformations might have contributed to that of overall malformations, nor was it possible to determine whether any specific types of cardiovascular malformations might have contributed to the observed prevalence of all cardiovascular malformations. </p>
<p> If a patient becomes pregnant while taking paroxetine, she should be advised of the potential harm to the fetus. Unless the benefits of paroxetine to the mother justify continuing treatment, consideration should be given to either discontinuing paroxetine therapy or switching to another antidepressant (see PRECAUTIONS—Discontinuation of Treatment With PAXIL CR<span class="Bold">)</span>. For women who intend to become pregnant or are in their first trimester of pregnancy, paroxetine should only be initiated after consideration of the other available treatment options.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Nonteratogenic Effects</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">Neonates exposed to PAXIL CR and other SSRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding.

<p>Infants exposed to SSRIs in late pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322024" conceptname="Pulmonary hypertension">pulmonary hypertension</span> of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 – 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. In a retrospective case-control study of 377 women whose infants were born with PPHN and 836 women whose infants were born healthy, the risk for developing PPHN was approximately six-fold higher for infants exposed to SSRIs after the 20<span class="Sup">th</span> week of gestation compared to infants who had not been exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. There is currently no corroborative evidence regarding the risk for PPHN following exposure to SSRIs in pregnancy; this is the first study that has investigated the potential risk. The study did not include enough cases with exposure to individual SSRIs to determine if all SSRIs posed similar levels of PPHN risk.</p>
<p>There have also been postmarketing reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439128" conceptname="Extreme immaturity">premature births</span> in pregnant women exposed to paroxetine or other SSRIs.</p>
<p>When treating a pregnant woman with paroxetine during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider both the potential risks and benefits of treatment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Physicians should note that in a prospective longitudinal study of 201 women with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4114950" conceptname="Endogenous depression">major depression</span> who were euthymic at the beginning of pregnancy, women who discontinued antidepressant medication during pregnancy were more likely to experience a relapse of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4114950" conceptname="Endogenous depression">major depression</span> than women who continued antidepressant medication.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Discontinuation of Treatment With PAXIL CR</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">Adverse events while discontinuing therapy with PAXIL CR were not systematically evaluated in most clinical trials; however, in recent placebo-controlled clinical trials utilizing daily doses of PAXIL CR up to 37.5 mg/day, spontaneously reported adverse events while discontinuing therapy with PAXIL CR were evaluated.

For patients receiving 25 mg/day or 12.5 mg/day, treatment was stopped without an incremental decrease in dose. With this regimen in those studies, the following adverse events were reported for PAXIL CR, at an incidence of 2% or greater for PAXIL CR and were at least twice that reported for placebo: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">Dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436817" conceptname="Feeling nervous">nervousness</span>, and additional symptoms described by the investigator as associated with tapering or discontinuing PAXIL CR (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4078201" conceptname="Mood swings">emotional lability</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4193492" conceptname="Acroparesthesia">electric shock sensations</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435524" conceptname="Sleep disorder">sleep disturbances</span>). These events were reported as serious in 0.3% of patients who discontinued therapy with PAXIL CR.</p>
<p>During marketing of PAXIL CR and other SSRIs and SNRIs, there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, (particularly when abrupt), including the following: Dysphoric mood, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4311114" conceptname="Sensory disorder">sensory disturbances</span> (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4193492" conceptname="Acroparesthesia">paresthesias</span> such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4193492" conceptname="Acroparesthesia">electric shock sensations</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377575" conceptname="Tinnitus">tinnitus</span>), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4061577" conceptname="Lethargy">lethargy</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4078201" conceptname="Mood swings">emotional lability</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333678" conceptname="Hypomania">hypomania</span>.

<p>As with other SSRIs, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4290615" conceptname="Dilated pupil">mydriasis</span> has been infrequently reported in premarketing studies with paroxetine hydrochloride. A few cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432312" conceptname="Chronic angle-closure glaucoma">acute angle closure glaucoma</span> associated with therapy with immediate-release paroxetine have been reported in the literature.

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Phenytoin</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">When a single oral 30-mg dose of immediate-release paroxetine was administered at phenytoin steady state (300 mg once daily for 14 days), paroxetine AUC and T<span class="Sub">½</span> were reduced (by an average of 50% and 35%, respectively) compared to immediate-release paroxetine administered alone. In a separate study, when a single oral 300-mg dose of phenytoin was administered at paroxetine steady state (30 mg once daily for 14 days), phenytoin AUC was slightly reduced (12% on average) compared to phenytoin administered alone. Since both drugs exhibit nonlinear pharmacokinetics, the above studies may not address the case where the 2 drugs are both being chronically dosed. No initial dosage adjustments are considered necessary when PAXIL CR is coadministered with phenytoin; any subsequent adjustments should be guided by clinical effect (see ADVERSE REACTIONS—Postmarketing Reports).</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">Many drugs, including most drugs effective in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (paroxetine, other SSRIs, and many tricyclics), are metabolized by the cytochrome P<span class="Sub">450</span> isozyme CYP2D6. Like other agents that are metabolized by CYP2D6, paroxetine may significantly inhibit the activity of this isozyme. In most patients (&gt;90%), this CYP2D6 isozyme is saturated early during paroxetine dosing. In 1 study, daily dosing of immediate-release paroxetine (20 mg once daily) under steady-state conditions increased single-dose desipramine (100 mg) C<span class="Sub">max</span>, AUC, and T<span class="Sub">½</span> by an average of approximately 2-, 5-, and 3-fold, respectively. Concomitant use of paroxetine with risperidone, a CYP2D6 substrate has also been evaluated. In 1 study, daily dosing of paroxetine 20 mg in patients stabilized on risperidone (4 to 8 mg/day) increased mean plasma concentrations of risperidone approximately 4-fold, decreased 9-hydroxyrisperidone concentrations approximately 10%, and increased concentrations of the active moiety (the sum of risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone) approximately 1.4-fold. The effect of paroxetine on the pharmacokinetics of atomoxetine has been evaluated when both drugs were at steady state. In healthy volunteers who were extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6, paroxetine 20 mg daily was given in combination with 20 mg atomoxetine every 12 hours. This resulted in increases in steady state atomoxetine AUC values that were 6- to 8-fold greater and in atomoxetine C<span class="Sub">max</span> values that were 3- to 4-fold greater than when atomoxetine was given alone. Dosage adjustment of atomoxetine may be necessary and it is recommended that atomoxetine be initiated at a reduced dose when given with paroxetine.</p>
<p>Concomitant use of PAXIL CR with other drugs metabolized by cytochrome CYP2D6 has not been formally studied but may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either PAXIL CR or the other drug.</p>
<p>Therefore, coadministration of PAXIL CR with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including certain drugs effective in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (e.g., nortriptyline, amitriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, and fluoxetine), phenothiazines, risperidone, tamoxifen, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.</p>
<p>However, due to the risk of serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4132309" conceptname="Sudden death">sudden death</span> potentially associated with elevated plasma levels of thioridazine, paroxetine and thioridazine should not be coadministered (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS).</p>
<p>Tamoxifen is a pro-drug requiring metabolic activation by CYP2D6. Inhibition of CYP2D6 by paroxetine may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of an active metabolite and hence reduced efficacy of tamoxifen.</p>
<p>At steady state, when the CYP2D6 pathway is essentially saturated, paroxetine clearance is governed by alternative P<span class="Sub">450</span> isozymes that, unlike CYP2D6, show no evidence of saturation (see PRECAUTIONS—Tricyclic Antidepressants).</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome CYP3A4</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">An in vivo interaction study involving the coadministration under steady-state conditions of paroxetine and terfenadine, a substrate for CYP3A4, revealed no effect of paroxetine on terfenadine pharmacokinetics. In addition, in vitro studies have shown ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity, to be at least 100 times more potent than paroxetine as an inhibitor of the metabolism of several substrates for this enzyme, including terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, triazolam, and cyclosporine. Based on the assumption that the relationship between paroxetine’s in vitro K<span class="Sub">i</span> and its lack of effect on terfenadine's in vivo clearance predicts its effect on other CYP3A4 substrates, paroxetine’s extent of inhibition of CYP3A4 activity is not likely to be of clinical significance.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">Caution is indicated in the coadministration of TCAs with PAXIL CR, because paroxetine may inhibit TCA metabolism.

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">Because paroxetine is highly bound to plasma protein, administration of PAXIL CR to a patient taking another drug that is highly protein bound may cause increased free concentrations of the other drug, potentially resulting in adverse events. Conversely, adverse effects could result from displacement of paroxetine by other highly bound drugs.</p>

<p class="First">The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of PAXIL CR either during continuous dosing or luteal phase dosing (incidence of 5% or greater and incidence for PAXIL CR at least twice that for placebo, derived from Table 6) were: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">Nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">asthenia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443262" conceptname="Lack or loss of sexual desire">libido decreased</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, female genital disorders, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">constipation</span>.</p>
<p>In the luteal phase dosing PMDD trial, which employed dosing of 12.5 mg/day or 25 mg/day of PAXIL CR limited to the 2 weeks prior to the onset of menses over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles, adverse events were evaluated during the first 14 days of each off-drug phase. When the 3 off-drug phases were combined, the following adverse events were reported at an incidence of 2% or greater for PAXIL CR and were at least twice the rate of that reported for placebo: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">Infection</span> (5.3% versus 2.5%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> (2.8% versus 0.8%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> (2.4% versus 0.8%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4283893" conceptname="Sinusitis">sinusitis</span> (2.4% versus 0%), and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">asthenia</span> (2.0% versus 0.8%).</p>

<h2>Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials</h2>
<p class="First">Table 2 enumerates adverse events that occurred at an incidence of 1% or more among patients treated with PAXIL CR, aged 18 to 65, who participated in 2 short-term (12-week) placebo-controlled trials in major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> in which patients were dosed in a range of 25 mg to 62.5 mg/day. Table 3 enumerates adverse events reported at an incidence of 5% or greater among elderly patients (ages 60 to 88) treated with PAXIL CR who participated in a short-term (12-week) placebo-controlled trial in major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> in which patients were dosed in a range of 12.5 mg to 50 mg/day. Table 4 enumerates adverse events reported at an incidence of 1% or greater among patients (19 to 72 years) treated with PAXIL CR who participated in short-term (10-week) placebo-controlled trials in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> in which patients were dosed in a range of 12.5 mg to 75 mg/day. Table 5 enumerates adverse events reported at an incidence of 1% or greater among adult patients treated with PAXIL CR who participated in a short-term (12-week), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span> in which patients were dosed in a range of 12.5 to 37.5 mg/day. Table 6 enumerates adverse events that occurred at an incidence of 1% or more among patients treated with PAXIL CR who participated in three, 12-week, placebo-controlled trials in PMDD in which patients were dosed at 12.5 mg/day or 25 mg/day and in one 12-week placebo-controlled trial in which patients were dosed for 2 weeks prior to the onset of menses (luteal phase dosing) at 12.5 mg/day or 25 mg/day. Reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based Dictionary terminology.</p>
<p>The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side effect incidence rate in the population studied.</p>

<p class="First">Although changes in sexual desire, sexual performance, and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder, they may also be a consequence of pharmacologic treatment. In particular, some evidence suggests that SSRIs can cause such untoward sexual experiences.</p>
<p>Reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance, and satisfaction are difficult to obtain; however, in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in product labeling, are likely to underestimate their actual incidence.</p>

<h2>Other Events Observed During the Clinical Development of Paroxetine</h2>
<p class="First">The following adverse events were reported during the clinical development of PAXIL CR and/or the clinical development of the immediate-release formulation of paroxetine.</p>
<p>Adverse events for which frequencies are provided below occurred in clinical trials with the controlled-release formulation of paroxetine. During its premarketing assessment in major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span>, and PMDD, multiple doses of PAXIL CR were administered to 1,627 patients in phase 3 double-blind, controlled, outpatient studies. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories.</p>
<p>In the tabulations that follow, reported adverse events were classified using a COSTART-based dictionary. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 1,627 patients exposed to PAXIL CR who experienced an event of the type cited on at least 1 occasion while receiving PAXIL CR. All reported events are included except those already listed in Tables 2 through 6 and those events where a drug cause was remote. If the COSTART term for an event was so general as to be uninformative, it was deleted or, when possible, replaced with a more informative term. It is important to emphasize that although the events reported occurred during treatment with paroxetine, they were not necessarily caused by it.</p>
<p>Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: Frequent adverse events are those occurring on 1 or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled trials appear in this listing); infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients.</p>
<p>Adverse events for which frequencies are not provided occurred during the premarketing assessment of immediate-release paroxetine in phase 2 and 3 studies of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440374" conceptname="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">obsessive compulsive disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434613" conceptname="Generalized anxiety disorder">generalized anxiety disorder</span>, and posttraumatic stress disorder. The conditions and duration of exposure to immediate-release paroxetine varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) open and double-blind studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, and fixed-dose and titration studies. Only those events not previously listed for controlled-release paroxetine are included. The extent to which these events may be associated with PAXIL CR is unknown.</p>
<p>Events are listed alphabetically within the respective body system. Events of major clinical importance are also described in the PRECAUTIONS section.</p>

<h2>Human Experience</h2>
<p class="First">Since the introduction of immediate-release paroxetine hydrochloride in the United States, 342 spontaneous cases of deliberate or accidental overdosage during paroxetine treatment have been reported worldwide (circa 1999). These include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> with paroxetine alone and in combination with other substances. Of these, 48 cases were fatal and of the fatalities, 17 appeared to involve paroxetine alone. Eight fatal cases that documented the amount of paroxetine ingested were generally confounded by the ingestion of other drugs or alcohol or the presence of significant comorbid conditions. Of 145 non-fatal cases with known outcome, most recovered without sequelae. The largest known ingestion involved 2,000 mg of paroxetine (33 times the maximum recommended daily dose) in a patient who recovered.</p>

<h2>Overdosage Management</h2>
<p class="First">Treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any drugs effective in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>.</p>
<p>Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. General supportive and symptomatic measures are also recommended. Induction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> is not recommended. Gastric lavage with a large-bore orogastric tube with appropriate airway protection, if needed, may be indicated if performed soon after ingestion, or in symptomatic patients.</p>
<p>Activated charcoal should be administered. Due to the large volume of distribution of this drug, forced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span>, dialysis, hemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. No specific antidotes for paroxetine are known.</p>
<p>A specific caution involves patients taking or recently having taken paroxetine who might ingest excessive quantities of a tricyclic antidepressant. In such a case, accumulation of the parent tricyclic and an active metabolite may increase the possibility of clinically significant sequelae and extend the time needed for close medical observation (see PRECAUTIONS—<span class="Italics">Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome CYP2D6).</span></p>
<p>In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple-drug involvement. The physician should consider contacting a poison control center for additional information on the treatment of any <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. Telephone numbers for certified poison control centers are listed in the <span class="Italics">Physicians' Desk Reference</span> (PDR).</p>

<p class="First">PAXIL CR should be administered as a single daily dose, usually in the morning, with or without food. The recommended initial dose is 25 mg/day. Patients were dosed in a range of 25 mg to 62.5 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of PAXIL CR in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>. As with all drugs effective in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, the full effect may be delayed. Some patients not responding to a 25-mg dose may benefit from dose increases, in 12.5-mg/day increments, up to a maximum of 62.5 mg/day. Dose changes should occur at intervals of at least 1 week.</p>
<p>Patients should be cautioned that PAXIL CR should not be chewed or crushed, and should be swallowed whole.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Maintenance Therapy</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">There is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with PAXIL CR should remain on it. It is generally agreed that acute episodes of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> require several months or longer of sustained pharmacologic therapy. Whether the dose of an antidepressant needed to induce remission is identical to the dose needed to maintain and/or sustain euthymia is unknown.</p>
<p>Systematic evaluation of the efficacy of immediate-release paroxetine hydrochloride has shown that efficacy is maintained for periods of up to 1 year with doses that averaged about 30 mg, which corresponds to a 37.5-mg dose of PAXIL CR, based on relative bioavailability considerations (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY—Pharmacokinetics).</p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Maintenance Therapy</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">Long-term maintenance of efficacy with the immediate-release formulation of paroxetine was demonstrated in a 3-month relapse prevention trial. In this trial, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> assigned to immediate-release paroxetine demonstrated a lower relapse rate compared to patients on placebo. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">Panic disorder</span> is a chronic condition, and it is reasonable to consider continuation for a responding patient.

<h2>Discontinuation of Treatment With PAXIL CR</h2>
<p class="First">Symptoms associated with discontinuation of immediate-release paroxetine hydrochloride or PAXIL CR have been reported (see PRECAUTIONS). Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment, regardless of the indication for which PAXIL CR is being prescribed. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate.</p>
