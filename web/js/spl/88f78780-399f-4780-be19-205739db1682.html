<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Milrinone Lactate Injection is a member of a new class of bipyridine inotropic/vasodilator agents with phosphodiesterase inhibitor activity, distinct from digitalis glycosides or catecholamines. Milrinone lactate is designated chemically as 1,6-dihydro-2-methyl-6-oxo-[3,4Â´-bipyridine]-5-carbonitrile lactate and has the following structure:</p>

<p>CH<span class="Sub">3</span>CHOHCOOH</p>
<p>Milrinone is an off-white to tan crystalline compound with a molecular weight of 211.22 and a molecular formula of C<span class="Sub">12</span>H<span class="Sub">9</span>N<span class="Sub">3</span>O. It is slightly soluble in methanol, and very slightly soluble in chloroform and in water. As the lactate salt, it is stable and colorless to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260836" conceptname="Blanching of skin">pale</span> yellow in solution. Milrinone LactateÂ is available as sterile aqueous solutions of the lactate salt of milrinone for injection or infusion intravenously.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Sterile, single dose vials:</span> Single dose vials of 10, 20 and 50 mL contain in each mL milrinone lactate equivalent to 1 mg milrinone and 47 mg Dextrose, Anhydrous, USP, in Water for Injection, USP. The pH is adjusted to between 3.2 and 4.0 with lactic acid or sodium hydroxide. The total concentration of lactic acid can vary between 0.95 mg/mL and 1.29 mg/mL. These vials require preparation of dilutions prior to administration to patients intravenously. </p>
<p><span class="Underline">Pre-Mix Flexible Containers</span>: The Flexible Containers provide two ready-to-use dilutions of milrinone in volumes of 100 mL and 200 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection. Each mL contains milrinone lactate equivalent to 200 mcg (0.2 mg) milrinone. The nominal concentration of lactic acid is 0.282 mg/mL. Each mL also contains 49.4 mg Dextrose Anhydrous, USP. The pH is adjusted to between 3.2 and 4.0 with lactic acid or sodium hydroxide. The flexible plastic container is comprised of polypropylene with a foil overwrap. Water can permeate the plastic into the overwrap, but the amount is insufficient to significantly affect the pre-mix solution.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Milrinone is a positive inotrope and vasodilator, with little chronotropic activity different in structure and mode of action from either the digitalis glycosides or catecholamines.</p>
<p>Milrinone, at relevant inotropic and vasorelaxant concentrations, is a selective inhibitor of peak III cAMP phosphodiesterase isozyme in cardiac and vascular muscle. This inhibitory action is consistent with cAMP mediated increases in intracellular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4125860" conceptname="Calcium electrolyte">ionized calcium</span> and contractile force in cardiac muscle, as well as with cAMP dependent contractile protein phosphorylation and relaxation in vascular muscle. Additional experimental evidence also indicates that milrinone is not a beta-adrenergic agonist nor does it inhibit sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase activity as do the digitalis glycosides.</p>
<p>Clinical studies in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span> have shown that milrinone produces dose-related and plasma drug concentration-related increases in the maximum rate of increase of left ventricular pressure. Studies in normal subjects have shown that milrinone produces increases in the slope of the left ventricular pressure-dimension relationship, indicating a direct inotropic effect of the drug. MilrinoneÂ also produces dose-related and plasma concentration-related increases in forearm blood flow in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>, indicating a direct arterial vasodilator activity of the drug.</p>
<p>Both the inotropic and vasodilatory effects have been observed over the therapeutic range of plasma milrinone concentrations of 100 ng/mL to 300 ng/mL.</p>
<p>In addition to increasing myocardial contractility, milrinone improves diastolic function as evidenced by improvements in left ventricular diastolic relaxation.</p>
<p>The acute administration of intravenous milrinone has also been evaluated in clinical trials in excess of 1600 patients with chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> associated with cardiac surgery, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>. The total number of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span>, either on therapy or shortly thereafter (24 hours) was 15, less than 0.9%, few of which were thought to be drug-related.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Following intravenous injections of 12.5 mcg/kg to 125 mcg/kg to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span> patients, milrinoneÂ had a volume of distribution of 0.38 liters/kg, a mean terminal elimination half-life of 2.3 hours, and a clearance of 0.13 liters/kg/hr. Following intravenous infusions of 0.2 mcg/kg/min to 0.7 mcg/kg/min to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span> patients, the drug had a volume of distribution of about 0.45 liters/kg, a mean terminal elimination half-life of 2.4 hours, and a clearance of 0.14 liters/kg/hr. These pharmacokinetic parameters were not dose-dependent, and the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve following injections was significantly dose-dependent.</p>
<p>MilrinoneÂ has been shown (by equilibrium dialysis) to be approximately 70% bound to human plasma protein.</p>
<p>The primary route of excretion of milrinoneÂ in man is via the urine. The major urinary excretions of orally administered milrinoneÂ in man are milrinone (83%) and its 0-glucuronide metabolite (12%). Elimination in normal subjects via the urine is rapid, with approximately 60% recovered within the first two hours following dosing and approximately 90% recovered within the first eight hours following dosing. The mean renal clearance of milrinone is approximately 0.3 liters/min, indicative of active secretion.</p>

<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> due to depressed myocardial function, milrinoneÂ produced a prompt dose and plasma concentration related increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span> and decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span>, which were accompanied by mild-to-moderate increases in heart rate. Additionally, there is no increased effect on myocardial oxygen consumption. In uncontrolled studies, hemodynamic improvement during intravenous therapy with milrinoneÂ was accompanied by clinical symptomatic improvement, but the ability of milrinoneÂ to relieve symptoms has not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials. The great majority of patients experience improvements in hemodynamic function within 5 to 15 minutes of initiation of therapy.</p>
<p>In studies in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span> patients, milrinoneÂ when administered as a loading injection followed by a maintenance infusion produced significant mean initial increases in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208254" conceptname="Cardiac index">cardiac index</span> of 25 percent, 38 percent, and 42 percent at dose regimens of 37.5 mcg/kg/0.375 mcg/kg/min, 50 mcg/kg/0.5 mcg/kg/min, and 75 mcg/kg/0.75 mcg/kg/min, respectively. Over the same range of loading injections and maintenance infusions, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure significantly decreased by 20 percent, 23 percent, and 36 percent, respectively, while systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span> significantly decreased by 17 percent, 21 percent, and 37 percent. Mean arterial pressure fell by up to 5 percent at the two lower dose regimens, but by 17 percent at the highest dose. Patients evaluated for 48 hours maintained improvements in hemodynamic function, with no evidence of diminished response (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052861" conceptname="Tachyphylaxis">tachyphylaxis</span>). A smaller number of patients have received infusions of milrinoneÂ for periods up to 72 hours without evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052861" conceptname="Tachyphylaxis">tachyphylaxis</span>.</p>
<p>The duration of therapy should depend upon patient responsiveness.</p>
<p>MilrinoneÂ has a favorable inotropic effect in fully digitalized patients without causing signs of glycoside toxicity. Theoretically, in cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314665" conceptname="Atrial flutter">atrial flutter</span>/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226399" conceptname="Fibrillation">fibrillation</span>, it is possible that milrinoneÂ may increase ventricular response rate because of its slight enhancement of AV node conduction. In these cases, digitalis should be considered prior to the institution of therapy with milrinone.</p>
<p>Improvement in left ventricular function in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4124683" conceptname="Silent myocardial ischemia">ischemic heart disease</span> has been observed. The improvement has occurred without inducing symptoms or electrocardiographic signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4124683" conceptname="Silent myocardial ischemia">myocardial ischemia</span>.</p>
<p>The steady-state plasma milrinoneÂ concentrations after approximately 6 to 12 hours of unchanging maintenance infusion of 0.5 mcg/kg/min are approximately 200 ng/mL. Near maximum favorable effects of milrinone on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span> and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure are seen at plasma milrinone concentrations in the 150 ng/mL to 250 ng/mL range.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Whether given orally or by continuous or intermittent intravenous infusion, milrinone has not been shown to be safe or effective in the longer (greater than 48 hours) treatment of patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>. In a multicenter trial of 1088 patients with Class III and IV <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, long-term oral treatment with milrinone was associated with no improvement in symptoms and an increased risk of hospitalization and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. In this study, patients with Class IV symptoms appeared to be at particular risk of life-threatening cardiovascular reactions. There is no evidence that milrinone given by long-term continuous or intermittent infusion does not carry a similar risk. </span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">The use of milrinone both intravenously and orally has been associated with increased frequency of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span>, including nonsustained <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">ventricular tachycardia</span>.

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">MilrinoneÂ should not be used in patients with severe obstructive aortic or pulmonic valvular disease in lieu of surgical relief of the obstruction. Like other inotropic agents, it may aggravate outflow tract obstruction in hypertrophic subaortic stenosis. </p>
<p>Supraventricular and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span> have been observed in the high-risk population treated. In some patients, injections of milrinone and oral milrinone have been shown to increase ventricular ectopy, including nonsustained <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">ventricular tachycardia</span>. The potential for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span>, present in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span> itself, may be increased by many drugs or combinations of drugs. Patients receiving milrinone should be closely monitored during infusion. </p>
<p>Milrinone produces a slight shortening of AV node conduction time, indicating a potential for an increased ventricular response rate in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314665" conceptname="Atrial flutter">atrial flutter</span>/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226399" conceptname="Fibrillation">fibrillation</span> which is not controlled with digitalis therapy. </p>
<p>During therapy with milrinone, blood pressure and heart rate should be monitored and the rate of infusion slowed or stopped in patients showing excessive decreases in blood pressure. </p>
<p>If prior vigorous diuretic therapy is suspected to have caused significant decreases in cardiac filling pressure, milrinone should be cautiously administered with monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and clinical symptomatology. </p>
<p>There is no experience in controlled trials with infusions of milrinone for periods exceeding 48 hours. Cases of infusion site reaction have been reported with intravenous milrinone therapy (see <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>). Consequently, <span class="Bold">careful monitoring of the infusion site should be maintained</span> to avoid possible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4295895" conceptname="Extravasation">extravasation</span>.</p>

<h3>Pregnancy Category C</h3>
<p class="First">Oral administration of milrinoneÂ to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis produced no evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> at dose levels up to 40 mg/kg/day and 12 mg/kg/day, respectively. Milrinone lactate did not appear to be teratogenic when administered intravenously to pregnant rats at doses up to 3 mg/kg/day (about 2.5 times the maximum recommended clinical intravenous dose) or pregnant rabbits at doses up to 12 mg/kg/day, although an increased resorption rate was apparent at both<br>8 mg/kg/day and 12 mg/kg/day (intravenous) in the latter species. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. MilrinoneÂ should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. </p>
