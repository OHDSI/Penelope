Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of neuroleptic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether neuroleptic drug products differ in their potential to cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> is unknown.<br>Both the risk of developing the syndrome and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of neuroleptic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.<br>There is no known treatment for established cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if neuroleptic treatment is withdrawn. Neuroleptic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying disease process.<br>The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.<br>Given these considerations, neuroleptics should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>. Chronic neuroleptic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that, 1) is known to respond to neuroleptic drugs, and 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.<br>If signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> appear in a patient on neuroleptics, drug discontinuation should be considered.

In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255848" conceptname="Pneumonia">pneumonia</span>, systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, etc.) and untreated or inad- equately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS).

There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.<br>If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered.

<p>The antiemetic action of prochlorperazine may mask the signs and symptoms of over- dosage of other drugs and may obscure the diagnosis and treatment of other conditions such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="193518" conceptname="Intestinal obstruction">intestinal obstruction</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4116092" conceptname="Intracranial tumor">brain tumor</span> and Reye’s Syndrome (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).<br>When prochlorperazine is used with cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> as a sign of the toxicity of these agents may be obscured by the antiemetic effect of prochlorperazine.<br>Because <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> may occur, large doses and parenteral administration should be used cautiously in patients with impaired cardiovascular systems.

If a vasoconstrictor is required, norepinephrine bitartrate and phenylephrine hydrochloride are suitable.

In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p>
