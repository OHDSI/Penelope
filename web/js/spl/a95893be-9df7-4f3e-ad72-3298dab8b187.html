<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Pancuronium bromide is a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent possessing all of the characteristic pharmacological actions of this class of drugs (curariform). It acts by competing for cholinergic receptors at the motor end-plate. The antagonism to acetylcholine is inhibited and neuromuscular block is reversed by anticholinesterase agents such as pyridostigmine, neostigmine, and edrophonium. Pancuronium bromide is approximately â…“ less potent than vecuronium and approximately 5 times as potent as d-tubocurarine; the duration of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">neuromuscular blockade</span> produced by pancuronium bromide is longer than that of vecuronium at initially equipotent doses.</p>
<p>The ED<span class="Sub">95</span> (dose required to produce 95% suppression of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4247265" conceptname="Muscle twitch">muscle twitch</span> response) is approximately 0.05 mg/kg under balanced anesthesia and 0.03 mg/kg under halothane anesthesia. These doses produce effective skeletal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">muscle relaxation</span> (as judged by time from maximum effect to 25% recovery of control twitch height) for approximately 22 minutes; the duration from injection to 90% recovery of control twitch height is approximately 65 minutes. The intubating dose of 0.1 mg/kg (balanced anesthesia) will effectively abolish twitch response within approximately 4 minutes; time from injection to 25% recovery from this dose is approximately 100 minutes.</p>
<p>Supplemental doses to maintain <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">muscle relaxation</span> slightly increase the magnitude of block and significantly increase the duration of block. The use of a peripheral nerve stimulator is of benefit in assessing the degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">neuromuscular blockade</span>.</p>
<p>The most characteristic circulatory effects of pancuronium, studied under halothane anesthesia, are a moderate rise in heart rate, mean arterial pressure and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span>; systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span> is not changed significantly and central venous pressure may <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> slightly. The heart rate rise is inversely related to the rate immediately before administration of pancuronium, is blocked by prior administration of atropine, and appears unrelated to the concentration of halothane or dose of pancuronium.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">The elimination half-life of pancuronium has been reported to range between 89â€“161 minutes. The volume of distribution ranges from 241â€“280 mL/kg and plasma clearance is approximately 1.1â€“1.9 mL/minute/kg. Approximately 40% of the total dose of pancuronium has been recovered in urine as unchanged pancuronium and its metabolites while approximately 11% has been recovered in bile. As much as 25% of an injected dose may be recovered as 3-hydroxy metabolite, which is half as potent a blocking agent as pancuronium. Less than 5% of the injected dose is recovered as 17-hydroxy metabolite and 3,17-dihydroxy metabolite, which have been judged to be approximately 50 times less potent than pancuronium. Pancuronium exhibits strong binding to gamma globulin and moderate binding to albumin. Approximately 13% is unbound to plasma protein. In patients with cirrhosis the volume of distribution is increased by approximately 50%, the plasma clearance is decreased by approximately 22% and the elimination half-life is doubled. Similar results were noted in patients with biliary obstruction, except that plasma clearance was less than half the normal rate. The initial total dose to achieve adequate relaxation may thus be high in patients with hepatic and/or biliary tract dysfunction, while the duration of action is greater than usual.</p>
<p>The elimination half-life is doubled and the plasma clearance is reduced by approximately 60% in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span>. The volume of distribution is variable, and in some cases elevated. The rate of recovery of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">neuromuscular blockade</span>, as determined by peripheral nerve stimulation is variable and sometimes very much slower than normal.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">Anaphylaxis</span></h2>
<p class="First">Severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylactic reactions</span> to neuromuscular blocking agents, including pancuronium bromide, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Precautions should also be taken in those individuals who have had previous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylactic reactions</span> to other neuromuscular blocking agents, since cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported.</p>
<p>In patients who are known to have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="76685" conceptname="Myasthenia gravis">myasthenia gravis</span> or the myasthenic (Eaton-Lambert) syndrome, small doses of pancuronium bromide may have profound effects. In such patients, a peripheral nerve stimulator and use of a small test dose may be of value in monitoring the response to administration of muscle relaxants.</p>
<p>Pancuronium bromide contains benzyl alcohol, which is potentially toxic when administered locally to neural tissue. Exposure to excessive amounts of benzyl alcohol has been associated with toxicity (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span>), particularly in neonates, and an increased incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4326231" conceptname="Kernicterus">kernicterus</span>, particularly in small preterm infants. There have been rare reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span>, primarily in preterm infants, associated with exposure to excessive amounts of benzyl alcohol. The amount of benzyl alcohol from medications is usually considered negligible compared to that received in flush solutions containing benzyl alcohol. Administration of high dosages of medications containing this preservative must take into account the total amount of benzyl alcohol administered. The amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. If the patient requires more than the recommended dosages or other medications containing this preservative, the practitioner must consider the daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from these combined sources (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_warnings_ID_warnings">WARNINGS</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><a href="#i4i_pediatric_use_ID_p_peds">PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use</a></span></span>).</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Although pancuronium bromide injection has been used successfully in many patients with pre-existing pulmonary, hepatic, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>, caution should be exercised in these situations.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">Anaphylaxis</span></h2>
<p class="First">Since allergic cross-reactivity has been reported in this class, request information from your patients about previous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylactic reactions</span> to other neuromuscular blocking agents. In addition, inform your patients that severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylactic reactions</span> to neuromuscular blocking agents, including pancuronium bromide, have been reported.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Failure</span></h2>
<p class="First">A major portion of pancuronium, as well as an active metabolite, are recovered in urine. The elimination half-life is doubled and the plasma clearance is reduced in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span>; at the same time, the rate of recovery of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">neuromuscular blockade</span> is variable and sometimes very much slower than normal. (See<span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_pharmacokinetics_ID_pharmacokinetics"> Pharmacokinetics</a></span>.) This information should be taken into consideration if pancuronium is selected, for other reasons, to be used in a patient with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span>.</p>

<h2>Altered Circulation Time</h2>
<p class="First">Conditions associated with slower circulation time in cardiovascular disease, old age, and edematous states resulting in increased volume of distribution may contribute to a delay in onset time; therefore, dosage should not be increased.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">

<h2>Hepatic and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197917" conceptname="Disorder of biliary tract">Biliary Tract Disease</span></h2>
<p class="First">The doubled elimination half-life and reduced plasma clearance determined in patients with hepatic and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197917" conceptname="Disorder of biliary tract">biliary tract disease</span>, as well as limited data showing that recovery time is prolonged an average of 65% in patients with biliary tract obstruction, suggests that prolongation of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">neuromuscular blockade</span> may occur. At the same time, these conditions are characterized by an approximately 50% increase in volume of distribution of pancuronium, suggesting that the total initial dose to achieve adequate relaxation may in some cases be high. The possibility of slower onset, higher total dosage and prolongation of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">neuromuscular blockade</span> must be taken into consideration when pancuronium is used in these patients.

<h2>Long-term Use in I.C.U.</h2>
<p class="First">In the intensive care unit, in rare cases, long-term use of neuromuscular blocking drugs to facilitate mechanical ventilation may be associated with prolonged <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440377" conceptname="Paralysis">paralysis</span> and/or skeletal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79908" conceptname="Muscle weakness">muscle weakness</span>, that may be first noted during attempts to wean such patients from the ventilator. Typically, such patients receive other drugs such as broad spectrum antibiotics, narcotics and/or steroids and may have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022093" conceptname="Electrolyte imbalance">electrolyte imbalance</span> and diseases which lead to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022093" conceptname="Electrolyte imbalance">electrolyte imbalance</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxic</span> episodes of varying duration, acid-base imbalance and extreme debilitation, any of which may enhance the actions of a neuromuscular blocking agent. Additionally, patients immobilized for extended periods frequently develop symptoms consistent with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="78236" conceptname="Muscle atrophy">disuse muscle atrophy</span>. Therefore, when there is a need for long-term mechanical ventilation, the benefits-to-risk ratio of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">neuromuscular blockade</span> must be considered.</p>
<p>Continuous infusion or intermittent bolus dosing to support mechanical ventilation, has not been studied sufficiently to support dosage recommendations.</p>
<p>UNDER THE ABOVE CONDITIONS, APPROPRIATE MONITORING, SUCH AS USE OF A PERIPHERAL NERVE STIMULATOR, TO ASSESS THE DEGREE OF <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKADE</span>, MAY PRECLUDE INADVERTENT EXCESS DOSING.</p>

<p class="First">Pancuronium bromide has no known effect on consciousness, the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> threshold or cerebration. Administration should be accompanied by adequate anesthesia or sedation.</p>
</div>

<a name="i4i_interactions_ID_di"></a><a name="section-7.9"></a><p></p>
<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Prior administration of succinylcholine may enhance the neuromuscular blocking effect of pancuronium bromide and increase its duration of action. If succinylcholine is used before pancuronium bromide the administration of pancuronium bromide should be delayed until the patient starts recovering from succinylcholine-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">neuromuscular blockade</span>.</p>
<p>If a small dose of pancuronium bromide is given at least 3 minutes prior to the administration of succinylcholine, in order to reduce the incidence and intensity of succinylcholine-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4189159" conceptname="Muscle fibrillation">fasciculations</span>, this dose may induce a degree of neuromuscular block sufficient to cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> in some patients.</p>
<p>Other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (vecuronium, atracurium, d-tubocurarine, metocurine, and gallamine) behave in a clinically similar fashion to pancuronium bromide. The combinations of pancuronium bromide-metocurine and pancuronium bromide-d-tubocurarine are significantly more potent than the additive effects of each of the individual drugs given alone; however, the duration of blockade of these combinations is not prolonged. There are insufficient data to support concomitant use of pancuronium and the other three above mentioned muscle relaxants in the same patients.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="i4i_section_id_6e54adb7-2efe-40e6-8626-1ae325453184"></a><a name="section-7.10"></a><p></p>
<h2>Inhalational Anesthetics</h2>
<p class="First">Use of volatile inhalational anesthetics such as enflurane, isoflurane, and halothane with pancuronium bromide will enhance <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">neuromuscular blockade</span>. Potentiation is most prominent with use of enflurane and isoflurane.</p>
<p>With the above agents, the intubating dose of pancuronium bromide may be the same as with balanced anesthesia unless the inhalational anesthetic has been administered for a sufficient time at a sufficient dose to have reached clinical equilibrium. The relatively long duration of action of pancuronium should be taken into consideration when the drug is selected for intubation in these circumstances.</p>
<p>Clinical experience and animal experiments suggest that pancuronium should be given with caution to patients receiving chronic tricyclic antidepressant therapy who are anesthetized with halothane because severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span> may result from this combination. The severity of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span> appears in part related to the dose of pancuronium.</p>

<h2>Antibiotics</h2>
<p class="First">Parenteral/intraperitoneal administration of high doses of certain antibiotics may intensify or produce neuromuscular block on their own. The following antibiotics have been associated with various degrees of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440377" conceptname="Paralysis">paralysis</span>: aminoglycosides (such as neomycin, streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, and dihydrostreptomycin); tetracyclines; bacitracin; polymyxin B; colistin; and sodium colistimethate. If these or other newly introduced antibiotics are used preoperatively or in conjunction with pancuronium bromide, unexpected prolongation of neuromuscular block should be considered a possibility.</p>

<h2>Other</h2>
<p class="First">Experience concerning injection of quinidine during recovery from use of other muscle relaxants suggests that recurrent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440377" conceptname="Paralysis">paralysis</span> may occur.

<h4>Pregnancy Category C</h4>
<p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been performed. It is not known whether pancuronium bromide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Pancuronium bromide should be given to a pregnant woman only if the administering clinician decides that the benefits outweigh the risks.</p>
<p>Pancuronium bromide may be used in operative obstetrics<span class="Italics"> (Caesarean section)</span>, but reversal of pancuronium may be unsatisfactory in patients receiving magnesium sulfate for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439393" conceptname="Pre-eclampsia">toxemia of pregnancy</span>, because magnesium salts enhance <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">neuromuscular blockade</span>. Dosage should usually be reduced, as indicated, in such cases. It is also recommended that the interval between use of pancuronium and delivery be reasonably short to avoid clinically significant placental transfer.</p>

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Dose response studies in children indicate that, with the exception of neonates, dosage requirements are the same as for adults. Due to the potential toxicity of benzyl alcohol in neonates, solutions containing benzyl alcohol must not be used in this patient population (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_contraindications_id_5672fb67-e24f-4ccc-a9bf-afb39dfdf9bc">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span>). </p>

Benzyl alcohol, a component of this product, has been associated with serious adverse events and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>, particularly in pediatric patients. The â€œgasping syndromeâ€?, (characterized by central nervous system <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">gasping</span> respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites found in the blood and urine) has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages &gt;99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low-birth-weight neonates.

Although normal therapeutic doses of this product deliver amounts of benzyl alcohol that are substantially lower than those reported in association with the â€œgasping syndromeâ€?, the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Premature and low-birth-weight infants, as well as patients receiving high dosages, may be more likely to develop toxicity. Practitioners administering this and other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources. </p>

<h2>Neuromuscular</h2>
<p class="First">The most frequent adverse reaction to nondepolarizing blocking agents as a class consists of an extension of the drug's pharmacological action beyond the time period needed. This may vary from skeletal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79908" conceptname="Muscle weakness">muscle weakness</span> to profound and prolonged <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440377" conceptname="Paralysis">skeletal muscle paralysis</span> resulting in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318459" conceptname="Respiratory insufficiency">respiratory insufficiency</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span>.</p>
<p>Inadequate reversal of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">neuromuscular blockade</span> is possible with pancuronium bromide as with all curariform drugs.

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">The possibility of iatrogenic overdosage can be minimized by carefully monitoring the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4247265" conceptname="Muscle twitch">muscle twitch</span> response to peripheral nerve stimulation.</p>
<p>Excessive doses of pancuronium bromide produce enhanced pharmacological effects. Residual <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">neuromuscular blockade</span> beyond the time period needed may occur with pancuronium bromide as with other neuromuscular blockers. This may be manifested by skeletal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79908" conceptname="Muscle weakness">muscle weakness</span>, decreased respiratory reserve, low tidal volume, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span>. A peripheral nerve stimulator may be used to assess the degree of residual <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">neuromuscular blockade</span> and help to differentiate residual <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">neuromuscular blockade</span> from other causes of decreased respiratory reserve.</p>
<p>Pyridostigmine bromide injection, neostigmine, or edrophonium, in conjunction with atropine or glycopyrrolate, will usually antagonize the skeletal muscle relaxant action of pancuronium bromide. Satisfactory reversal can be judged by adequacy of skeletal muscle tone and by adequacy of respiration. A peripheral nerve stimulator may also be used to monitor restoration of twitch response.</p>
<p>Failure of prompt reversal (within 30 minutes) may occur in the presence of extreme debilitation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4116496" conceptname="Disseminated adenocarcinoma">carcinomatosis</span>, and with concomitant use of certain broad spectrum antibiotics, or anesthetic agents and other drugs which enhance <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">neuromuscular blockade</span> or cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> of their own. Under such circumstances, the management is the same as that of prolonged <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">neuromuscular blockade</span>. Ventilation must be supported by artificial means until the patient has resumed control of his respiration. Prior to the use of reversal agents, reference should be made to the specific package insert of the reversal agent.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">NOTE: CONTAINS BENZYL ALCOHOL (see <a href="#i4i_contraindications_id_5672fb67-e24f-4ccc-a9bf-afb39dfdf9bc">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>, <a href="#i4i_warnings_ID_warnings">WARNINGS</a> and <span class="Italics"><a href="#i4i_pediatric_use_ID_p_peds">PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use</a></span>)</span></p>
<p>Pancuronium bromide injection is for intravenous use only. This drug should be administered by or under the supervision of experienced clinicians familiar with the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED IN EACH CASE. The dosage information which follows is derived from studies based upon units of drug per unit of body weight and is intended to serve as a guide only. Since potent inhalational anesthetics or prior use of succinylcholine may enhance the intensity and duration of pancuronium bromide (see<span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_interactions_ID_di"> PRECAUTIONSâ€”Drug Interactions</a></span>), the lower end of the recommended initial dosage range may suffice when pancuronium bromide is first used after intubation with succinylcholine and/or after maintenance doses of volatile liquid inhalational anesthetics are started. To obtain maximum clinical benefits of pancuronium bromide injection and to minimize the possibility of overdosage, the monitoring of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4247265" conceptname="Muscle twitch">muscle twitch</span> response to a peripheral nerve stimulator is advised.</p>
<p>In adults under balanced anesthesia the initial intravenous dosage range is 0.04 to 0.1 mg/kg. Later incremental doses starting at 0.01 mg/kg may be used. These increments slightly increase the magnitude of the blockade and significantly increase the duration of blockade, because a significant number of myoneural junctions are still blocked when there is clinical need for more drug.</p>
<p>If pancuronium bromide injection is used to provide skeletal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">muscle relaxation</span> for endotracheal intubation, a bolus dose of 0.06 to 0.1 mg/kg is recommended. Conditions satisfactory in intubation are usually present within 2 to 3 minutes. (See<span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_precautions_ID_precautions">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>.)</p>

<h2>Dosage in Children</h2>
<p class="First">Dose response studies in children indicate that, with the exception of neonates, dosage requirements are the same as for adults. Due to the potential toxicity of benzyl alcohol in neonates, solutions containing benzyl alcohol must not be used in this patient population (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_contraindications_id_5672fb67-e24f-4ccc-a9bf-afb39dfdf9bc">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span>). </p>
