<h2>Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</h2>
<p class="First">The pharmacokinetic properties of fluconazole are similar following administration by the intravenous or oral routes. In normal volunteers, the bioavailability of orally administered fluconazole is over 90% compared with intravenous administration. Bioequivalence was established between the 100 mg tablet and both suspension strengths when administered as a single 200 mg dose.<br><br>Peak plasma concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) in fasted normal volunteers occur between 1 and 2 hours with a terminal plasma elimination half-life of approximately 30 hours (range: 20 to 50 hours) after oral administration.<br><br>In fasted normal volunteers, administration of a single oral 400 mg dose of fluconazole leads to a mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> of 6.72 mcg/mL (range: 4.12 to 8.08 mcg/mL) and after single oral doses of 50 to 400 mg, fluconazole plasma concentrations and AUC (area under the plasma concentration-time curve) are dose proportional.<br><br>The C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC data from a food-effect study involving administration of fluconazole tablets to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and with a high-fat meal indicated that exposure to the drug is not affected by food. Therefore, fluconazole may be taken without regard to meals. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#dad">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>.)<br><br>Administration of a single oral 150 mg tablet of fluconazole to ten lactating women resulted in a mean C<span class="Sub">max </span>of 2.61 mcg/mL (range: 1.57 to 3.65 mcg/mL).<br><br>Steady-state concentrations are reached within 5 to 10 days following oral doses of 50 to 400 mg given once daily. Administration of a loading dose (on day 1) of twice the usual daily dose results in plasma concentrations close to steady-state by the second day. The apparent volume of distribution of fluconazole approximates that of total body water. Plasma protein binding is low (11 to 12%). Following either single- or multiple oral doses for up to 14 days, fluconazole penetrates into all body fluids studied (see table below). In normal volunteers, saliva concentrations of fluconazole were equal to or slightly greater than plasma concentrations regardless of dose, route, or duration of dosing. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256449" conceptname="Bronchiectasis">bronchiectasis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4102774" conceptname="Productive cough">sputum</span> concentrations of fluconazole following a single 150 mg oral dose were equal to plasma concentrations at both 4 and 24 hours post dose. In patients with fungal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435785" conceptname="Meningitis">meningitis</span>, fluconazole concentrations in the CSF are approximately 80% of the corresponding plasma concentrations.<br><br>A single oral 150 mg dose of fluconazole administered to 27 patients penetrated into vaginal tissue, resulting in tissue:plasma ratios ranging from 0.94 to 1.14 over the first 48 hours following dosing.<br><br>A single oral 150 mg dose of fluconazole administered to 14 patients penetrated into vaginal fluid, resulting in fluid:plasma ratios ranging from 0.36 to 0.71 over the first 72 hours following dosing. </p>

<p>In normal volunteers, fluconazole is cleared primarily by renal excretion, with approximately 80% of the administered dose appearing in the urine as unchanged drug. About 11% of the dose is excreted in the urine as metabolites.<br><br>The pharmacokinetics of fluconazole are markedly affected by reduction in renal function. There is an inverse relationship between the elimination half-life and creatinine clearance.

<h2>Pharmacokinetics in Elderly</h2>
<p class="First">A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 22 subjects, 65 years of age or older receiving a single 50 mg oral dose of fluconazole. Ten of these patients were concomitantly receiving diuretics. The C<span class="Sub">max</span> was 1.54 mcg/mL and occurred at 1.3 hours post dose. The mean AUC was 76.4 ± 20.3 mcg•h/mL, and the mean terminal half-life was 46.2 hours. These pharmacokinetic parameter values are higher than analogous values reported for normal young male volunteers. Coadministration of diuretics did not significantly alter AUC or C<span class="Sub">max</span>. In addition, creatinine clearance (74 mL/min), the percent of drug recovered unchanged in urine (0 to 24 hr, 22%), and the fluconazole renal clearance estimates (0.124 mL/min/kg) for the elderly were generally lower than those of younger volunteers. Thus, the alteration of fluconazole disposition in the elderly appears to be related to reduced renal function characteristic of this group. A plot of each subject’s terminal elimination half-life versus creatinine clearance compared with the predicted half-life – creatinine clearance curve derived from normal subjects and subjects with varying degrees of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> indicated that 21 of 22 subjects fell within the 95% confidence limit of the predicted half-life – creatinine clearance curves. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that higher values for the pharmacokinetic parameters observed in the elderly subjects compared with normal young male volunteers are due to the decreased kidney function that is expected in the elderly.</p>

<h2>Drug Interaction Studies</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Oral contraceptives: </span>Oral contraceptives were administered as a single dose both before and after the oral administration of fluconazole 50 mg once daily for 10 days in 10 healthy women.<br><br>There was no significant difference in ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel AUC after the administration of 50 mg of fluconazole. The mean increase in ethinyl estradiol AUC was 6% (range: –47 to 108%) and levonorgestrel AUC increased 17% (range: –33 to 141%).<br><br>In a second study, twenty-five normal females received daily doses of both 200 mg fluconazole tablets or placebo for two, ten-day periods. The treatment cycles were one month apart with all subjects receiving fluconazole during one cycle and placebo during the other. The order of study treatment was random. Single doses of an oral contraceptive tablet containing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol were administered on the final treatment day (day 10) of both cycles. Following administration of 200 mg of fluconazole, the mean percentage increase of AUC for levonorgestrel compared to placebo was 25% (range: –12 to 82%) and the mean percentage increase for ethinyl estradiol compared to placebo was 38% (range: –11 to 101%).  Both of these increases were statistically significantly different from placebo.<br><br>A third study evaluated the potential interaction of once weekly dosing of fluconazole 300 mg to 21 normal females taking an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone. In this placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, two-way crossover study carried out over three cycles of oral contraceptive treatment, fluconazole dosing resulted in small increases in the mean AUCs of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone compared to similar placebo dosing. The mean AUCs of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone increased by 24% (95% C.I. range: 18 to 31%) and 13% (95% C.I. range: 8 to 18%), respectively, relative to placebo. Fluconazole treatment did not cause a decrease in the ethinyl estradiol AUC of any individual subject in this study compared to placebo dosing. The individual AUC values of norethindrone decreased very slightly (&lt;5%) in 3 of the 21 subjects after fluconazole treatment.<br><br><span class="Italics">Cimetidine:  </span>Fluconazole 100 mg was administered as a single oral dose alone and two hours after a single dose of cimetidine 400 mg to six healthy male volunteers. After the administration of cimetidine, there was a significant decrease in fluconazole AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span>. There was a mean ± SD decrease in fluconazole AUC of 13% ± 11% (range: –3.4 to –31%) and C<span class="Sub">max</span> decreased 19% ± 14% (range: –5 to –40%). However, the administration of cimetidine 600 mg to 900 mg intravenously over a four-hour period (from one hour before to 3 hours after a single oral dose of fluconazole 200 mg) did not affect the bioavailability or pharmacokinetics of fluconazole in 24 healthy male volunteers.<br><br><span class="Italics">Antacid: </span>Administration of Maalox® (20 mL) to 14 normal male volunteers immediately prior to   a single dose of fluconazole 100 mg had no effect on the absorption or elimination of fluconazole.<br><br><span class="Italics">Hydrochlorothiazide: </span>Concomitant oral administration of 100 mg fluconazole and 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide for 10 days in 13 normal volunteers resulted in a significant increase in fluconazole AUC and C<span class="Sub">max </span>compared to fluconazole given alone. There was a mean ± SD increase in fluconazole AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of 45% ± 31% (range: 19 to 114%) and 43% ± 31% (range: 19 to 122%), respectively. These changes are attributed to a mean ± SD reduction in renal clearance of 30% ± 12% (range: –10 to –50%).<br><br><span class="Italics">Rifampin: </span>Administration of a single oral 200 mg dose of fluconazole after 15 days of rifampin administered as 600 mg daily in eight healthy male volunteers resulted in a significant decrease in fluconazole AUC and a significant increase in apparent oral clearance of fluconazole. There was a mean ± SD reduction in fluconazole AUC of 23% ± 9% (range: –13 to –42%). Apparent oral clearance of fluconazole increased 32% ± 17% (range: 16 to 72%). Fluconazole half-life decreased from 33.4 ± 4.4 hours to 26.8 ± 3.9 hours. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_6">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>.)</p>

There was a significant increase in phenytoin AUC. The mean ± SD increase in phenytoin AUC was 88% ± 68% (range: 16 to 247%).

Two groups of 10 normal subjects were administered fluconazole 200 mg daily or placebo. Cisapride 20 mg four times daily was started after 7 days of fluconazole or placebo dosing. Following a single dose of fluconazole, there was a 101% increase in the cisapride AUC and a 91% increase in the cisapride C<span class="Sub">max</span>. Following multiple doses of fluconazole, there was a 192% increase in the cisapride AUC and a 154% increase in the cisapride C<span class="Sub">max</span>. Fluconazole significantly increased the QTc interval in subjects receiving cisapride 20 mg four times daily for 5 days.

In the study, subjects ingested placebo or 400 mg fluconazole on Day 1 followed by 200 mg daily from Day 2 to Day 6. In addition, a 7.5 mg dose of midazolam was orally ingested on the first day, 0.05 mg/kg was administered intravenously on the fourth day, and 7.5 mg orally on the sixth day. Fluconazole reduced the clearance of IV midazolam by 51%. On the first day of dosing, fluconazole increased the midazolam AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 259% and 150%, respectively. On the sixth day of dosing, fluconazole increased the midazolam AUC and C<span class="Sub">max </span>by 259% and 74%, respectively. The psychomotor effects of midazolam were significantly increased after oral administration of midazolam but not significantly affected following intravenous midazolam.<br><br>A second randomized, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, cross over study in three phases was performed to determine the effect of route of administration of fluconazole on the interaction between fluconazole and midazolam. In each phase the subjects were given oral fluconazole 400 mg and intravenous saline; oral placebo and intravenous fluconazole 400 mg; and oral placebo and IV saline. An oral dose of 7.5 mg of midazolam was ingested after fluconazole/placebo. The AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of midazolam were significantly higher after oral than IV administration of fluconazole. Oral fluconazole increased the midazolam AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 272% and 129%, respectively. IV fluconazole increased the midazolam AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 244% and 79%, respectively. Both oral and IV fluconazole increased the pharmacodynamic effects of midazolam.

Concurrent administration of oral voriconazole (400 mg Q 12 h for 1 day, then 200 mg Q 12 h for 2.5 days) and oral fluconazole (400 mg on day 1, then 200 mg Q 24 h for 4 days) to 6 healthy male subjects resulted in an increase in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">τ</span> of voriconazole by an average of 57% (90% CI: 20%, 107%) and 79% (90% CI: 40%, 128%), respectively. In a follow-on clinical study involving 8 healthy male subjects, reduced dosing and/or frequency of voriconazole and fluconazole did not eliminate or diminish this effect. Concomitant administration of voriconazole and fluconazole at any dose is not recommended. Close monitoring for adverse events related to voriconazole is recommended if voriconazole is used sequentially after fluconazole, especially within 24 h of the last dose of fluconazole.

<h3><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></h3>
<p class="First">Fluconazole is a highly selective inhibitor of fungal cytochrome P450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14-α-demethylase. This enzyme functions to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. The subsequent loss of normal sterols correlates with the accumulation of 14-α-methyl sterols in fungi and may be responsible for the fungistatic activity of fluconazole. Mammalian cell demethylation is much less sensitive to fluconazole inhibition.<br><br><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4150981" conceptname="Drug resistance">Drug Resistance</span><br><br>Fluconazole resistance may arise from a modification in the quality or quantity of the target enzyme (lanosterol 14-α-demethylase), reduced access to the drug target, or some combination of these mechanisms.<br><br>Point mutations in the gene (ERG11) encoding for the target enzyme lead to an altered target with decreased affinity for azoles. Overexpression of ERG11 results in the production of high concentrations of the target enzyme, creating the need for higher intracellular drug concentrations to inhibit all of the enzyme molecules in the cell.<br><br>The second major mechanism of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4150981" conceptname="Drug resistance">drug resistance</span> involves active efflux of fluconazole out of the cell through the activation of two types of multidrug efflux transporters; the major facilitators (encoded by MDR genes) and those of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily (encoded by CDR genes). Upregulation of the MDR gene leads to fluconazole resistance, whereas, upregulation of CDR genes may lead to resistance to multiple azoles.<br><br>Resistance in <span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433968" conceptname="Candidiasis">Candida</span> glabrata</span> usually includes upregulation of CDR genes resulting in resistance to multiple azoles.

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">(See <a href="#Section_2.4">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interaction Studies</a> and <a href="#Section_4">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>.) Fluconazole is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 2C9 and a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4. In addition to the observed/documented interactions mentioned below, there is a risk of increased plasma concentration of other compounds metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 coadministered with fluconazole. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these combinations and the patients should be carefully monitored. The enzyme inhibiting effect of fluconazole persists 4 to 5 days after discontinuation of fluconazole treatment due to the long half-life of fluconazole. Clinically or potentially significant drug interactions between fluconazole and the following agents/classes have been observed. These are described in greater detail below:<br><br>        Oral hypoglycemics<br>        Coumarin-type anticoagulants<br>        Phenytoin<br>        Cyclosporine<br>        Rifampin<br>        Theophylline<br>        Terfenadine<br>        Cisapride<br>        Astemizole<br>        Rifabutin<br>        Voriconazole<br>        Tacrolimus<br>        Short-acting benzodiazepines<br>        Tofacitinib<br>        Triazolam<br>        Oral Contraceptives<br>        Pimozide<br>        Quinidine<br>        Hydrochlorothiazide<br>        Alfentanil<br>        Amitriptyline, nortriptyline<br>        Amphotericin B<br>        Azithromycin<br>        Carbamazepine<br>        Calcium Channel Blockers<br>        Celecoxib<br>        Cyclophosphamide<br>        Fentanyl<br>        Halofantrine<br>        HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors<br>        Losartan<br>        Methadone<br>        Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs<br>        Prednisone<br>        Saquinavir<br>        Sirolimus<br>        Vinca Alkaloids<br>        Vitamin A<br>        Zidovudine<br><br><span class="Italics">Oral hypoglycemics:</span> Clinically significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> may be precipitated by the use of fluconazole with oral hypoglycemic agents; one fatality has been reported from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> in association with combined fluconazole and glyburide use. Fluconazole reduces the metabolism of tolbutamide, glyburide, and glipizide and increases the plasma concentration of these agents.

One study at a 200 mg daily dose of fluconazole failed to demonstrate a prolongation in QTc interval. Another study at a 400 mg and 800 mg daily dose of fluconazole demonstrated that fluconazole taken in doses of 400 mg per day or greater significantly increases plasma levels of terfenadine when taken concomitantly. The combined use of fluconazole at doses of 400 mg or greater with terfenadine is contraindicated.

This effect on midazolam appears to be more pronounced following oral administration of fluconazole than with fluconazole administered intravenously. If short-acting benzodiazepines, which are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, are concomitantly administered with fluconazole, consideration should be given to decreasing the benzodiazepine dosage, and the patients should be appropriately monitored.

In an intravenous perinatal study in rats at 5, 20, and 40 mg/kg, dystocia and prolongation of parturition were observed in a few dams at 20 mg/kg (approximately 5 to 15 times the recommended human dose) and 40 mg/kg, but not at 5 mg/kg. The disturbances in parturition were reflected by a slight increase in the number of still born pups and decrease of neonatal survival at these dose levels. The effects on parturition in rats are consistent with the species specific estrogen-lowering property produced by high doses of fluconazole. Such a hormone change has not been observed in women treated with fluconazole. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_2">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span>.)</p>

Because of the voluntary nature of the reports and the natural increase in the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> in the elderly, it is however not possible to establish a casual relationship to drug exposure.<br><br>Controlled clinical trials of fluconazole did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to evaluate whether they respond differently from younger patients in each indication. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.<br><br>Fluconazole is primarily cleared by renal excretion as unchanged drug. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken to adjust dose based on creatinine clearance. It may be useful to monitor renal function.
