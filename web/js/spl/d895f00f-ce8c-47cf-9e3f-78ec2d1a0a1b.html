<h1>ACTIONS / CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="43679-0">
<a name="section-3.1"></a><p></p>
<p class="First">Spironolactone is a specific pharmacologic antagonist of aldosterone, acting primarily through competitive binding of receptors at the aldosterone-dependent sodium-potassium exchange site in the distal convoluted renal tubule. Spironolactone causes increased amounts of sodium and water to be excreted, while potassium is retained. Spironolactone acts both as a diuretic and as an antihypertensive drug by this mechanism. It may be given alone or with other diuretic agents that act more proximally in the renal tubule.
                                    <span class="Italics">Mechanism of action:</span></p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-3.2"></a><p></p>
<p class="First">Increased levels of the mineralocorticoid, aldosterone, are present in primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism. Edematous states in which secondary aldosteronism is usually involved include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4064161" conceptname="Cirrhosis of liver">hepatic cirrhosis</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="195314" conceptname="Nephrotic syndrome">nephrotic syndrome</span>. By competing with aldosterone for receptor sites, spironolactone provides effective therapy for the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200528" conceptname="Ascites">ascites</span> in those conditions. Spironolactone counteracts secondary aldosteronism induced by the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436375" conceptname="Hypovolemia">volume depletion</span> and associated sodium loss caused by active diuretic therapy.
                                    <span class="Italics">Aldosterone antagonist activity:</span></p>

<p class="First">Spironolactone is rapidly and extensively metabolized. Sulfur-containing products are the predominant metabolites and are thought to be primarily responsible, together with spironolactone, for the therapeutic effects of the drug. The following pharmacokinetic data were obtained from 12 healthy volunteers following the administration of 100 mg of spironolactone (as tablets) daily for 15 days. On the 15th day, spironolactone was given immediately after a low-fat breakfast and blood was drawn thereafter.

<p>The pharmacological activity of spironolactone metabolites in man is not known. However, in the adrenalectomized rat the antimineralocorticoid activities of the metabolites C, TMS, and HTMS, relative to spironolactone were 1.10, 1.28, and 0.32, respectively. Relative to spironolactone, their binding affinities to the aldosterone receptors in rat kidney slices were 0.19, 0.86, and 0.06, respectively.</p>
<p>In humans, the potencies of TMS and 7-α-thiospirolactone in reversing the effects of the synthetic mineralocorticoid, fludrocortisone, on urinary electrolyte composition were 0.33 and 0.26, respectively, relative to spironolactone. However, since the serum concentrations of these steroids were not determined, their incomplete absorption and/or first-pass metabolism could not be ruled out as a reason for their reduced activities.
                                    <span class="Italics">in vivo</span></p>
<p>Spironolactone and its metabolites are more than 90% bound to plasma proteins. The metabolites are excreted primarily in the urine and secondarily in bile.</p>
<p>The effect of food on spironolactone absorption (two 100 mg spironolactone tablets) was assessed in a single-dose study of 9 healthy, drug-free volunteers. Food increased the bioavailability of unmetabolized spironolactone by almost 100%. The clinical importance of this finding is not known.</p>

<p class="First">The Randomized Spironolactone Evaluation Study was a multinational, double-blind study in patients with an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4108582" conceptname="Left ventricular ejection fraction">ejection fraction</span> of ≤35%, a history of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> within 6 months, and class III – IV <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> at the time of randomization. All patients were required to be taking a loop diuretic and, if tolerated, an ACE inhibitor. Patients with a baseline serum creatinine of &gt;2.5 mg/dL or a recent increase of 25% or with a baseline serum potassium of &gt;5.0 mEq/L were excluded.
                                    <span class="Italics">Severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>:</span></p>
<p>Patients were randomized 1:1 to spironolactone 25 mg orally once daily or matching placebo. Follow-up visits and laboratory measurements (including serum potassium and creatinine) were performed every four weeks for the first 12 weeks, then every 3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months thereafter. Dosing could be withheld for serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span> or if the serum creatinine increased to &gt;4.0 mg/dL. Patients who were intolerant of the initial dosage regimen had their dose decreased to one tablet every other day at one to four weeks. Patients who were tolerant of one tablet daily at 8 weeks may have had their dose increased to two tablets daily at the discretion of the investigator.</p>
<p>Randomized Spironolactone Evaluation Study enrolled 1663 patients (3% U.S.) at 195 centers in 15 countries between March 24, 1995 and December 31, 1996. The study population was primarily white (87%, with 7% black, 2% Asian, and 4% other), male (73%), and elderly (median age 67). The median <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4108582" conceptname="Left ventricular ejection fraction">ejection fraction</span> was 0.26. Seventy percent were NYHA class III and 29% class IV. The presumed etiology of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> was ischemic in 55%, and non-ischemic in 45%. There was a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> in 28%, of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> in 24%, and of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> in 22%. The median baseline serum creatinine was 1.2 mg/dL and the median baseline creatinine clearance was 57 mL/min. The mean daily dose at study end for the patients randomized to spironolactone was 26 mg.</p>
<p>Concomitant medications included a loop diuretic in 100% of patients and an ACE inhibitor in 97%. Other medications used at any time during the study included digoxin (78%), anticoagulants (58%), aspirin (43%), and beta-blockers (15%).</p>
<p>The primary endpoint for Randomized Spironolactone Evaluation Study was time to all-cause mortality. Randomized Spironolactone Evaluation Study was terminated early, after a mean follow-up of 24 months, because of significant mortality benefit detected on a planned interim analysis. The survival curves by treatment group are shown in Figure 1.</p>

<p>Mortality hazard ratios for some subgroups are shown in Figure 2. The favorable effect of spironolactone on mortality appeared similar for both genders and all age groups except patients younger than 55; there were too few non-whites in Randomized Spironolactone Evaluation Study to draw any conclusions about differential effects by race.

<p>Spironolactone is indicated for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">strokes</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarctions</span>. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes.</p>
<p>Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).</p>
<p>Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, but reductions in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.</p>
<p>Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> (for example, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432867" conceptname="Hyperlipidemia">hyperlipidemia</span>), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.</p>
<p>Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.</p>
<p>Usually in combination with other drugs, spironolactone is indicated for patients who cannot be treated adequately with other agents or for whom other agents are considered inappropriate.</p>

<p>In a three-litter reproduction study in which female rats received dietary doses of 15 and 50 mg spironolactone/kg/day, there were no effects on mating and fertility, but there was a small increase in incidence of stillborn pups at 50 mg/kg/day. When injected into female rats (100 mg/kg/day for 7 days, i.p.), spironolactone was found to increase the length of the estrous cycle by prolonging diestrus during treatment and inducing constant diestrus during a two-week post-treatment observation period. These effects were associated with retarded ovarian follicle development and a reduction in circulating estrogen levels, which would be expected to impair mating, fertility, and fecundity. Spironolactone (100 mg/kg/day), administered i.p. to female mice during a two-week cohabitation period with untreated males, decreased the number of mated mice that conceived (effect shown to be caused by an inhibition of ovulation) and decreased the number of implanted embryos in those that became pregnant (effect shown to be caused by an inhibition of implantation), and at 200 mg/kg, also increased the latency period to mating.</p>

<p class="First">Pregnancy Category C. Teratology studies with spironolactone have been carried out in mice and rabbits at doses of up to 20 mg/kg/day. On a body surface area basis, this dose in the mouse is substantially below the maximum recommended human dose and, in the rabbit, approximates the maximum recommended human dose. No teratogenic or other embryotoxic effects were observed in mice, but the 20 mg/kg dose caused an increased rate of resorption and a lower number of live fetuses in rabbits. Because of its antiandrogenic activity and the requirement of testosterone for male morphogenesis, spironolactone may have the potential for adversely affecting sex differentiation of the male during embryogenesis. When administered to rats at 200 mg/kg/day between gestation days 13 and 21 (late embryogenesis and fetal development), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4140373" conceptname="Feminized male">feminization</span> of male fetuses was observed. Offspring exposed during late pregnancy to 50 and 100 mg/kg/day doses of spironolactone exhibited changes in the reproductive tract including dose-dependent decreases in weights of the ventral prostate and seminal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443720" conceptname="Blister">vesicle</span> in males, ovaries and uteri that were enlarged in females, and other indications of endocrine dysfunction, that persisted into adulthood. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with spironolactone in pregnant women. Spironolactone has known endocrine effects in animals including progestational and antiandrogenic effects. The antiandrogenic effects can result in apparent estrogenic side effects in humans, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168447" conceptname="Gynecomastia">gynecomastia</span>. Therefore, the use of spironolactone in pregnant women requires that the anticipated benefit be weighed against the possible hazards to the fetus.

<p class="First">Canrenone, a major (and active) metabolite of spironolactone, appears in human breast milk. Because spironolactone has been found to be tumorigenic in rats, a decision should be made whether to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. If use of the drug is deemed essential, an alternative method of infant feeding should be instituted.
