<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">The efficacy of paroxetine in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440374" conceptname="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">obsessive compulsive disorder</span> (OCD), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> (PD), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434613" conceptname="Generalized anxiety disorder">generalized anxiety disorder</span> (GAD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system resulting from inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5‑hydroxy‑tryptamine, 5‑HT). Studies at clinically relevant doses in humans have demonstrated that paroxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. In vitro studies in animals also suggest that paroxetine is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake. In vitro radioligand binding studies indicate that paroxetine has little affinity for muscarinic, alpha<span class="Sub">1</span>-, alpha<span class="Sub">2</span>-, beta-adrenergic-, dopamine (D<span class="Sub">2</span>)-, 5‑HT<span class="Sub">1</span>-, 5‑HT<span class="Sub">2</span>-, and histamine (H<span class="Sub">1</span>)‑receptors; antagonism of muscarinic, histaminergic, and alpha<span class="Sub">1</span>-adrenergic receptors has been associated with various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular effects for other psychotropic drugs.</p>
<p>Because the relative potencies of paroxetine’s major metabolites are at most 1/50 of the parent compound, they are essentially inactive.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Paroxetine hydrochloride is completely absorbed after oral dosing of a solution of the hydrochloride salt. The mean elimination half-life is approximately 21 hours (CV 32%) after oral dosing of 30 mg tablets of PAXIL daily for 30 days. Paroxetine is extensively metabolized and the metabolites are considered to be inactive. Nonlinearity in pharmacokinetics is observed with increasing doses. Paroxetine metabolism is mediated in part by CYP2D6, and the metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine and to some extent in the feces. Pharmacokinetic behavior of paroxetine has not been evaluated in subjects who are deficient in CYP2D6 (poor metabolizers).</p>
<p>In a meta-analysis of paroxetine from 4 studies done in healthy volunteers following multiple dosing of 20 mg/day to 40 mg/day, males did not exhibit a significantly lower C<span class="Sub">max</span> or AUC than females.</p>

<h3>Absorption and Distribution</h3>
<p class="First">Paroxetine is equally bioavailable from the oral suspension and tablet.</p>
<p>Paroxetine hydrochloride is completely absorbed after oral dosing of a solution of the hydrochloride salt. In a study in which normal male subjects (n = 15) received 30 mg tablets daily for 30 days, steady‑state paroxetine concentrations were achieved by approximately 10 days for most subjects, although it may take substantially longer in an occasional patient. At steady state, mean values of C<span class="Sub">max</span>, T<span class="Sub">max</span>, C<span class="Sub">min</span>, and T<span class="Sub">½</span> were 61.7 ng/mL (CV 45%), 5.2 hr. (CV 10%), 30.7 ng/mL (CV 67%), and 21.0 hours (CV 32%), respectively. The steady‑state C<span class="Sub">max</span> and C<span class="Sub">min</span> values were about 6 and 14 times what would be predicted from single‑dose studies. Steady‑state drug exposure based on AUC<span class="Sub">0-24</span> was about 8 times greater than would have been predicted from single-dose data in these subjects. The excess accumulation is a consequence of the fact that 1 of the enzymes that metabolizes paroxetine is readily saturable.</p>
<p>The effects of food on the bioavailability of paroxetine were studied in subjects administered a single dose with and without food. AUC was only slightly increased (6%) when drug was administered with food but the C<span class="Sub">max</span> was 29% greater, while the time to reach peak plasma concentration decreased from 6.4 hours post‑dosing to 4.9 hours.</p>
<p>Paroxetine distributes throughout the body, including the CNS, with only 1% remaining in the plasma.</p>
<p>Approximately 95% and 93% of paroxetine is bound to plasma protein at 100 ng/mL and 400 ng/mL, respectively. Under clinical conditions, paroxetine concentrations would normally be less than 400 ng/mL. Paroxetine does not alter the in vitro protein binding of phenytoin or warfarin.</p>

<h3>Metabolism and Excretion</h3>
<p class="First">The mean elimination half-life is approximately 21 hours (CV 32%) after oral dosing of 30 mg tablets daily for 30 days of PAXIL. In steady‑state dose proportionality studies involving elderly and nonelderly patients, at doses of 20 mg to 40 mg daily for the elderly and 20 mg to 50 mg daily for the nonelderly, some nonlinearity was observed in both populations, again reflecting a saturable metabolic pathway. In comparison to C<span class="Sub">min</span> values after 20 mg daily, values after 40 mg daily were only about 2 to 3 times greater than doubled.</p>
<p>Paroxetine is extensively metabolized after oral administration. The principal metabolites are polar and conjugated products of oxidation and methylation, which are readily cleared. Conjugates with glucuronic acid and sulfate predominate, and major metabolites have been isolated and identified. Data indicate that the metabolites have no more than 1/50 the potency of the parent compound at inhibiting serotonin uptake. The metabolism of paroxetine is accomplished in part by CYP2D6. Saturation of this enzyme at clinical doses appears to account for the nonlinearity of paroxetine kinetics with increasing dose and increasing duration of treatment. The role of this enzyme in paroxetine metabolism also suggests potential drug‑drug interactions (see PRECAUTIONS: Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6).</p>
<p>Approximately 64% of a 30-mg oral solution dose of paroxetine was excreted in the urine with 2% as the parent compound and 62% as metabolites over a 10‑day post‑dosing period. About 36% was excreted in the feces (probably via the bile), mostly as metabolites and less than 1% as the parent compound over the 10‑day post‑dosing period.</p>

<h3>Renal and Liver Disease</h3>
<p class="First">Increased plasma concentrations of paroxetine occur in subjects with renal and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>. The mean plasma concentrations in patients with creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min. were approximately 4 times greater than seen in normal volunteers. Patients with creatinine clearance of 30 to 60 mL/min. and patients with hepatic functional impairment had about a 2‑fold increase in plasma concentrations (AUC, C<span class="Sub">max</span>).</p>
<p>The initial dosage should therefore be reduced in patients with severe renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>, and upward titration, if necessary, should be at increased intervals (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</p>

<h3>Elderly Patients</h3>
<p class="First">In a multiple‑dose study in the elderly at daily paroxetine doses of 20, 30, and 40 mg, C<span class="Sub">min</span> concentrations were about 70% to 80% greater than the respective C<span class="Sub">min</span> concentrations in nonelderly subjects. Therefore the initial dosage in the elderly should be reduced (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</p>

<h3>Drug-Drug Interactions</h3>
<p class="First">In vitro drug interaction studies reveal that paroxetine inhibits CYP2D6. Clinical drug interaction studies have been performed with substrates of CYP2D6 and show that paroxetine can inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 including desipramine, risperidone, and atomoxetine (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).</p>

<h2>Major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depressive Disorder</span></h2>
<p class="First">The efficacy of PAXIL as a treatment for major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> has been established in 6 placebo‑controlled studies of patients with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (aged 18 to 73). In these studies, PAXIL was shown to be significantly more effective than placebo in treating major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> by at least 2 of the following measures: Hamilton <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> Rating Scale (HDRS), the Hamilton <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="40546087" conceptname="Depressed mood">depressed mood</span> item, and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)‑Severity of Illness. PAXIL was significantly better than placebo in improvement of the HDRS sub‑factor scores, including the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="40546087" conceptname="Depressed mood">depressed mood</span> item, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435524" conceptname="Sleep disorder">sleep disturbance</span> factor, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> factor.</p>
<p>A study of outpatients with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> who had responded to PAXIL (HDRS total score &lt;8) during an initial 8‑week open‑treatment phase and were then randomized to continuation on PAXIL or placebo for 1 year demonstrated a significantly lower relapse rate for patients taking PAXIL (15%) compared to those on placebo (39%). Effectiveness was similar for male and female patients.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440374" conceptname="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">Obsessive Compulsive Disorder</span></h2>
<p class="First">The effectiveness of PAXIL in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440374" conceptname="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">obsessive compulsive disorder</span> (OCD) was demonstrated in two 12‑week multicenter placebo-controlled studies of adult outpatients (Studies 1 and 2). Patients in all studies had moderate to severe OCD (DSM‑IIIR) with mean baseline ratings on the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) total score ranging from 23 to 26. Study 1, a dose-range finding study where patients were treated with fixed doses of 20, 40, or 60 mg of paroxetine/day demonstrated that daily doses of paroxetine 40 and 60 mg are effective in the treatment of OCD. Patients receiving doses of 40 and 60 mg paroxetine experienced a mean reduction of approximately 6 and 7 points, respectively, on the YBOCS total score which was significantly greater than the approximate 4-point reduction at 20 mg and a 3-point reduction in the placebo‑treated patients. Study 2 was a flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine (20 to 60 mg daily) with clomipramine (25 to 250 mg daily). In this study, patients receiving paroxetine experienced a mean reduction of approximately 7 points on the YBOCS total score, which was significantly greater than the mean reduction of approximately 4 points in placebo‑treated patients.</p>

<h2>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder</h2>
<p class="First">The effectiveness of PAXIL in the treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) was demonstrated in two 12-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1 and 2) of adult outpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for PTSD. The mean duration of PTSD symptoms for the 2 studies combined was 13 years (ranging from .1 year to 57 years). The percentage of patients with secondary major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> or non-PTSD <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442077" conceptname="Anxiety disorder">anxiety disorders</span> in the combined 2 studies was 41% (356 out of 858 patients) and 40% (345 out of 858 patients), respectively. Study outcome was assessed by (i) the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale Part 2 (CAPS-2) score and (ii) the Clinical Global Impression-Global Improvement Scale (CGI-I). The CAPS-2 is a multi-item instrument that measures 3 aspects of PTSD with the following symptom clusters: Reexperiencing/intrusion, avoidance/numbing and hyperarousal. The 2 primary outcomes for each trial were (i) change from baseline to endpoint on the CAPS-2 total score (17 items), and (ii) proportion of responders on the CGI-I, where responders were defined as patients having a score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved).</p>
<p>Study 1 was a 12-week study comparing fixed paroxetine doses of 20 mg or 40 mg/day to placebo. Doses of 20 mg and 40 mg of PAXIL were demonstrated to be significantly superior to placebo on change from baseline for the CAPS-2 total score and on proportion of responders on the CGI-I. There was not sufficient evidence in this study to suggest a greater benefit for the 40 mg/day dose compared to the 20 mg/day dose.</p>
<p>Study 2 was a 12-week flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine (20 to 50 mg daily) to placebo. PAXIL was demonstrated to be significantly superior to placebo on change from baseline for the CAPS-2 total score and on proportion of responders on the CGI-I.</p>
<p>A third study, also a flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine (20 to 50 mg daily) to placebo, demonstrated PAXIL to be significantly superior to placebo on change from baseline for CAPS-2 total score, but not on proportion of responders on the CGI-I.</p>
<p>The majority of patients in these trials were women (68% women: 377 out of 551 subjects in Study 1 and 66% women: 202 out of 303 subjects in Study 2). Subgroup analyses did not indicate differences in treatment outcomes as a function of gender. There were an insufficient number of patients who were 65 years and older or were non-Caucasian to conduct subgroup analyses on the basis of age or race, respectively.</p>

<h2>Clinical Worsening and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> Risk:</h2>
<p class="First">Patients with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and/or the emergence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4092095" conceptname="Planning suicide">suicidal ideation</span> and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> is a known risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18-24) with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.</p>
<p>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440374" conceptname="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">obsessive compulsive disorder</span> (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1,000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1. </p>

<p>No <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>.</p>
<p>It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months.

Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.</p>
<p>Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient’s presenting symptoms.</p>
<p>If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Discontinuation of Treatment With PAXIL, for a description of the risks of discontinuation of PAXIL).</p>

<h2>Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder</h2>
<p class="First">A major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive episode</span> may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder.

<h3>Teratogenic Effects</h3>
<p class="First">Epidemiological studies have shown that infants exposed to paroxetine in the first trimester of pregnancy have an increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly cardiovascular malformations. The findings from these studies are summarized below:</p>
<dl>
<dt>•</dt>
<dd>A study based on Swedish national registry data demonstrated that infants exposed to paroxetine during pregnancy (n = 815) had an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations (2% risk in paroxetine-exposed infants) compared to the entire registry population (1% risk), for an odds ratio (OR) of 1.8 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.8). No increase in the risk of overall congenital malformations was seen in the paroxetine-exposed infants. The cardiac malformations in the paroxetine-exposed infants were primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434462" conceptname="Ventricular septal defect">ventricular septal defects</span> (VSDs) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4289309" conceptname="Atrial septal defect">atrial septal defects</span> (ASDs). Septal defects range in severity from those that resolve spontaneously to those which require surgery. </dd>
<dt>•</dt>
<dd>A separate retrospective cohort study from the United States (United Healthcare data) evaluated 5,956 infants of mothers dispensed antidepressants during the first trimester (n = 815 for paroxetine). This study showed a trend towards an increased risk for cardiovascular malformations for paroxetine (risk of 1.5%) compared to other antidepressants (risk of 1%), for an OR of 1.5 (95% confidence interval 0.8 to 2.9). Of the 12 paroxetine-exposed infants with cardiovascular malformations, 9 had VSDs. This study also suggested an increased risk of overall major congenital malformations including cardiovascular defects for paroxetine (4% risk) compared to other (2% risk) antidepressants (OR 1.8; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.8). </dd>
<dt>•</dt>
<dd>Two large case-control studies using separate databases, each with &gt;9,000 birth defect cases and &gt;4,000 controls, found that maternal use of paroxetine during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of right ventricular outflow tract obstructions. In one study the odds ratio was 2.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 6.0, 7 exposed infants) and in the other study the odds ratio was 3.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 8.8, 6 exposed infants). </dd>
</dl>
<p>Other studies have found varying results as to whether there was an increased risk of overall, cardiovascular, or specific congenital malformations. A meta-analysis of epidemiological data over a 16-year period (1992 to 2008) on first trimester paroxetine use in pregnancy and congenital malformations included the above-noted studies in addition to others (n = 17 studies that included overall malformations and n = 14 studies that included cardiovascular malformations; n = 20 distinct studies). While subject to limitations, this meta-analysis suggested an increased occurrence of cardiovascular malformations (prevalence odds ratio [POR] 1.5; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.9) and overall malformations (POR 1.2; 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 1.4) with paroxetine use during the first trimester. It was not possible in this meta-analysis to determine the extent to which the observed prevalence of cardiovascular malformations might have contributed to that of overall malformations, nor was it possible to determine whether any specific types of cardiovascular malformations might have contributed to the observed prevalence of all cardiovascular malformations. </p>
<p>If a patient becomes pregnant while taking paroxetine, she should be advised of the potential harm to the fetus. Unless the benefits of paroxetine to the mother justify continuing treatment, consideration should be given to either discontinuing paroxetine therapy or switching to another antidepressant (see PRECAUTIONS: Discontinuation of Treatment With PAXIL<span class="Bold">)</span>. For women who intend to become pregnant or are in their first trimester of pregnancy, paroxetine should only be initiated after consideration of the other available treatment options.</p>

<h3>Animal Findings</h3>
<p class="First">Reproduction studies were performed at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day in rats and 6 mg/kg/day in rabbits administered during organogenesis. These doses are approximately 8 (rat) and 2 (rabbit) times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on an mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. These studies have revealed no evidence of teratogenic effects. However, in rats, there was an increase in pup <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> during the first 4 days of lactation when dosing occurred during the last trimester of gestation and continued throughout lactation. This effect occurred at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day or approximately one‑sixth of the MRHD on an mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. The no‑effect dose for rat pup mortality was not determined. The cause of these <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> is not known. </p>

<h3>Nonteratogenic Effects</h3>
<p class="First">Neonates exposed to PAXIL and other SSRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding.

It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span> (see WARNINGS: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">Serotonin Syndrome</span>). </p>
<p>Infants exposed to SSRIs in pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322024" conceptname="Pulmonary hypertension">pulmonary hypertension</span> of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 – 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. Several recent epidemiologic studies suggest a positive statistical association between SSRI use (including PAXIL) in pregnancy and PPHN. Other studies do not show a significant statistical association. </p>
<p>Physicians should also note the results of a prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4114950" conceptname="Endogenous depression">major depression</span>, who were either on antidepressants or had received antidepressants less than 12 weeks prior to their last menstrual period, and were in remission.

<p>When treating a pregnant woman with PAXIL, the physician should carefully consider both the potential risks of taking an SSRI, along with the established benefits of treating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> with an antidepressant.

<h3>Discontinuation of Treatment With PAXIL</h3>
<p class="First">Recent clinical trials supporting the various approved indications for PAXIL employed a taper‑phase regimen, rather than an abrupt discontinuation of treatment. The taper‑phase regimen used in GAD and PTSD clinical trials involved an incremental decrease in the daily dose by 10 mg/day at weekly intervals. When a daily dose of 20 mg/day was reached, patients were continued on this dose for 1 week before treatment was stopped. </p>
<p>With this regimen in those studies, the following adverse events were reported at an incidence of 2% or greater for PAXIL and were at least twice that reported for placebo: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4304251" conceptname="Bizarre dreams">Abnormal dreams</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4193492" conceptname="Acroparesthesia">paresthesia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>. In the majority of patients, these events were mild to moderate and were self-limiting and did not require medical intervention. </p>
<p>During marketing of PAXIL and other SSRIs and SNRIs, there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon the discontinuation of these drugs (particularly when abrupt), including the following: Dysphoric mood, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4311114" conceptname="Sensory disorder">sensory disturbances</span> (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4193492" conceptname="Acroparesthesia">paresthesias</span> such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4193492" conceptname="Acroparesthesia">electric shock sensations</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377575" conceptname="Tinnitus">tinnitus</span>), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4061577" conceptname="Lethargy">lethargy</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4078201" conceptname="Mood swings">emotional lability</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333678" conceptname="Hypomania">hypomania</span>. While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms. </p>
<p>Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with PAXIL. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</p>

<h3>Tamoxifen</h3>
<p class="First">Some studies have shown that the efficacy of tamoxifen, as measured by the risk of breast cancer relapse/mortality, may be reduced when co-prescribed with paroxetine as a result of paroxetine’s irreversible inhibition of CYP2D6 (see Drug Interactions). However, other studies have failed to demonstrate such a risk. It is uncertain whether the coadministration of paroxetine and tamoxifen has a significant adverse effect on the efficacy of tamoxifen. One study suggests that the risk may increase with longer duration of coadministration. When tamoxifen is used for the treatment or prevention of breast cancer, prescribers should consider using an alternative antidepressant with little or no CYP2D6 inhibition.</p>

<h3>Use in Patients With Concomitant Illness</h3>
<p class="First">Clinical experience with PAXIL in patients with certain concomitant systemic illness is limited. Caution is advisable in using PAXIL in patients with diseases or conditions that could affect metabolism or hemodynamic responses. </p>
<p>As with other SSRIs, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4290615" conceptname="Dilated pupil">mydriasis</span> has been infrequently reported in premarketing studies with PAXIL. A few cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432312" conceptname="Chronic angle-closure glaucoma">acute angle closure glaucoma</span> associated with paroxetine therapy have been reported in the literature. As <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4290615" conceptname="Dilated pupil">mydriasis</span> can cause acute angle closure in patients with narrow angle <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437541" conceptname="Glaucoma">glaucoma</span>, caution should be used when PAXIL is prescribed for patients with narrow angle <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437541" conceptname="Glaucoma">glaucoma</span>.</p>
<p>PAXIL has not been evaluated or used to any appreciable extent in patients with a recent history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> or unstable heart disease. Patients with these diagnoses were excluded from clinical studies during the product’s premarket testing. Evaluation of electrocardiograms of 682 patients who received PAXIL in double‑blind, placebo-controlled trials, however, did not indicate that PAXIL is associated with the development of significant ECG abnormalities. Similarly, PAXIL does not cause any clinically important changes in heart rate or blood pressure.</p>
<p>Increased plasma concentrations of paroxetine occur in patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min.) or severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>.

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">PAXIL should not be chewed or crushed, and should be swallowed whole.</p>
<p>Patients should be cautioned about the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span> with the concomitant use of PAXIL and triptans, tramadol, or other serotonergic agents.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised that taking Paxil can cause mild pupillary dilation, which in susceptible individuals, can lead to an episode of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432312" conceptname="Chronic angle-closure glaucoma">angle closure glaucoma</span>. Pre-existing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437541" conceptname="Glaucoma">glaucoma</span> is almost always open-angle <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437541" conceptname="Glaucoma">glaucoma</span> because <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432312" conceptname="Chronic angle-closure glaucoma">angle closure glaucoma</span>, when diagnosed, can be treated definitively with iridectomy. Open-angle <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437541" conceptname="Glaucoma">glaucoma</span> is not a risk factor for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432312" conceptname="Chronic angle-closure glaucoma">angle closure glaucoma</span>. Patients may wish to be examined to determine whether they are susceptible to angle closure, and have a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118659" conceptname="Prophylactic">prophylactic</span> procedure (e.g., iridectomy), if they are susceptible.</p>
<p>Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with PAXIL and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide is available for PAXIL. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. </p>
<p>Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking PAXIL.</p>

Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient’s prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient’s presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication.</p>

<h3>Tryptophan</h3>
<p class="First">As with other serotonin reuptake inhibitors, an interaction between paroxetine and tryptophan may occur when they are coadministered. Adverse experiences, consisting primarily of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, have been reported when tryptophan was administered to patients taking PAXIL.

<h3>Pimozide</h3>
<p class="First">In a controlled study of healthy volunteers, after PAXIL was titrated to 60 mg daily, co-administration of a single dose of 2 mg pimozide was associated with mean increases in pimozide AUC of 151% and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of 62%, compared to pimozide administered alone. The increase in pimozide AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> is due to the CYP2D6 inhibitory properties of paroxetine. Due to the narrow therapeutic index of pimozide and its known ability to prolong the QT interval, concomitant use of pimozide and PAXIL is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).</p>

<h3>Serotonergic Drugs</h3>
<p class="First">Based on the mechanism of action of SNRIs and SSRIs, including paroxetine hydrochloride, and the potential for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span>, caution is advised when PAXIL is coadministered with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, such as triptans, lithium, fentanyl, tramadol, or St. John’s Wort (see WARNINGS: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">Serotonin Syndrome</span>). </p>
<p>The concomitant use of PAXIL with MAOIs (including linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

<h3>Drugs Affecting Hepatic Metabolism</h3>
<p class="First">The metabolism and pharmacokinetics of paroxetine may be affected by the induction or inhibition of drug‑metabolizing enzymes.</p>

<a name="ID_4bea5ed3-177f-48ba-9bd3-896b624dba57"></a><a name="section-7.4.9"></a><p></p>
<h3>Cimetidine</h3>
<p class="First">Cimetidine inhibits many cytochrome P<span class="Sub">450</span> (oxidative) enzymes. In a study where PAXIL (30 mg once daily) was dosed orally for 4 weeks, steady‑state plasma concentrations of paroxetine were increased by approximately 50% during coadministration with oral cimetidine (300 mg three times daily) for the final week. Therefore, when these drugs are administered concurrently, dosage adjustment of PAXIL after the 20-mg starting dose should be guided by clinical effect. The effect of paroxetine on cimetidine’s pharmacokinetics was not studied.</p>

<h3>Phenobarbital</h3>
<p class="First">Phenobarbital induces many cytochrome P<span class="Sub">450</span> (oxidative) enzymes. When a single oral 30-mg dose of PAXIL was administered at phenobarbital steady state (100 mg once daily for 14 days), paroxetine AUC and T<span class="Sub">½</span> were reduced (by an average of 25% and 38%, respectively) compared to paroxetine administered alone. The effect of paroxetine on phenobarbital pharmacokinetics was not studied. Since PAXIL exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics, the results of this study may not address the case where the 2 drugs are both being chronically dosed. No initial dosage adjustment of PAXIL is considered necessary when coadministered with phenobarbital; any subsequent adjustment should be guided by clinical effect.</p>

<h3>Phenytoin</h3>
<p class="First">When a single oral 30-mg dose of PAXIL was administered at phenytoin steady state (300 mg once daily for 14 days), paroxetine AUC and T½ were reduced (by an average of 50% and 35%, respectively) compared to PAXIL administered alone. In a separate study, when a single oral 300-mg dose of phenytoin was administered at paroxetine steady state (30 mg once daily for 14 days), phenytoin AUC was slightly reduced (12% on average) compared to phenytoin administered alone. Since both drugs exhibit nonlinear pharmacokinetics, the above studies may not address the case where the 2 drugs are both being chronically dosed. No initial dosage adjustments are considered necessary when these drugs are coadministered; any subsequent adjustments should be guided by clinical effect (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Reports).</p>

<h3>Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6</h3>
<p class="First">Many drugs, including most drugs effective in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (paroxetine, other SSRIs and many tricyclics), are metabolized by the cytochrome P<span class="Sub">450</span> isozyme CYP2D6. Like other agents that are metabolized by CYP2D6, paroxetine may significantly inhibit the activity of this isozyme. In most patients (&gt;90%), this CYP2D6 isozyme is saturated early during dosing with PAXIL. In 1 study, daily dosing of PAXIL (20 mg once daily) under steady‑state conditions increased single dose desipramine (100 mg) C<span class="Sub">max</span>, AUC, and T½ by an average of approximately 2‑, 5‑, and 3‑fold, respectively. Concomitant use of paroxetine with risperidone, a CYP2D6 substrate has also been evaluated. In 1 study, daily dosing of paroxetine 20 mg in patients stabilized on risperidone (4 to 8 mg/day) increased mean plasma concentrations of risperidone approximately 4-fold, decreased 9-hydroxyrisperidone concentrations approximately 10%, and increased concentrations of the active moiety (the sum of risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone) approximately 1.4-fold. The effect of paroxetine on the pharmacokinetics of atomoxetine has been evaluated when both drugs were at steady state. In healthy volunteers who were extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6, paroxetine 20 mg daily was given in combination with 20 mg atomoxetine every 12 hours. This resulted in increases in steady state atomoxetine AUC values that were 6- to 8-fold greater and in atomoxetine C<span class="Sub">max</span> values that were 3- to 4-fold greater than when atomoxetine was given alone. Dosage adjustment of atomoxetine may be necessary and it is recommended that atomoxetine be initiated at a reduced dose when it is given with paroxetine.</p>
<p>Concomitant use of PAXIL with other drugs metabolized by cytochrome CYP2D6 has not been formally studied but may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either PAXIL or the other drug.</p>
<p>Therefore, coadministration of PAXIL with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including certain drugs effective in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (e.g., nortriptyline, amitriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, and fluoxetine), phenothiazines, risperidone, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution. </p>
<p>However, due to the risk of serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4132309" conceptname="Sudden death">sudden death</span> potentially associated with elevated plasma levels of thioridazine, paroxetine and thioridazine should not be coadministered (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS).</p>
<p>Tamoxifen is a pro-drug requiring metabolic activation by CYP2D6. Inhibition of CYP2D6 by paroxetine may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of an active metabolite (endoxifen) and hence reduced efficacy of tamoxifen (see PRECAUTIONS).</p>
<p>At steady state, when the CYP2D6 pathway is essentially saturated, paroxetine clearance is governed by alternative P<span class="Sub">450</span> isozymes that, unlike CYP2D6, show no evidence of saturation (see PRECAUTIONS: <span class="Italics">Tricyclic Antidepressants [TCAs]</span>).</p>

<h3>Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome CYP3A4</h3>
<p class="First">An in vivo interaction study involving the coadministration under steady-state conditions of paroxetine and terfenadine, a substrate for cytochrome CYP3A4, revealed no effect of paroxetine on terfenadine pharmacokinetics. In addition, in vitro studies have shown ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity, to be at least 100 times more potent than paroxetine as an inhibitor of the metabolism of several substrates for this enzyme, including terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, triazolam, and cyclosporine. Based on the assumption that the relationship between paroxetine’s in vitro K<span class="Sub">i</span> and its lack of effect on terfenadine’s in vivo clearance predicts its effect on other CYP3A4 substrates, paroxetine’s extent of inhibition of CYP3A4 activity is not likely to be of clinical significance.</p>

<h3>Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)</h3>
<p class="First">Caution is indicated in the coadministration of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) with PAXIL, because paroxetine may inhibit TCA metabolism. Plasma TCA concentrations may need to be monitored, and the dose of TCA may need to be reduced, if a TCA is coadministered with PAXIL (see PRECAUTIONS: <span class="Italics">Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome CYP2D6</span>).</p>

<h3>Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein</h3>
<p class="First">Because paroxetine is highly bound to plasma protein, administration of PAXIL to a patient taking another drug that is highly protein bound may cause increased free concentrations of the other drug, potentially resulting in adverse events. Conversely, adverse effects could result from displacement of paroxetine by other highly bound drugs.</p>

<h3>Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (e.g., NSAIDs, Aspirin, and Warfarin)</h3>
<p class="First">Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">gastrointestinal bleeding</span> have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>. Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, have been reported when SSRIs or SNRIs are coadministered with warfarin.

<h3>Carcinogenesis</h3>
<p class="First">Two‑year carcinogenicity studies were conducted in rodents given paroxetine in the diet at 1, 5, and 25 mg/kg/day (mice) and 1, 5, and 20 mg/kg/day (rats). These doses are up to 2.4 (mouse) and 3.9 (rat) times the MRHD for major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span>, GAD, and PTSD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. Because the MRHD for major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> is slightly less than that for OCD (50 mg versus 60 mg), the doses used in these carcinogenicity studies were only 2.0 (mouse) and 3.2 (rat) times the MRHD for OCD. There was a significantly greater number of male rats in the high‑dose group with reticulum cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084784" conceptname="Sarcoma">sarcomas</span> (1/100, 0/50, 0/50, and 4/50 for control, low-, middle-, and high‑dose groups, respectively) and a significantly increased linear trend across dose groups for the occurrence of lymphoreticular tumors in male rats. Female rats were not affected. Although there was a dose‑related increase in the number of tumors in mice, there was no drug-related increase in the number of mice with tumors. The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown.</p>

<h3>Impairment of Fertility</h3>
<p class="First">Some clinical studies have shown that SSRIs (including paroxetine) may affect sperm quality during SSRI treatment, which may affect fertility in some men.</p>
<p>A reduced pregnancy rate was found in reproduction studies in rats at a dose of paroxetine of 15 mg/kg/day, which is 2.9 times the MRHD for major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span>, GAD, and PTSD or 2.4 times the MRHD for OCD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. Irreversible lesions occurred in the reproductive tract of male rats after dosing in toxicity studies for 2 to 52 weeks. These lesions consisted of vacuolation of epididymal tubular epithelium at 50 mg/kg/day and atrophic changes in the seminiferous tubules of the testes with arrested spermatogenesis at 25 mg/kg/day (9.8 and 4.9 times the MRHD for major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span>, and GAD; 8.2 and 4.1 times the MRHD for OCD and PD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).</p>

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established (see BOX WARNING and WARNINGS: Clinical Worsening and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> Risk). Three placebo-controlled trials in 752 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with PAXIL, and the data were not sufficient to support a claim for use in pediatric patients. Anyone considering the use of PAXIL in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">Decreased appetite</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs. Consequently, regular monitoring of weight and growth should be performed in children and adolescents treated with an SSRI such as PAXIL.</p>
<p>In placebo-controlled clinical trials conducted with pediatric patients, the following adverse events were reported in at least 2% of pediatric patients treated with PAXIL and occurred at a rate at least twice that for pediatric patients receiving placebo: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4078201" conceptname="Mood swings">emotional lability</span> (including self-harm, suicidal thoughts, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4219484" conceptname="Suicide attempt">attempted suicide</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4136768" conceptname="Crying">crying</span>, and mood fluctuations), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4195585" conceptname="Hostile behavior">hostility</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">decreased appetite</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4195305" conceptname="Hyperactive behavior">hyperkinesia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>.</p>
<p>Events reported upon discontinuation of treatment with PAXIL in the pediatric clinical trials that included a taper phase regimen, which occurred in at least 2% of patients who received PAXIL and which occurred at a rate at least twice that of placebo, were: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4078201" conceptname="Mood swings">emotional lability</span> (including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4092095" conceptname="Planning suicide">suicidal ideation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4219484" conceptname="Suicide attempt">suicide attempt</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4078201" conceptname="Mood swings">mood changes</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4158475" conceptname="Crying associated with mood">tearfulness</span>), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436817" conceptname="Feeling nervous">nervousness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal pain</span> (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Discontinuation of Treatment With PAXIL).</p>

<p class="First">SSRIs and SNRIs, including PAXIL, have been associated with cases of clinically significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">hyponatremia</span> in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse event (see PRECAUTIONS: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">Hyponatremia</span>).</p>
<p>In worldwide premarketing clinical trials with PAXIL, 17% of patients treated with PAXIL (approximately 700) were 65 years of age or older. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed a decreased clearance in the elderly, and a lower starting dose is recommended; there were, however, no overall differences in the adverse event profile between elderly and younger patients, and effectiveness was similar in younger and older patients (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</p>

<h2>Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials</h2>
<p class="First">The prescriber should be aware that the figures in the tables following cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side effect incidence rate in the populations studied.</p>

<p class="First">Over a 4‑ to 6‑week period, there was evidence of adaptation to some adverse events with continued therapy (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>), but less to other effects (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226991" conceptname="Aptyalism">dry mouth</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">asthenia</span>).</p>

<h4><span class="Bold">Male and Female <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4237140" conceptname="Abnormal sexual function">Sexual Dysfunction</span> With SSRIs</span></h4>
<p class="First">Although changes in sexual desire, sexual performance, and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder, they may also be a consequence of pharmacologic treatment. In particular, some evidence suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can cause such untoward sexual experiences. </p>
<p>Reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance, and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, however, in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in product labeling, are likely to underestimate their actual incidence.</p>
<p>In placebo‑controlled clinical trials involving more than 3,200 patients, the ranges for the reported incidence of sexual side effects in males and females with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, OCD, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span>, GAD, and PTSD are displayed in Table 6. </p>

<h2>Other Events Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of PAXIL</h2>
<p class="First">During its premarketing assessment in major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, multiple doses of PAXIL were administered to 6,145 patients in phase 2 and 3 studies. The conditions and duration of exposure to PAXIL varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) open and double-blind studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, and fixed-dose, and titration studies. During premarketing clinical trials in OCD, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434613" conceptname="Generalized anxiety disorder">generalized anxiety disorder</span>, and posttraumatic stress disorder, 542, 469, 522, 735, and 676 patients, respectively, received multiple doses of PAXIL. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories.</p>
<p>In the tabulations that follow, reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART‑based Dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 9,089 patients exposed to multiple doses of PAXIL who experienced an event of the type cited on at least 1 occasion while receiving PAXIL. All reported events are included except those already listed in Tables 2 to 5, those reported in terms so general as to be uninformative and those events where a drug cause was remote. It is important to emphasize that although the events reported occurred during treatment with paroxetine, they were not necessarily caused by it.</p>
<p>Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: Frequent adverse events are those occurring on 1 or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo‑controlled trials appear in this listing); infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Events of major clinical importance are also described in the PRECAUTIONS section.</p>

While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency for any drug-seeking behavior, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed. Consequently, patients should be evaluated carefully for history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed closely for signs of misuse or abuse of PAXIL (e.g., development of tolerance, incrementations of dose, drug-seeking behavior).</p>

<h2>Human Experience</h2>
<p class="First">Since the introduction of PAXIL in the United States, 342 spontaneous cases of deliberate or accidental overdosage during paroxetine treatment have been reported worldwide (circa 1999). These include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> with paroxetine alone and in combination with other substances. Of these, 48 cases were fatal and of the fatalities, 17 appeared to involve paroxetine alone. Eight fatal cases that documented the amount of paroxetine ingested were generally confounded by the ingestion of other drugs or alcohol or the presence of significant comorbid conditions. Of 145 non‑fatal cases with known outcome, most recovered without sequelae. The largest known ingestion involved 2,000 mg of paroxetine (33 times the maximum recommended daily dose) in a patient who recovered. </p>

<h2>Overdosage Management</h2>
<p class="First">No specific antidotes for paroxetine are known. Treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any drugs effective in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>.</p>
<p>Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. General supportive and symptomatic measures are also recommended. Induction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> is not recommended. Due to the large volume of distribution of this drug, forced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span>, dialysis, hemoperfusion, or exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. </p>
<p>A specific caution involves patients who are taking or have recently taken paroxetine who might ingest excessive quantities of a tricyclic antidepressant. In such a case, accumulation of the parent tricyclic and/or an active metabolite may increase the possibility of clinically significant sequelae and extend the time needed for close medical observation (see PRECAUTIONS: <span class="Italics">Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome CYP2D6</span>).</p>
<p>In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement. The physician should consider contacting a poison control center for additional information on the treatment of any <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. Telephone numbers for certified poison control centers are listed in the <span class="Italics">Physicians' Desk Reference</span> (PDR).</p>

<h3>Usual Initial Dosage</h3>
<p class="First"> PAXIL should be administered as a single daily dose with or without food, usually in the morning. The recommended initial dose is 20 mg/day. Patients were dosed in a range of 20 to 50 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of PAXIL in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>. As with all drugs effective in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, the full effect may be delayed. Some patients not responding to a 20-mg dose may benefit from dose increases, in 10-mg/day increments, up to a maximum of 50 mg/day. Dose changes should occur at intervals of at least 1 week.</p>

<h3>Maintenance Therapy</h3>
<p class="First">There is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with PAXIL should remain on it. It is generally agreed that acute episodes of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> require several months or longer of sustained pharmacologic therapy. Whether the dose needed to induce remission is identical to the dose needed to maintain and/or sustain euthymia is unknown.</p>
<p>Systematic evaluation of the efficacy of PAXIL has shown that efficacy is maintained for periods of up to 1 year with doses that averaged about 30 mg.</p>

<h3>Usual Initial Dosage</h3>
<p class="First">PAXIL should be administered as a single daily dose with or without food, usually in the morning. The recommended dose of PAXIL in the treatment of OCD is 40 mg daily. Patients should be started on 20 mg/day and the dose can be increased in 10-mg/day increments. Dose changes should occur at intervals of at least 1 week. Patients were dosed in a range of 20 to 60 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of PAXIL in the treatment of OCD. The maximum dosage should not exceed 60 mg/day.</p>

<h3>Maintenance Therapy</h3>
<p class="First">Long‑term maintenance of efficacy was demonstrated in a 6‑month relapse prevention trial. In this trial, patients with OCD assigned to paroxetine demonstrated a lower relapse rate compared to patients on placebo (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Trials). OCD is a chronic condition, and it is reasonable to consider continuation for a responding patient. Dosage adjustments should be made to maintain the patient on the lowest effective dosage, and patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for continued treatment.</p>

<h3>Treatment of Pregnant Women During the Third Trimester</h3>
<p class="First">Neonates exposed to PAXIL and other SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding (see WARNINGS: Usage in Pregnancy). When treating pregnant women with paroxetine during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment.</p>

<h3>Dosage for Elderly or Debilitated Patients, and Patients With Severe Renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic Impairment</span></h3>
<p class="First">The recommended initial dose is 10 mg/day for elderly patients, debilitated patients, and/or patients with severe renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>. Increases may be made if indicated. Dosage should not exceed 40 mg/day.</p>

<h2>Switching a Patient to or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Intended to Treat Psychiatric Disorders</h2>
<p class="First">At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with PAXIL. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping PAXIL before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).</p>

<h2>Use of PAXIL With Other MAOIs, Such as Linezolid or Methylene Blue</h2>
<p class="First">Do not start PAXIL in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue because there is increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span>. In a patient who requires more urgent treatment of a psychiatric condition, other interventions, including hospitalization, should be considered (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). </p>
<p>In some cases, a patient already receiving therapy with PAXIL may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span> in a particular patient, PAXIL should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered. The patient should be monitored for symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span> for 2 weeks or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, whichever comes first. Therapy with PAXIL may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue (see WARNINGS).</p>
<p>The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg/kg with PAXIL is unclear. The clinician should, nevertheless, be aware of the possibility of emergent symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span> with such use (see WARNINGS).</p>

<h2>Discontinuation of Treatment With PAXIL:</h2>
<p class="First">Symptoms associated with discontinuation of PAXIL have been reported (see PRECAUTIONS: <span class="Italics">Discontinuation of Treatment With PAXIL</span>). Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment, regardless of the indication for which PAXIL is being prescribed. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate.</p>
