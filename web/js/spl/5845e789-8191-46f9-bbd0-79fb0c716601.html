<h1><span class="Bold">WARNINGS
</span></h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">1. ESTROGENS HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO INCREASE THE RISK OF ENDOMETRIAL CARCINOMA.</span></p>
<p>Three independent case control studies have reported an increased risk of endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women exposed to exogenous estrogens for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4088438" conceptname="Prolonged periods">prolonged periods</span>.<span class="Sup">1-3</span> This risk was independent of the other known risk factors for endometrial cancer. These studies are further supported by the finding that incidence rates of endometrial cancer have increased sharply since 1969 in eight different areas of the United States with population-based cancer reporting systems, an increase which may be related to the rapidly expanding use of estrogens during the last decade.<span class="Sup">4</span></p>
<p>The three case control studies reported that the risk of endometrial cancer in estrogen users was about 4.5 to 13.9 times greater than in nonusers. The risk appears to depend on both duration of treatment<span class="Sup">1</span> and on estrogen dose.<span class="Sup">4</span> In view of these findings, when estrogens are used for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439082" conceptname="Menopausal syndrome">menopausal symptoms</span>, the lowest dose that will control symptoms should be utilized and medication should be discontinued as soon as possible. When prolonged treatment is medically indicated, the patient should be reassessed on at least a semiannual basis to determine the need for continued therapy. Although the evidence must be considered preliminary, one study suggests that cyclic administration of low doses of estrogen may carry less risk than continuous administration,<span class="Sup">3</span> it therefore appears prudent to utilize such a regimen.</p>
<p>Close clinical surveillance of all women taking estrogens is important. In all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129155" conceptname="Vaginal bleeding">vaginal bleeding</span>, adequate diagnostic measures should be undertaken to rule out malignancy.</p>
<p>There is no evidence at present that â€œnaturalâ€? estrogens are more or less hazardous than â€œsyntheticâ€? estrogens at equiestrogenic doses.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">2. ESTROGENS SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING PREGNANCY.</span></p>
<p>The use of female sex hormones, both estrogens and progestogens, during early pregnancy may seriously damageÂ  the offspring. It has been shown that females exposed in utero to diethylstilbestrol, a non-steriodal estrogen, have an increased risk of developing in later life a form of vaginal or cervical cancer that is ordinarily extremely rare.<span class="Sup">5,6</span> This risk has been estimated as not greater than 4 per 1000 exposures.<span class="Sup">7</span> Furthermore, a high percentage of such exposed women (from 30 to 90 percent) have been found to have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242227" conceptname="Vaginal adenosis">vaginal adenosis</span>,<span class="Sup">8-12</span> epithelial changes of the vagina and cervix. Although these changes are histologically benign, it is not known whether they are precursors of malignancy. Although similar data are not available with the use of other estrogens, it cannot be presumed they would not induce similar changes.</p>
<p>Several reports suggest an association between intrauterine exposure to female sex hormones and congenital anomalies, including congenital heart defects and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="73307" conceptname="Transverse deficiency of lower limb">limb reduction defects</span>.<span class="Sup">13-16</span> One case control study<span class="Sup">16</span> estimated a 4.7 fold increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="73307" conceptname="Transverse deficiency of lower limb">limb reduction defects</span> in infants exposed in utero to sex hormones (oral contraceptives, hormone withdrawal tests for pregnancy, or attempted treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440457" conceptname="Threatened miscarriage">threatened abortion</span>). Some of these exposures were very short and involved only a few days of treatment. The data suggest that the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="73307" conceptname="Transverse deficiency of lower limb">limb reduction defects</span> in exposed fetuses is somewhat less than 1 per 1000.</p>
<p>In the past, female sex hormones have been used during pregnancy in an attempt to treat threatened or habitual abortion. There is considerable evidence that estrogens are ineffective for these indications, and there is no evidence from well controlled studies that progesterones are effective for these uses.</p>
<p>IF ESTERIFIED ESTROGENS AND METHYLTESTOSTERONE TABLETS is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, she should be apprised of the potential risks to the fetus, and the advisability of pregnancy continuation.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">3. CARDIOVASCULAR AND OTHER RISKS.</span></p>
<p>ESTERIFIED ESTROGENS AND METHYLTESTOSTERONE TABLETS do not contain a progestin. ESTERIFIED ESTROGENS AND METHYLTESTOSTERONE TABLETS are an Estrogen/Androgen product. Estrogens with or without progestins should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. The Womenâ€™s Health Initiative (WHI) study reported increased risks of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, invasive breast cancer, pulmonary emboli, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4042396" conceptname="Deep thrombophlebitis">deep vein thrombosis</span> in postmenopausal women during 5 years of treatment with conjugated equine estrogens (CE 0.625 mg) combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA 2.5 mg) relative to placebo (<span class="Bold">See </span><span class="Bold"><a href="#b8723fda-f87c-410b-bcc0-263a7ed96cf5">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span><span class="Bold">, </span><span class="Bold Italics">Clinical Studies</span>). Other doses of conjugated estrogens with medroxyprogesterone and other combinations of estrogens and progestins were not studied in the WHI and, in the absence of comparable data, these risks should be assumed to be similar. Because of these risks, estrogens with or without progestins should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</span></h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Estrogens:</span> Estrogens are important in the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sex characteristics. They promote growth and development of the vagina, uterus, and fallopian tubes, and enlargement of the breasts. Indirectly, they contribute to the shaping of the skeleton, maintenance of tone and elasticity of urogenital structures, changes in the epiphyses of the long bones that allow for the pubertal growth spurt and its termination, growth of axillary and pubic hair, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4083855" conceptname="Abnormal pigment">pigmentation</span> of the nipples and genitals. Decline of estrogenic activity at the end of the menstrual cycle can bring on menstruation, although the cessation of progesterone secretion is the most important factor in the mature ovulatory cycle. However, in the preovulatory or nonovulatory cycle, estrogen is the primary determinant in the onset of menstruation. Estrogens also affect the release of pituitary gonadotropins. The pharmacologic effects of esterified estrogens are similar to those of endogeneous estrogens. They are soluble in water and are well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
<p>In responsive tissues (female genital organs, breasts, hypothalamus, pituitary) estrogens enter the cell and are transported into the nucleus. As a result of estrogen action, specific RNA and protein synthesis occurs.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Estrogen Pharmacokinetics</span></p>
<p>Metabolism and inactivation occur primarily in the liver. Some estrogens are excreted into the bile; however they are reabsorbed from the intestine and returned to the liver through the portal venous system. Water soluble esterified estrogens are strongly acidic and are ionized in body fluids, which favor excretion through the kidneys since tubular reabsorption is minimal.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4233066" conceptname="Androgen level">Androgens</span>:</span> Endogenous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4233066" conceptname="Androgen level">androgens</span> are responsible for the normal growth and development of the male sex organs and for maintenance of secondary sex characteristics. These effects include the growth and maturation of prostate, seminal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443720" conceptname="Blister">vesicles</span>, penis, and scrotum; the development of male hair distribution, such as beard, pubic, chest and axillary hair, laryngeal enlargement, vocal cord thickening, alterations in body musculature, and fat distribution. Drugs in this class also cause retention of nitrogen, sodium, potassium, phosphorus, and decreased urinary excretion of calcium. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4233066" conceptname="Androgen level">Androgens</span> have been reported to increase protein anabolism and decrease protein catabolism. Nitrogen balance is improved only when there is sufficient intake of calories and protein. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4233066" conceptname="Androgen level">Androgens</span> are responsible for the growth spurt of adolescence and for the eventual termination of linear growth centers. In children, exogenous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4233066" conceptname="Androgen level">androgens</span> accelerate linear growth rates, but may cause a disproportionate advancement in bone maturation. Use over long periods may result in fusion of the epiphyseal growth centers and termination of growth process. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4233066" conceptname="Androgen level">Androgens</span> have been reported to stimulate the production of red blood cells by enhancing the production of erythropoietic stimulating factor.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Androgen Pharmacokinetics</span></p>
<p>Testosterone given orally is metabolized by the gut and 44 percent is cleared by the liver in the first pass. Oral doses as high as 400 mg per day are needed to achieve clinically effective blood levels for full replacement therapy. The synthetic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4233066" conceptname="Androgen level">androgens</span> (methyltestosterone and fluoxymesterone) are less extensively metabolized by the liver and have longer half-lives. They are more suitable than testosterone for oral administration.</p>
<p>Testosterone in plasma is 98 percent bound to a specific testosterone-estradiol binding globulin, and about 2 percent is free. Generally, the amount of this sex-hormone binding globulin in the plasma will determine the distribution of testosterone between free and bound forms, and the free testosterone concentration will determine its half-life.</p>
<p>About 90 percent of a dose of testosterone is excreted in the urine as glucuronic and sulfuric acid conjugates of testosterone and its metabolites; about 6 percent of a dose is excreted in the feces, mostly in the unconjugated form. Inactivation of testosterone occurs primarily in the liver. Testosterone is metabolized to various 17-keto steroids through two different pathways. There are considerable variations of the half-life of testosterone as reported in the literature, ranging from 10 to 100 minutes.</p>
<p>In many tissues the activity of testosterone appears to depend on reduction to dihydrotestosterone, which binds to cytosol receptor proteins. The steroid-receptor complex is transported to the nucleus where it initiates transcription events and cellular changes related to androgen action.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold">A. General Precautions.
</span></h3>
<ol class="Arabic">
<li>A complete medical and family history should be taken prior to the initiation of any estrogen therapy. The pretreatment and periodic physical examinations should include special reference to blood pressure, breasts, abdomen, and pelvic organs, and should include a Papanicolaou smear. As a general rule, estrogen should not be prescribed for longer than one year without another physical examination being performed.</li>
<li>Fluid retentionâ€“ Because estrogens may cause some degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4125002" conceptname="Idiopathic fluid retention">fluid retention</span>, conditions which might be influenced by this factor such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">migraine</span>, and cardiac or renal dysfunction, require careful observation.</li>

<li>Oral contraceptives appear to be associated with an increased incidence of mental <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.<span class="Sup">24</span> Although it is not clear whether this is due to the estrogenic or progestogenic component of the contraceptive, patients with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> should be carefully observed.</li>
<li>Preexisting uterine leiomyomata may increase in size during estrogen use.</li>
<li>The pathologist should be advised of estrogen therapy when relevant specimens are submitted.</li>
<li>Patients with a past history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span> during pregnancy have an increased risk of recurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span> while receiving estrogen-containing oral contraceptive therapy. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span> develops in any patient receiving estrogen, the medication should be discontinued while the cause is investigated.</li>
<li>Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4326594" conceptname="Abnormal liver function">impaired liver function</span> and they should be administered with caution in such patients.</li>

<li>Because of the effects of estrogens on epiphyseal closure, they should be used judiciously in young patients in whom bone growth is not complete.</li>
<li>Certain endocrine and liver function tests may be affected by estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. The following similar changes may be expected with larger doses of estrogen:<ol class="LittleAlpha">
<li>Increased sulfobromophthalein retention.</li>
<li>Increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> and factors VII, VIII, IX and X; decreased antithrombin 3: increased norepinephrine-induced platelet aggregability.</li>

<div class="Section">

<h3><span class="Bold">WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT ESTROGENS
</span></h3>
<p class="First">Estrogens are female hormones produced by the ovaries. The ovaries make several different kinds of estrogens. In addition, scientists have been able to make a variety of synthetic estrogens. As far as we know, all these estrogens have similar properties and therefore much the same usefulness, side effects, and risks. This leaflet is intended to help you understand what estrogens are used for, the risks involved in their use, and how to use them as safely as possible.</p>
<p>This leaflet includes the most important information about estrogens, but not all the information. If you want to know more, you can ask your doctor or pharmacist to let you read the package insert prepared for the doctor.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-11.1.2"></a><p></p>
<h3><span class="Bold">USES OF ESTROGEN
</span></h3>
<p class="First">Estrogens are prescribed by doctors for a number of purposes, including:</p>
<ol class="Arabic">
<li>To provide estrogen during a period of adjustment when a womanâ€™s ovaries no longer produce it, in order to prevent certain uncomfortable symptoms of estrogen deficiency. (All women normally stop producing estrogens, generally between the ages of 45 and 55; this is called the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span>).</li>
<li>To prevent symptoms of estrogen deficiency when a womanâ€™s ovaries have been removed surgically before the natural <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span>.</li>
<li>To prevent pregnancy. (Estrogens are given along with a progestogen, another female hormone; these combinations are called oral contraceptives or birth control pills. Patient labeling is available to women taking oral contraceptives and they will not be discussed in this leaflet.)</li>
<li>To treat certain cancers in women and men.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="Bold">THERE IS NO PROPER USE OF ESTROGEN IN A PREGNANT WOMAN.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">ESTROGENS IN THE <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">MENOPAUSE</span></span></p>
<p>In the natural course of their lives, all women eventually experience a decrease in estrogen production. This usually occurs between ages 45 and 55 but may occur earlier or later. Sometimes the ovaries may need to be removed before natural <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span> by an operation, producing a â€œsurgical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span>.â€?</p>
<p>When the amount of estrogen in the blood begins to decrease, many women may develop typical symptoms: Feelings of warmth in the face, neck, and chest or sudden intense episodes of heat and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span> throughout the body (called â€œhot flashesâ€? or â€œhot Flushesâ€?). These symptoms are sometimes very uncomfortable. A few women eventually develop changes in the vagina (called â€œatrophic vaginitisâ€?) which cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090431" conceptname="Discomfort">discomfort</span>, especially during and after intercourse.</p>
<p>Estrogens can be prescribed to treat these symptoms of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span>. It is estimated that considerably more than half of all women undergoing the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span> have only mild symptoms or no symptoms at all and therefore do not need estrogens. Other women may need estrogens for a few months, while their bodies adjust to lower estrogen levels. Sometimes the need will be for periods longer than six months. In an attempt to avoid overstimulation of the uterus (womb), estrogens are usually given cyclically during each month of use, that is three weeks of pills followed by one week without pills.</p>
<p>Sometimes women experience nervous symptoms or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> during <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span>. There is no evidence that estrogens are effective for such symptoms and they should not be used to treat them, although other treatment may be needed.</p>
<p>You may have heard that taking estrogens for long periods (years) after the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span> will keep your skin soft and supple and keep you feeling young. There is no evidence that this is so, however, and such long-term treatment carries important risks.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold">THE DANGERS OF ESTROGENS
</span></h3>
<ol class="Arabic">
<li>
<span class="Bold">Cancer of the uterus.</span> If estrogens are used in the postmenopausal period for more than a year, there is an increased risk of <span class="Bold">endometrial cancer</span> (cancer of the uterus). Women taking estrogens have roughly 5 to 10 times as great a chance of getting this cancer as women who take no estrogens. To put this another way, while a postmenopausal woman not taking estrogens has 1 chance in 1,000 each year of getting cancer of the uterus, a woman taking estrogens has 5 to 10 chances in 1,000 each year. For this reason <span class="Bold">it is important to take estrogens only when you really need them.</span><br>The risk of this cancer is greater the longer estrogens are used and also seems to be greater when larger doses are taken. For this reason, <span class="Bold">it is important to take the lowest dose of estrogen that will control symptoms and to take it only as long as it is needed.</span> If estrogens are needed for longer periods of time, your doctor will want to reevaluate your need for estrogens at least every six months.<br>Women using estrogens should report any irregular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129155" conceptname="Vaginal bleeding">vaginal bleeding</span> to their doctors; such <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> may be of no importance, but it can be an early warning of cancer of the uterus. If you have undiagnosed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129155" conceptname="Vaginal bleeding">vaginal bleeding</span>, you should not use estrogens until a diagnosis is made and you are certain there is no cancer of the uterus.</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">Other possible cancers.</span> Estrogens can cause development of other tumors in animals, such as tumors of the breast, cervix, vagina, or liver, when given for a long time. At present there is no good evidence that women using estrogen in the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span> have an increased risk of such tumors, but there is no way yet to be sure they do not; and one study raises the possibility that use of estrogens in the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span> may increase the risk of breast cancer many years later. This is a further reason to use estrogens only when clearly needed. While you are taking estrogens, it is important that you go to your doctor at least once a year for a physical examination. Also, if members of your family have had breast cancer or if you have breast <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4101098" conceptname="Nodule">nodules</span> or abnormal mammograms (breast x-rays), your doctor may wish to carry outÂ  more frequent examinations of your breasts.</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192353" conceptname="Disorder of gallbladder">Gallbladder disease</span>.</span> Women who use estrogens after <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span> are more likely to develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192353" conceptname="Disorder of gallbladder">gallbladder disease</span> needing surgery as women who do not use estrogens. Birth control pills have a similar effect.</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">Abnormal blood clotting.</span> Oral contraceptives increase the risk of blood clotting in various parts of the body. This can result in a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> (if the clot is is in the brain), a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</span> (clot in a blood vessel of the heart), or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440417" conceptname="Pulmonary embolism">pulmonary embolus</span> (a clot which forms in the legs or pelvis, then breaks off and travels to the lungs). Any of these can be fatal.<br>At this time use of estrogens in the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span> is not known to cause such blood clotting, but this has not been fully studied and there could still prove to be such a risk. It is recommended that if you have had clotting in the legs or lungs or a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> while you were using estrogens or birth control pills, you should not use estrogens (unless they are being used to treat cancer of the breast or prostate). If you have had a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</span> or if you have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321318" conceptname="Angina pectoris">angina pectoris</span>, estrogens should be used with great caution and only if clearly needed (for example, if you have severe symptoms of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span>).<br>The larger doses of estrogen used to prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span> of the breasts after pregnancy have been reported to cause clotting in the legs and lungs.</li>

<h3><span class="Bold">SPECIAL WARNING ABOUT PREGNANCY
</span></h3>
<p class="First">You should not receive estrogen if you are pregnant. If this should occur, there is a greater than usual chance that the developing child will be born with a birth defect, although the possibility remains fairly small. A female child may have an increased risk of developing cancer of the vagina or cervix later in life (in the teens or twenties). Every possible effort should be made to avoid exposure to estrogens during pregnancy. If exposure occurs, see your doctor.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold">OTHER EFFECTS OF ESTROGENS
</span></h3>
<p class="First">In addition to the serious known risks of estrogens described above, estrogens have the following side effects and potential risks:</p>

<span class="Bold">Effects on breasts.</span> Estrogens may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208409" conceptname="Breast tenderness">breast tenderness</span> or enlargement and may cause the breasts to secrete a liquid. These effects are not dangerous.</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">Effects on the uterus.</span> Estrogens may cause benign fibroid tumors of the uterus to get larger.<br>Some women will have menstrual <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> when estrogens are stopped. But if the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> occurs on days you are still taking estrogens you should report this to your doctor.</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">Effect on liver.</span> Women taking oral contraceptives develop on rare occasions a benign tumor of the liver which can rupture and bleed into the abdomen. So far, these tumors have not been reported in women using estrogens in the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span>, but you should report any <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span> or unusual <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4082445" conceptname="Tenderness">tenderness</span> in the abdomen to your doctor immediately.<br>Women with a past history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span> (yellowing of the skin and white parts of the eyes) may get <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span> again during estrogen use. If this occurs, stop taking estrogens and see your doctor.</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">Other effects.</span> Estrogens may cause excess fluid to be retained in the body. This may make some conditions worse, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">migraine</span>, heart disease, or kidney disease.</li>

<h2><span class="Bold">SUMMARY
</span></h2>
<p class="First">Estrogens have important uses, but they have serious risks as well. You must decide, with your doctor, whether the risks are acceptable to you in view of the benefits of the treatment. Except where your doctor has prescribed estrogens for use in special cases of cancer of the breast or prostate, you should not use estrogens if you have cancer of the breast or uterus, are pregnant, have undiagnosed abnormal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129155" conceptname="Vaginal bleeding">vaginal bleeding</span>, or have had a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</span> or angina, or clotting in the legs or lungs in the past while you were taking estrogens.</p>
<p>You can use estrogens as safely as possible by understanding that your doctor will require regular physical examinations while you are taking them and will try to discontinue the drug as soon as possible and use the smallest dose possible. Be alert for signs of trouble including:</p>
