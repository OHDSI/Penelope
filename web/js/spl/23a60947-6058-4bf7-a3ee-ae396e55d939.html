<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<a href="#section-"></a><span class="Bold"><br>Central Nervous System</span><p class="First">Oxycodone is a semisynthetic pure opioid agonist whose principal 
therapeutic action is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>. Other pharmacological effects of oxycodone 
include anxiolysis, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142453" conceptname="Feeling high">euphoria</span> and feelings of relaxation. These effects are 
mediated by receptors (notably μ and κ) in the central nervous system for 
endogenous opioid-like compounds such as endorphins and enkephalins. Oxycodone 
produces <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> through direct activity at respiratory centers 
in the brain stem and depresses the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> reflex by direct effect on the center 
of the medulla.</p>
<p>Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) works by inhibiting the body’s production of 
prostaglandins, including prostaglandins involved in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span>. 
Prostaglandins cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> sensations by stimulating muscle contractions and 
dilating blood vessels throughout the body. In the CNS, aspirin works on the 
hypothalamus heat-regulating center to reduce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, however, other mechanisms 
may be involved.</p>
<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><span class="Bold"><br>Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle</span><p>Oxycodone reduces motility by increasing smooth muscle tone in 
the stomach and duodenum. In the small intestine, digestion of food is delayed 
by decreases in propulsive contractions. Other opioid effects include 
contraction of biliary tract smooth muscle, spasm of the Sphincter of Oddi, 
increased ureteral and bladder sphincter tone, and a reduction in uterine tone. 
</p>
<p>Aspirin can produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168618" conceptname="Injury of gastrointestinal tract">gastrointestinal injury</span> (lesions, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcers</span>) through a 
mechanism that is not yet completely understood, but may involve a reduction in 
eicosanoid synthesis by the gastric mucosa. Decreased production of 
prostaglandins may compromise the defenses of the gastric mucosa and the 
activity of substances involved in tissue repair and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcer</span> healing. </p>
<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><span class="Bold"><br>Cardiovascular System</span><p>Oxycodone may produce a release of histamine and may be 
associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span>, and other symptoms, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span>,

<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><span class="Bold"><br>Platelet Aggregation</span><p>Aspirin affects platelet aggregation by irreversibly inhibiting 
prostaglandin cyclo-oxygenase. This effect lasts for the life of the platelet 
and prevents the formation of the platelet aggregating factor thromboxane A2. 
Nonacetylated salicylates do not inhibit this enzyme and have no effect on 
platelet aggregation. At somewhat higher doses, aspirin reversibly inhibits the 
formation of prostaglandin 12 (prostacyclin), which is an arterial vasodilator 
and inhibits platelet aggregation.</p>
<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><span class="Bold"><br>Pharmacokinetics</span><p>Absorption and Distribution</p>
<p>The mean absolute oral bioavailability of oxycodone in cancer patients was 
reported to be about 87%. Oxycodone has been shown to be 45% bound to human 
plasma proteins <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>. The volume of distribution 
after intravenous administration is 211.9 ±186.6 L. </p>
<p>Aspirin is hydrolyzed primarily to salicylic acid in the gut wall and during 
first-pass metabolism through the liver. Salicylic acid is absorbed rapidly from 
the stomach, but most of the absorption occurs in the proximal small intestine. 
Following absorption, salicylate is distributed to most body tissues and fluids, 
including fetal tissues, breast milk, and the CNS. High concentrations are found 
in the liver and kidneys. Salicylate is variably bound to serum proteins, 
particularly albumin.</p>
<p>Metabolism and Elimination</p>
<p>A high portion of oxycodone is N-dealkylated to noroxycodone during 
first-pass metabolism. Oxymorphone, is formed by the O-demethylation of 
oxycodone. The metabolism of oxycodone to oxymorphone is catalyzed by CYP2D6. 
Free and conjugated noroxycodone, free and conjugated oxycodone, and oxymorphone 
are excreted in human urine following a single oral dose of oxycodone. 
Approximately 8% to 14% of the dose is excreted as free oxycodone over 24 hours 
after administration. Following a single, oral dose of oxycodone, the mean ± SD 
elimination half-life is 3.51 ± 1.43 hours.</p>
<p>The biotransformation of aspirin occurs primarily in the liver by the 
microsomal enzyme system. With a plasma half-life of approximately 15 minutes, 
aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed to salicylate. At low doses, salicylate 
elimination follows first-order kinetics. The plasma half-life of salicylate is 
approximately 2 to 3 hours.</p>
<p>Approximately 10% of aspirin is excreted as unchanged salicylate in the 
urine. The major metabolites excreted in the urine are salicyluric acid (75%), 
salicyl phenolic glucuronide (10%), salicyl acyl glucuronide (5%), and gentisic 
and gentisuric acid (less than 1%) each. Eighty to 100% of a single dose is 
excreted in the urine within 24 to 72 hours.</p>

<li>When ENDODAN tablets are no longer needed, the unused tablets should be 
destroyed by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318566" conceptname="Flushing">flushing</span> down the toilet. 
</li>
<li>Patients should be advised not to adjust the medication dose themselves. 
Instead, they must consult with their prescribing physician. 
</li>
<li>Patients should be advised that ENDODAN tablets may impair mental and/or 
physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks 
(e.g., driving, operating heavy machinery). 
</li>
<li>Patients should not combine ENDODAN tablets with alcohol, opioid analgesics, 
tranquilizers, sedatives, or other CNS depressants unless under the 
recommendation and guidance of a physician. When co-administered with another 
CNS depressant, ENDODAN tablets can cause dangerous additive central nervous 
system or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, which can result in serious injury or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.

<p class="First">Although oxycodone may cross-react with some drug urine tests, no 
available studies were found which determined the duration of detectability of 
oxycodone in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4215138" conceptname="Drug screening test">urine drug screens</span>. However, based on pharmacokinetic data, the 
approximate duration of detectability for a single dose of oxycodone is roughly 
estimated to be one to two days following drug exposure. </p>
<p>Urine testing for opiates may be performed to determine illicit drug use and 
for medical reasons such as evaluation of patients with altered states of 
consciousness or monitoring efficacy of drug rehabilitation efforts. The 
preliminary identification of opiates in urine involves the use of an 
immunoassay screening and thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Gas 
chromatography/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> spectrometry (GC/MS) may be utilized as a third-stage 
identification step in the medical investigational sequence for opiate testing 
after immunoassay and TLC. The identities of 6-keto opiates (e.g., oxycodone) 
can further be differentiated by the analysis of their methoxime-trimethylsilyl

<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><span class="Bold"><br>Treatment</span><p>Primary attention should be given to the reestablishment of 
adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and the 
institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Supportive measures 
(including oxygen, intravenous fluids, and vasopressors) should be employed in 
the management of circulatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4078925" conceptname="Pulmonary edema">pulmonary edema</span> accompanying <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> as 
indicated. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">Cardiac arrest</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span> may require cardiac massage or 
defibrillation. Treatment of acid-base disturbances and electrolyte disorders is 
also important. Because of the concern over salicylate toxicity, acid-base 
status should be followed closely with serial blood gas and serum pH 
determinations.</p>
<p>The opioid antagonist naloxone hydrochloride is a specific antidote against 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> which may result from overdosage or unusual sensitivity 
to opioids including oxycodone. Therefore, an appropriate dose of naloxone 
hydrochloride should be administered (usual initial adult dose 0.4 mg-2 mg) 
preferably by the intravenous route, simultaneously with efforts at respiratory 
resuscitation. Since the duration of action of oxycodone may exceed that of the 
antagonist, the patient should be kept under continued surveillance and repeated 
doses of the antagonist should be administered as needed to maintain adequate 
respiration. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of 
clinically significant respiratory or circulatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> secondary to 
oxycodone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. In patients who are physically dependent on any opioid 
agonist including oxycodone, an abrupt or complete reversal of opioid effects 
may precipitate an acute abstinence syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal 
syndrome produced will depend on the degree of physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> and the dose 
of the antagonist administered. Please see the prescribing information for the 
specific opioid antagonist for details of their proper use.</p>
<p>Gastric emptying and/or lavage may be useful in removing unabsorbed drug. 
This procedure is recommended as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the 
patient has <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomited</span> spontaneously. After lavage and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span>, administration of 
activated charcoal, as a slurry, is beneficial, if less than three hours have 
passed since ingestion. Charcoal adsorption should not be employed prior to 
lavage and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span>.</p>
<p>In severe cases of salicylate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4178904" conceptname="Body temperature above reference range">hyperthermia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436375" conceptname="Hypovolemia">hypovolemia</span> are the 
major immediate threats to life. Children should be sponged with tepid water. 
Replacement fluid should be administered intravenously and augmented with 
correction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidosis</span>. Plasma electrolytes and pH should be monitored to 
promote alkaline <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span> of salicylate if renal function is normal. Infusion of 
glucose may be required to control <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. With more severe acute toxicity 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4006309" conceptname="Respiratory alkalosis">respiratory alkalosis</span> may occur.</p>
<p>Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis can be performed to reduce the body 
content of aspirin. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> or in cases of 
life-threatening salicylate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> dialysis is usually required. Exchange

<p>In case of real or suspected <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, a poison control center should be

<h1>DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></h1>
<p class="First">ENDODAN tablets are a Schedule II controlled substance. Oxycodone 
is a mu-agonist opioid with an abuse liability similar to morphine. Oxycodone, 
like morphine and other opioids used in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, can be abused and is subject 
to criminal diversion.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug addiction</span> is defined as an abnormal, compulsive use, use for non-medical 
purposes of a substance despite physical, psychological, occupational or 
interpersonal difficulties resulting from such use, and continued use despite 
harm or risk of harm. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug addiction</span> is a treatable disease, utilizing a 
multi-disciplinary approach, but relapse is common. Opioid addiction is 
relatively rare in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436096" conceptname="Chronic pain">chronic pain</span> but may be more common in 
individuals who have a past history of alcohol or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4279309" conceptname="Substance abuse">substance abuse</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>. 
Pseudoaddiction refers to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relief seeking behavior of patients whose <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> is 
poorly managed. It is considered an iatrogenic effect of ineffective <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> 
management. The health care provider must assess continuously the psychological 
and clinical condition of a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> patient in order to distinguish addiction from 
pseudoaddiction and thus, be able to treat the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> adequately. </p>
<p>Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> on a prescribed medication does not signify addiction. 
Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> involves the occurrence of a withdrawal syndrome when there 
is sudden reduction or cessation in drug use or if an opiate antagonist is 
administered. Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> can be detected after a few days of opioid 
therapy. However, clinically significant physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> is only seen after 
several weeks of relatively high dosage therapy. In this case, abrupt 
discontinuation of the opioid may result in a withdrawal syndrome. If the 
discontinuation of opioids is therapeutically indicated, gradual tapering of the 
drug over a 2-week period will prevent withdrawal symptoms. The severity of the 
withdrawal syndrome depends primarily on the daily dosage of the opioid, the 
duration of therapy and medical status of the individual. </p>
<p>The withdrawal syndrome of oxycodone is similar to that of morphine. This 
syndrome is characterized by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089239" conceptname="Yawning">yawning</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, increased heart rate and blood

<p>“Drug-seeking? behavior is very common in addicts and drug abusers. 
Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office 
hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated 
“loss? of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide 
prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). 
“Doctor shopping? to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug 
abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction.</p>
<p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> and 
tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by 
concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> in all addicts. In 
addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction and is 
characterized by misuse for non-medical purposes, often in combination with 
other psychoactive substances. Oxycodone, like other opioids, has been diverted 
for non-medical use. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, 
including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised.</p>
<p>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic 
re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate 
measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</p>
<p>Like other opioid medications, ENDODAN tablets are subject to the Federal 
Controlled Substances Act. After chronic use, ENDODAN tablets should not be 
discontinued abruptly when it is thought that the patient has become physically 
dependent on oxycodone.</p>
