<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First"> The pharmacological effect of Metopirone is to reduce cortisol and corticosterone production by inhibiting the 11-beta-hydroxylation reaction in the adrenal cortex. Removal of the strong inhibitory feedback mechanism exerted by cortisol results in an increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production by the pituitary. With continued blockade of the enzymatic steps leading to production of cortisol and corticosterone, there is a marked increase in adrenocortical secretion of their immediate precursors, 11-desoxycortisol and desoxycorticosterone, which are weak suppressors of ACTH release, and a corresponding elevation of these steroids in the plasma and of their metabolites in the urine. These metabolites are readily determined by measuring urinary 17â€‘hydroxycorticosteroids (17-OHCS) or 17-ketogenic steroids (17-KGS). Because of these actions, Metopirone is used as a diagnostic test, with urinary 17-OHCS measured as an index of pituitary ACTH responsiveness. Metopirone may also suppress biosynthesis of aldosterone, resulting in a mild natriuresis.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-3.2"></a><p></p>
<p class="First">The response to Metopirone does not occur immediately. Following oral administration,<br>peak steroid excretion occurs during the subsequent 24-hour period.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-3.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Absorption</h2>
<p class="First">Metopirone is absorbed rapidly and well when administered orally as prescribed. Peak plasma concentrations are usually reached 1 hour after administration. After administration of 750 mg, mean peak plasma concentrations are 3.7 Î¼g/mL, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falling</span> to 0.5 Î¼g/mL 4 hours after administration. Following a single 2000-mg dose, mean peak plasma concentrations of metyrapone in plasma are 7.3 Î¼g/mL.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-3.4"></a><p></p>
<h2>Metabolism</h2>
<p class="First">The major biotransformation is reduction of the ketone to metyrapol, an active alcohol metabolite. Eight hours after a single oral dose, the ratio of metyrapone to metyrapol in the plasma is 1:1.5. Metyrapone and metyrapol are both conjugated with glucuronide.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-3.5"></a><p></p>
<h2>Excretion</h2>
<p class="First">Metyrapone is rapidly eliminated from the plasma. The mean Â± SD terminal elimination halfâ€‘life is 1.9 Â± 0.7 hours. Metyrapol takes about twice as long as metyrapone to be eliminated from the plasma. After administration of 4.5 g metyrapone (750 mg every 4 hours), an average of 5.3% of the dose was excreted in the urine in the form of metyrapone (9.2% free and 90.8% as glucuronide) and 38.5% in the form of metyrapol (8.1% free and 91.9% as glucuronide) within 72 hours after the first dose was given.</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<br><div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-7.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Ability of adrenals to respond to exogenous ACTH should be demonstrated before Metopirone is employed as a test. In the presence of hypoâ€‘ or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142479" conceptname="Hyperthyroidism">hyperthyroidism</span>, response to the Metopirone test may be subnormal.</p>
<p>Since Metopirone may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span> and sedation, patients should exercise caution when driving or operating machinery.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34075-2">
<a name="section-7.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">See INTERPRETATION.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34073-7">
<a name="section-7.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Drugs affecting pituitary or adrenocortical function, including all corticosteroid therapy, must be discontinued prior to and during testing with Metopirone.</p>
<p>The metabolism of Metopirone is accelerated by phenytoin; therefore, results of the test may be inaccurate in patients taking phenytoin within two weeks before. A subnormal response may occur in patients on estrogen therapy.</p>
<p>Metopirone inhibits the glucuronidation of acetaminophen and could possibly potentiate acetaminophen toxicity.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-7.4"></a><p></p>
<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Longâ€‘term carcinogenicity and reproduction studies in animals have not been conducted. Metopirone was not mutagenic with or without metabolic activation in three <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of bacteria.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-7.5"></a><p></p>
<h2>Pregnancy Category C</h2>
<p class="First">A subnormal response to Metopirone may occur in pregnant women. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Metopirone. The Metopirone test was administered to 20 pregnant women in their second and third trimester of pregnancy and evidence was found that the fetal pituitary responded to the enzymatic block. It is not known if Metopirone can affect reproduction capacity. Metopirone should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p>
<p>Animal reproduction studies adequate to evaluate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> and postnatal development have not been conducted with Metopirone.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-7.6"></a><p></p>
<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Metopirone is administered to a nursing woman.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-7.7"></a><p></p>
<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of Metopirone did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<br><div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-10.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Single-Dose Short Test</h2>
<p class="First">This test, usually given on an outpatient basis, determines plasma 11-desoxycortisol and/or ACTH levels after a single dose of Metopirone. The patient is given 30 mg/kg (maximum 3 g Metopirone) at midnight with yogurt or milk. The same dose is recommended in children. The blood sample for the assay is taken early the following morning (7:30-8:00 a.m.). The plasma should be frozen as soon as possible. The patient is then given a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118659" conceptname="Prophylactic">prophylactic</span> dose of 50 mg cortisone acetate.</p>
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-10.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p class="First"> Normal values will depend on the method used to determine ACTH and 11â€‘desoxycortisol levels. An intact ACTH reserve is generally indicated by an increase in plasma ACTH to at least 44 pmol/L (200 ng/L) or by an increase in 11â€‘desoxycortisol to over 0.2 Âµmol/L (70Âµg/L).</p>
<p>Patients with suspected adrenocortical insufficiency should be hospitalized overnight as a precautionary measure.</p>

<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">ACTH Test</span><br>The normal 24-hour urinary excretion of 17-OHCS ranges from 3 to 12 mg. Following continuous intravenous infusion of 50 units ACTH over a period of 8 hours, 17-OHCS excretion increases to 15 to 45 mg per 24 hours.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-10.5"></a><p></p>
<h2>Metopirone</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Normal response</span>: In patients with a normally functioning pituitary, administration of Metopirone is followed by a twoâ€‘ to fourâ€‘fold increase of 17-OHCS excretion or doubling of 17-KGS excretion.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Subnormal response</span>: Subnormal response in patients without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="193984" conceptname="Adrenal hypofunction">adrenal insufficiency</span> is indicative of some degree of impairment of pituitary function, either panhypopituitarism or partial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254542" conceptname="Hypopituitarism">hypopituitarism</span> (limited pituitary reserve).</p>
<p>1. <span class="Italics">Panhypopituitarism</span> is readily diagnosed by the classical clinical and chemical evidences of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4167354" conceptname="Hypogonadism">hypogonadism</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140673" conceptname="Hypothyroidism">hypothyroidism</span>, and hypoadrenocorticism. These patients usually have subnormal basal urinary steroid levels. Depending upon the duration of the disease and degree of adrenal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4028206" conceptname="Atrophy">atrophy</span>, they may fail to respond to exogenous ACTH in the normal manner. Administration of Metopirone is not essential in the diagnosis, but if given, it will not induce an appreciable increase in urinary steroids.</p>
<p>2. <span class="Italics">Partial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254542" conceptname="Hypopituitarism">hypopituitarism</span></span> or limited pituitary reserve is the more difficult diagnosis as these patients do not present the classical signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254542" conceptname="Hypopituitarism">hypopituitarism</span>. Measurements of target organ functions often are normal under basal conditions. The response to exogenous ACTH is usually normal, producing the expected rise of urinary steroids (17-OHCS or 17-KGS).</p>
<p>The response, however, to Metopirone is subnormal; that is, no significant increase in 17â€‘OHCS or 17â€‘KGS excretion occurs.</p>
<p>This failure to respond to metyrapone may be interpreted as evidence of impaired pituitaryâ€‘adrenal reserve. In view of the normal response to exogenous ACTH, the failure to respond to metyrapone is inferred to be related to a defect in the CNSâ€‘pituitary mechanisms which normally regulate ACTH secretions. Presumably the ACTH secreting mechanisms of these individuals are already working at their maximal rates to meet everyday conditions and possess limited â€œreserveâ€? capacities to secrete additional ACTH either in response to stress or to decreased cortisol levels occurring as a result of  metyrapone administration.</p>
<p>Subnormal response in patients with Cushingâ€™s syndrome is suggestive of either autonomous adrenal tumors that suppress the ACTH-releasing capacity of the pituitary  or nonendocrine ACTH-secreting tumors.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Excessive response</span>: An excessive excretion of 17-OHCS or 17-KGS after administration of Metopirone is suggestive of Cushingâ€™s syndrome associated with adrenal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4296894" conceptname="Hyperplasia">hyperplasia</span>. These patients have an elevated excretion of urinary corticosteroids under basal conditions and will often, but not invariably, show a â€œsupernormalâ€? response to ACTH and also to Metopirone, excreting more than 35 mg per 24 hours of either 17-OHCS or 17-KGS.</p>
