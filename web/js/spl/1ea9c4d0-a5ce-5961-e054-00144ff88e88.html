<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Benazepril and benazeprilat inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and in animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex.</p>
<p>Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. Hypertensive patients treated with benazepril alone for up to 52 weeks had elevations of serum potassium of up to 0.2 mEq/L. Similar patients treated with benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide for up to 24 weeks had no consistent changes in their serum potassium (see 
         
 
  <a href="#i4i_precautions_id_f25a258b-2a12-4b1d-b07f-c6f0f52cf81c">PRECAUTIONS</a>).
        

 </p>
<p>Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. In animal studies, benazepril had no inhibitory effect on the vasopressor response to angiotensin II and did not interfere with the hemodynamic effects of the autonomic neurotransmitters acetylcholine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine.</p>
<p>ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>While the mechanism through which benazepril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, benazepril has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with low-renin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>.</p>
<p>Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin, so co-administration of an ACE inhibitor tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.</p>
<p>The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</h2>
<p class="First">Following oral administration of benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide, peak plasma concentrations of benazepril are reached within 0.5 to 1 hours. As determined by urinary recovery, the extent of absorption is at least 37%. In fasting subjects, the rate and extent of absorption of benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide from benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide are not different, respectively, from the rate and extent of absorption of benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide from immediate-release monotherapy formulations.</p>
<p>The estimated absolute bioavailability of hydrochlorothiazide after oral administration is about 70%. Peak plasma hydrochlorothiazide concentrations (C
         
 
  <span class="Sub">max</span>) are reached within 2 to 5 hours after oral administration. Hydrochlorothiazide binds to albumin (40% to 70%) and distributes into erythrocytes. 
        

 </p>
<p>The absorption of benazepril from benazepril hydrochloride tablets is not influenced by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract. There is no clinically significant effect of food on the bioavailability of hydrochlorothiazide. </p>
<p>Cleavage of the ester group (primarily in the liver) converts benazepril to its active metabolite, benazeprilat. Peak plasma concentrations of benazeprilat are reached 1 to 2 hours after drug intake in the fasting state and 2 to 4 hours after drug intake in the nonfasting state. The serum protein binding of benazepril is about 96.7% and that of benazeprilat about 95.3%, as measured by equilibrium dialysis; on the basis of 
         
 
  <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>studies, the degree of protein binding should be unaffected by age, hepatic dysfunction, or - over the concentration range of 0.24 mcmol/L to 23.6 mcmol/L - concentration. 
        

 </p>
<p>In studies of rats given 
         
 
  <span class="Sup">14</span>C-benazepril, benazepril and its metabolites crossed the blood-brain barrier only to an extremely low extent. Multiple doses of benazepril did not result in accumulation in any tissue except the lung, where, as with other ACE inhibitors in similar studies, there was a slight increase in concentration due to slow elimination in that organ.
        

 </p>
<p>Benazepril is almost completely metabolized to benazeprilat, which has much greater ACE inhibitory activity than benazepril, and to the glucuronide conjugates of benazepril and benazeprilat. Only trace amounts of an administered dose of benazepril can be recovered unchanged in the urine; about 20% of the dose is excreted as benazeprilat, 4% as benazepril glucuronide, and 8% as benazeprilat glucuronide.</p>
<p>In patients with hepatic dysfunction due to cirrhosis, levels of benazeprilat are essentially unaltered. Similarly, the pharmacokinetics of benazepril and benazeprilat do not appear to be influenced by age.</p>
<p>The kinetics of benazepril are dose-proportional within the dosage range of 5 mg to 20 mg. Small deviations from dose-proportionality were observed when the broader range of 2 mg to 80 mg was studied, possibly due to the saturable binding of the compound to ACE.</p>
<p>The effective half-life of accumulation of benazeprilat following multiple dosing of benazepril is 10 to 11 hours. Thus, steady-state concentrations of benazeprilat should be reached after 2 or 3 doses of benazepril given once daily.</p>
<p>During chronic administration (28 days) of once-daily doses of benazepril between 5 mg and 20 mg, the kinetics did not change, and there was no significant accumulation. Accumulation ratios based on AUC and urinary recovery of benazeprilat were 1.19 and 1.27, respectively.</p>
<p>When dialysis was started 2 hours after ingestion of 10 mg of benazepril, approximately 6% of benazeprilat was removed in 4 hours of dialysis. The parent compound, benazepril, was not detected in the dialysate.</p>
<p>Benazepril and benazeprilat are cleared predominantly by renal excretion in healthy subjects with normal renal function. Nonrenal (i.e., biliary) excretion accounts for approximately 11% to 12% of benazeprilat excretion in healthy subjects. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span>, biliary clearance may compensate to an extent for deficient renal clearance.</p>
<p>The disposition of benazepril and benazeprilat in patients with mild-to-moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> (creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/min) is similar to that in patients with normal renal function. In patients with creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min, peak benazeprilat levels and the initial (alpha phase) half-life increase, and time to steady state may be delayed (see 
         
 
  <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_82d37232-6fb7-4ff0-b7af-5e459a2d3e87">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).
        

 </p>
<p>Following oral administration, plasma hydrochlorothiazide concentrations decline biexponentially, with a mean distribution half-life of about 2 hours and an elimination half-life of about 10 hours. About 70% of an orally administered dose of hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated in the urine as unchanged drug. In a study in individuals with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>, the mean elimination half-life of hydrochlorothiazide was increased to 2 fold in individuals with mild/moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (30 &lt; CLcr &lt; 90 mL/min) and 3 fold and severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (≤ 30 mL/min), when compared to individuals with normal renal function (CLcr &gt; 90 mL/min).</p>

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First">In single-dose studies, benazepril <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314171" conceptname="Low blood pressure reading">lowered blood pressure</span> within 1 hour, with peak reductions achieved 2 to 4 hours after dosing. The antihypertensive effect of a single dose persisted for 24 hours. In multiple-dose studies, once-daily doses of 20 mg to 80 mg decreased seated pressure (systolic/diastolic) 24 hours after dosing by about 6-12/4-7 mmHg. The reductions at trough are about 50% of those seen at peak.</p>
<p>Four dose-response studies of benazepril monotherapy using once-daily dosing were conducted in 470 mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients not using diuretics. The minimal effective once-daily dose of benazepril was 10 mg; further <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falls</span> in blood pressure, especially at morning trough, were seen with higher doses in the studied dosing range (10 mg to 80 mg). In studies comparing the same daily dose of benazepril given as a single morning dose or as a twice-daily dose, blood pressure reductions at the time of morning trough blood levels were greater with the divided regimen.</p>
<p>The antihypertensive effects of benazepril were not appreciably different in patients receiving high- or low-sodium diets.</p>

<h2>Benazepril-Hydrochlorothiazide</h2>
<p class="First">In 15 controlled clinical trials, 1,453 healthy or hypertensive patients were exposed to benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide of which 459 were exposed for at least 6 months, 214 for at least 12 months and 25 for at least 24 months. </p>
<p>The combination of benazepril-hydrochlorothiazide resulted in mean placebo-adjusted decreases in sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures of 10/6 mm Hg with 5-6.25 mg and 10-12.5 mg doses, and 20/10 mm Hg with 20-25 mg dose.</p>
<p>In clinical trials of 
         
 
  <span class="Bold">benazepril/hydrochlorothiazide</span> using benazepril doses of 5 mg to 20 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 mg to 25 mg, the antihypertensive effects were sustained for at least 24 hours, and they increased with increasing dose of either component. Although benazepril monotherapy is somewhat less effective in blacks than in nonblacks, the efficacy of combination therapy appears to be independent of race.

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span></h2>
<p class="First">Benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide can cause symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>. Like other ACE inhibitors, benazepril has been only rarely associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> in uncomplicated hypertensive patients. Symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume and/or salt depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>. Volume and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">salt depletion</span> should be corrected before initiating therapy with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide.</p>
<p>Benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide should be used cautiously in patients receiving concomitant therapy with other antihypertensives. The thiazide component of benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide may potentiate the action of other antihypertensive drugs, especially ganglionic or peripheral adrenergic-blocking drugs. The antihypertensive effects of the thiazide component may also be enhanced in the postsympathectomy patient.</p>

In such patients, benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide therapy should be started under close medical supervision; they should be followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of benazepril or diuretic is increased.</p>
<p>If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, and, if necessary, treated with intravenous infusion of physiological saline.

<h3>Pregnancy Category D</h3>
<p class="First">Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. Resulting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations.

When pregnancy is detected, discontinue benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus.</p>
<p>In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> is observed, discontinue benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide unless it is considered life-saving for the mother.

<h3>NSAIDs and Cox-2 Selective Agents</h3>
<p class="First">In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including benazepril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span>.

<h3>Benazepril</h3>
<p class="First">Benazepril has been used concomitantly with beta-adrenergic-blocking agents, calcium-blocking agents, cimetidine, diuretics, digoxin, hydralazine, and naproxen without evidence of clinically important adverse interactions. Other ACE inhibitors have had less than additive effects with beta-adrenergic blockers, presumably because drugs of both classes lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system. </p>
<p>Interaction studies with warfarin and acenocoumarol have failed to identify any clinically important effects of benazepril on the serum concentrations or clinical effects of these anticoagulants.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenicity, Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">No evidence of carcinogenicity was found when benazepril was given to rats and mice for 104 weeks at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day. On a body-surface-area basis, this dose is 18 times (rats) and 9 times (mice) the maximum recommended human dose. No mutagenic activity was detected in the Ames test in bacteria (with or without metabolic activation), in an in vitro test for forward mutations in cultured mammalian cells, or in a nucleus anomaly test. At doses of 50 mg/kg/day to 500 mg/kg/day (6 to 61 times the maximum recommended dose on a body-surface-area basis), benazepril had no adverse effect on the reproductive performance of male and female rats. </p>
<p>Under the auspices of the National Toxicology Program, rats and mice received 
         
 
  <span class="Bold">hydrochlorothiazide</span> in their feed for two years, at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in mice and up to 100 mg/kg/day in rats. These studies uncovered no evidence of a carcinogenic potential of hydrochlorothiazide in rats or female mice, but there was equivocal evidence of hepatocarcinogenicity in male mice. Hydrochlorothiazide was not genotoxic in in vitro assays using <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, TA 1537, and TA 1538 of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span> typhimurium (the Ames test); in the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) test for chromosomal aberrations; or in in vivo assays using mouse germinal cell chromosomes, Chinese hamster bone marrow chromosomes, and the Drosophila sex-linked recessive lethal trait gene.

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Minimal amounts of unchanged benazepril and benazeprilat are excreted into the breast milk of lactating women treated with benazepril, so that a newborn child ingesting nothing but breast milk would receive less than 0.1% of the maternal doses of benazepril and benazeprilat. Thiazides, on the other hand, are definitely excreted into breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from hydrochlorothiazide and the unknown effects of benazepril in infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide; treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Therapy with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide should be discontinued, and the patient should be observed. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435796" conceptname="Dehydration">Dehydration</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022093" conceptname="Electrolyte imbalance">electrolyte imbalance</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> should be treated by established procedures.</p>
<p>Single oral doses of 1 g/kg of benazepril caused reduced activity in mice, and doses of 3 g/kg were associated with significant lethality. Reduction of activity in rats was not seen until they had received doses of 5 g/kg, and doses of 6 g/kg were not lethal. In single-dose studies of hydrochlorothiazide, most rats survived doses up to 2.75 g/kg. </p>
<p>Data from human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> of benazepril are scanty, but the most common manifestation of human benazepril overdosage is likely to be <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>.

<p>Laboratory determinations of serum levels of benazepril and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of benazepril <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>.</p>
<p>No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of benazepril and its metabolites. Benazeprilat is only slightly dialyzable, but dialysis might be considered in overdosed patients with severely <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> (see

 </p>
<p>Angiotensin II could presumably serve as a specific antagonist-antidote in the setting of benazepril <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, but angiotensin II is essentially unavailable outside of scattered research facilities. Because the hypotensive effect of benazepril is achieved through vasodilation and effective <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436375" conceptname="Hypovolemia">hypovolemia</span>, it is reasonable to treat benazepril <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> by infusion of normal saline solution.</p>

<h2>Switch Therapy</h2>
<p class="First">A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with benazepril alone or with hydrochlorothiazide alone may be switched to combination therapy with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. The usual recommended starting dose is 10 mg/12.5 mg once daily to control blood pressure.</p>
