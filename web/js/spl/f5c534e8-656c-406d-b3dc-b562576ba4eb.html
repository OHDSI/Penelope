<h1> DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">ACTOPLUS MET<span class="Sup">®</span> (pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride) tablets contain two oral antihyperglycemic drugs used in the management of type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>: pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride.  The concomitant use of pioglitazone and metformin has been previously approved based on clinical trials in patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> inadequately controlled on metformin.  Additional efficacy and safety information about pioglitazone and metformin monotherapies may be found in the prescribing information for each individual drug.  </p>
<p> Pioglitazone hydrochloride is an oral antihyperglycemic agent that acts primarily by decreasing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168924" conceptname="Drug resistance to insulin">insulin resistance</span>.  Pioglitazone is used in the management of type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>.  Pharmacological studies indicate that pioglitazone improves sensitivity to insulin in muscle and adipose tissue and inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis.  Pioglitazone improves glycemic control while reducing circulating insulin levels.</p>
<p> Pioglitazone [(±)-5-[[4-[2-(5-ethyl-2-pyridinyl)ethoxy]phenyl]methyl]-2,4-] thiazolidinedione monohydrochloride belongs to a different chemical class and has a different pharmacological action than the sulfonylureas, biguanides, or the α-glucosidase inhibitors.  The molecule contains one asymmetric center, and the synthetic compound is a racemate.  The two enantiomers of pioglitazone interconvert <span class="Italics">in vivo</span>.  The structural formula is as shown: </p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-2.1.1"></a><p></p>
<h3><span class="Italics"> ACTOPLUS MET</span></h3>
<p class="First">ACTOPLUS MET combines two antihyperglycemic agents with different mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>: pioglitazone hydrochloride, a member of the thiazolidinedione class, and metformin hydrochloride, a member of the biguanide class.  Thiazolidinediones are insulin-sensitizing agents that act primarily by enhancing peripheral glucose utilization, whereas biguanides act primarily by decreasing endogenous hepatic glucose production.  </p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-2.1.1.1"></a><p></p>
<h4> Pioglitazone hydrochloride</h4>
<p class="First">Pioglitazone depends on the presence of insulin for its mechanism of action.  Pioglitazone decreases <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168924" conceptname="Drug resistance to insulin">insulin resistance</span> in the periphery and in the liver resulting in increased insulin-dependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output.  Unlike sulfonylureas, pioglitazone is not an insulin secretagogue.  Pioglitazone is a potent and highly selective agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ).  PPAR receptors are found in tissues important for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver.  Activation of PPARγ nuclear receptors modulates the transcription of a number of insulin responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism.</p>
<p>In animal models of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, pioglitazone reduces the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4307509" conceptname="Hyperinsulinism">hyperinsulinemia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440360" conceptname="Pure hyperglyceridemia">hypertriglyceridemia</span> characteristic of insulin-resistant states such as type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>.  The metabolic changes produced by pioglitazone result in increased responsiveness of insulin-dependent tissues and are observed in numerous animal models of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168924" conceptname="Drug resistance to insulin">insulin resistance</span>.</p>
<p>Since pioglitazone enhances the effects of circulating insulin (by decreasing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168924" conceptname="Drug resistance to insulin">insulin resistance</span>), it does not lower blood glucose in animal models that lack endogenous insulin.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-2.1.1.2"></a><p></p>
<h4> Metformin hydrochloride</h4>
<p class="First">Metformin hydrochloride improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin does not produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> in either patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> or normal subjects (except in special circumstances, see <span class="Bold"><a href="#PGMH">PRECAUTIONS, General: </a></span><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"><a href="#PGMH">Metformin hydrochloride</a></span></span>) and does not cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4307509" conceptname="Hyperinsulinism">hyperinsulinemia</span>. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may actually decrease.  </p>

<p>Administration of ACTOPLUS MET 15 mg/850 mg with food resulted in no change in overall exposure of pioglitazone.  With metformin there was no change in AUC; however mean peak serum concentration of metformin was decreased by 28% when administered with food. A delayed time to peak serum concentration was observed for both components (1.9 hours for pioglitazone and 0.8 hours for metformin) under fed conditions.  These changes are not likely to be clinically significant.  </p>

<h4><span class="Italics"> Pioglitazone hydrochloride</span></h4>
<p class="First">Following oral administration, in the fasting state, pioglitazone is first measurable in serum within 30 minutes, with peak concentrations observed within 2 hours.  Food slightly delays the time to peak serum concentration to 3 to 4 hours, but does not alter the extent of absorption.</p>

<h4><span class="Italics"> Metformin hydrochloride</span></h4>
<p class="First">The absolute bioavailability of a 500 mg metformin tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50% - 60%. Studies using single oral doses of metformin tablets of 500 mg to 1500 mg, and 850 mg to 2550 mg, indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination.  Food decreases the extent of and slightly delays the absorption of metformin, as shown by approximately a 40% lower mean peak plasma concentration, a 25% lower AUC in plasma concentration versus time curve, and a 35 minute prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration following administration of a single 850 mg tablet of metformin with food, compared to the same tablet strength administered fasting. The clinical relevance of these decreases is unknown. </p>

<h4> Pioglitazone hydrochloride</h4>
<p class="First">The mean apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of pioglitazone following single-dose administration is 0.63  ±  0.41 (mean ± SD) L/kg of body weight.  Pioglitazone is extensively protein bound (&gt; 99%) in human serum, principally to serum albumin.  Pioglitazone also binds to other serum proteins, but with lower affinity. Metabolites M-III and M-IV also are extensively bound (&gt; 98%) to serum albumin.</p>

Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin, steady-state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24 - 48 hours and are generally &lt;1 µg/mL. During controlled clinical trials, maximum metformin plasma levels did not exceed 5 µg/mL, even at maximum doses. </p>

<h4> Pioglitazone hydrochloride</h4>
<p class="First">Pioglitazone is extensively metabolized by hydroxylation and oxidation; the metabolites also partly convert to glucuronide or sulfate conjugates.  Metabolites M-II and M-IV (hydroxy derivatives of pioglitazone) and M-III (keto derivative of pioglitazone) are pharmacologically active in animal models of type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>.  In addition to pioglitazone, M-III and M-IV are the principal drug-related species found in human serum following multiple dosing.  At steady-state, in both healthy volunteers and in patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, pioglitazone comprises approximately 30% to 50% of the total peak serum concentrations and 20% to 25% of the total AUC.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> data demonstrate that multiple CYP isoforms are involved in the metabolism of pioglitazone.  The cytochrome P450 isoforms involved are CYP2C8 and, to a lesser degree, CYP3A4 with additional contributions from a variety of other isoforms including the mainly extrahepatic CYP1A1.  <span class="Italics">In vivo</span> studies of pioglitazone in combination with P450 inhibitors and substrates have been performed (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#PDIPH">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions, </a></span><span class="Italics"><a href="#PDIPH">Pioglitazone hydrochloride</a></span>).  Urinary 6β-hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratios measured in patients treated with pioglitazone showed that pioglitazone is not a strong CYP3A4 enzyme inducer.</p>
<p>Following oral administration, approximately 15% to 30% of the pioglitazone dose is recovered in the urine.  Renal elimination of pioglitazone is negligible and the drug is excreted primarily as metabolites and their conjugates.  It is presumed that most of the oral dose is excreted into the bile either unchanged or as metabolites and eliminated in the feces. </p>
<p>The mean serum half-life of pioglitazone and total pioglitazone ranges from 3 to 7 hours and 16 to 24 hours, respectively.  Pioglitazone has an apparent clearance, CL/F, calculated to be 5 to 7 L/hr.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-2.2.3.2"></a><p></p>
<h4> Metformin hydrochloride</h4>
<p class="First">Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion. Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> may be a compartment of distribution. </p>

<h3><span class="Italics"> Pioglitazone hydrochloride</span></h3>
<p class="First">Clinical studies demonstrate that pioglitazone improves insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant patients.  Pioglitazone enhances cellular responsiveness to insulin, increases insulin-dependent glucose disposal, improves hepatic sensitivity to insulin, and improves dysfunctional glucose homeostasis.  In patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, the decreased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168924" conceptname="Drug resistance to insulin">insulin resistance</span> produced by pioglitazone results in lower plasma glucose concentrations, lower plasma insulin levels, and lower A1C values.  Based on results from an open-label extension study, the glucose-lowering effects of pioglitazone appear to persist for at least one year.  In controlled clinical studies, pioglitazone in combination with metformin had an additive effect on glycemic control.</p>
<p></p>
<p> Patients with lipid abnormalities were included in placebo-controlled monotherapy clinical studies with pioglitazone.  Overall, patients treated with pioglitazone had mean decreases in triglycerides, mean increases in HDL <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>, and no consistent mean changes in LDL <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> and total <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> compared to the placebo group.  A similar pattern of results was seen in 16-week and 24-week combination therapy studies of pioglitazone with metformin. </p>

<h2> Clinical Studies </h2>
<p class="First">There have been no clinical efficacy studies conducted with ACTOPLUS MET.  However, the efficacy and safety of the separate components have been previously established and the co-administration of the separate components has been evaluated for efficacy and safety in two clinical studies.  These clinical studies established an added benefit of pioglitazone in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> while on metformin therapy.  Bioequivalence of ACTOPLUS MET with co-administered pioglitazone and metformin tablets was demonstrated for both ACTOPLUS MET strengths (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#CPPDM">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism</a></span>).</p>

<h2> Clinical Trials of Pioglitazone Add-on Therapy in Patients Not Adequately Controlled on Metformin   </h2>
<p class="First">Two treatment-randomized, controlled clinical studies in patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pioglitazone plus metformin.  Both studies included patients receiving metformin, either alone or in combination with another antihyperglycemic agent, who had inadequate glycemic control. All other antihyperglycemic agents were discontinued prior to starting study treatment. In the first study, 328 patients received either 30 mg of pioglitazone or placebo once daily for 16 weeks in addition to their established metformin regimen. In the second study, 827 patients received either 30 mg or 45 mg of pioglitazone once daily for 24 weeks in addition to their established metformin regimen.</p>
<p>In the first study, the addition of pioglitazone 30 mg once daily to metformin treatment significantly reduced the mean A1C by 0.83% and the mean FPG by 37.7 mg/dL at Week 16 from that observed with metformin alone. In the second study, the mean reductions from Baseline at Week 24 in A1C were 0.80% and 1.01% for the 30 mg and 45 mg doses, respectively.  Mean reductions from Baseline in FPG were 38.2 mg/dL and 50.7 mg/dL, respectively.  Based on these reductions in A1C and FPG (<span class="Bold">Table 2</span>), the addition of pioglitazone to metformin resulted in significant improvements in glycemic control irrespective of the metformin dose.</p>

When metformin is implicated as the cause of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span>, metformin plasma levels &gt; 5 µg/mL are generally found. </span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">The reported incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span> in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span>. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>, including both intrinsic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span> and renal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4131044" conceptname="Hypoperfusion">hypoperfusion</span>, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span> requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span> who are at risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4131044" conceptname="Hypoperfusion">hypoperfusion</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437390" conceptname="Hypoxemia">hypoxemia</span>, are at increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span>. The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span> increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span> may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥ 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span>. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437390" conceptname="Hypoxemia">hypoxemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435796" conceptname="Dehydration">dehydration</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="132797" conceptname="Sepsis">sepsis</span>. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span>. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see <a href="#PGMH">PRECAUTIONS, General: </a></span><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"><a href="#PGMH">Metformin hydrochloride</a></span></span><span class="Bold">). </span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">The onset of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span> often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4272240" conceptname="Malaise">malaise</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442752" conceptname="Muscle pain">myalgias</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4158346" conceptname="Respiratory distress">respiratory distress</span>, increasing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, and nonspecific <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4183041" conceptname="Abdominal discomfort">abdominal distress</span>.

Metformin should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4017413" conceptname="Acetoacetate">ketones</span>, blood glucose, and, if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302537" conceptname="Digestive system finding">gastrointestinal symptoms</span>, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related.

<p><span class="Bold">Levels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span> and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433736" conceptname="Obesity">obesity</span>, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling (see <a href="#PGMH">PRECAUTIONS, General: </a></span><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"><a href="#PGMH">Metformin hydrochloride</a></span></span><span class="Bold">). </span></p>

If these signs and symptoms develop, the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> should be managed according to current standards of care.  Furthermore, discontinuation or dose reduction of pioglitazone must be considered.  Patients with NYHA Class III and IV cardiac status were not studied during pre-approval clinical trials and pioglitazone is not recommended in these patients (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#boxed-warning">BOXED WARNING</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#C">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span>).</p>
<p> In one 16-week U.S. double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 566 patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, pioglitazone at doses of 15 mg and 30 mg in combination with insulin was compared to insulin therapy alone.  This trial included patients with long-standing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> and a high prevalence of pre-existing medical conditions as follows: arterial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> (57.2%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197608" conceptname="Peripheral neuritis in pregnancy">peripheral neuropathy</span> (22.6%), coronary heart disease (19.6%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="376103" conceptname="Retinopathy">retinopathy</span> (13.1%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> (8.8%), vascular disease (6.4%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321318" conceptname="Angina pectoris">angina pectoris</span> (4.4%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> and/or transient ischemic attack (4.1%), and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span> (2.3%).</p>

<p><span class="Underline">Ovulation</span>:  Therapy with pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, may result in ovulation in some premenopausal anovulatory women.  Thus, adequate contraception in premenopausal women should be recommended while taking ACTOPLUS MET.  This possible effect has not been investigated in clinical studies so the frequency of this occurrence is not known.  </p>
<p><span class="Underline">Hematologic</span>: Across all clinical studies with pioglitazone, mean hemoglobin values declined by 2% to 4% in patients treated with pioglitazone.  These changes primarily occurred within the first 4 to 12 weeks of therapy and remained relatively constant thereafter.  These changes may be related to increased plasma volume and have rarely been associated with any significant hematologic clinical effects (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ARLA">ADVERSE REACTIONS, Laboratory Abnormalities</a></span>).  ACTOPLUS MET may cause decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit.  </p>
<p><span class="Underline">Hepatic Effects</span>: In pre-approval clinical studies worldwide, over 4500 subjects were treated with pioglitazone.  In  U.S. clinical studies, over 4700 patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> received pioglitazone.  There was no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity or elevation of ALT levels in the clinical studies.</p>
<p>During pre-approval placebo-controlled clinical trials in the  U.S., a total of 4 of 1526 (0.26%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 2 of 793 (0.25%) placebo-treated patients had ALT values ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal.  The ALT elevations in patients treated with pioglitazone were reversible and were not clearly related to therapy with pioglitazone.</p>
<p>In postmarketing experience with pioglitazone, reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> and of hepatic enzyme elevations to 3 or more times the upper limit of normal have been received.  Very rarely, these reports have involved <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic failure</span> with and without fatal outcome, although causality has not been established.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pending the availability of the results of additional large, long-term controlled clinical trials and additional postmarketing safety data on pioglitazone, it is recommended that patients treated with ACTOPLUS MET undergo periodic monitoring of liver enzymes. </p>
<p>Serum ALT (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4211515" conceptname="Alanine aminotransferase">alanine aminotransferase</span>) levels should be evaluated prior to the initiation of therapy with ACTOPLUS MET in all patients and periodically thereafter per the clinical judgment of the health care professional.  Liver function tests should also be obtained for patients if symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction occur, e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">anorexia</span>, or dark urine.  The decision whether to continue the patient on therapy with ACTOPLUS MET should be guided by clinical judgment pending laboratory evaluations.  If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137977" conceptname="Jaundice">jaundice</span> is observed, drug therapy should be discontinued.</p>
<p>Therapy with ACTOPLUS MET should not be initiated if the patient exhibits clinical evidence of active liver disease or the ALT levels exceed 2.5 times the upper limit of normal.  Patients with mildly elevated liver enzymes (ALT levels at 1 to 2.5 times the upper limit of normal) at baseline or any time during therapy with ACTOPLUS MET should be evaluated to determine the cause of the liver enzyme elevation.  Initiation or continuation of therapy with ACTOPLUS MET in patients with mildly elevated liver enzymes should proceed with caution and include appropriate clinical follow-up which may include more frequent liver enzyme monitoring.  If serum transaminase levels are increased (ALT &gt; 2.5 times the upper limit of normal), liver function tests should be evaluated more frequently until the levels return to normal or pretreatment values.  If ALT levels exceed 3 times the upper limit of normal, the test should be repeated as soon as possible.  If ALT levels remain &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal or if the patient is jaundiced, ACTOPLUS MET therapy should be discontinued.</p>

<h2> General: <span class="Bold Italics"> Metformin hydrochloride</span>
</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Underline">Monitoring of renal function</span>: Metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of metformin accumulation and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span> increases with the degree of impairment of renal function. Thus, patients with serum creatinine levels above the upper limit of normal for their age should not receive ACTOPLUS MET.  In patients with advanced age, ACTOPLUS MET should be carefully titrated to establish the minimum dose for adequate glycemic effect, because aging is associated with reduced renal function. In elderly patients, particularly those ≥ 80 years of age, renal function should be monitored regularly and, generally, ACTOPLUS MET should not be titrated to the maximum dose of the metformin component (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#WMH">WARNINGS, </a></span><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"><a href="#WMH">Metformin hydrochloride</a></span></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#DA">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>). </p>
<p>Before initiation of therapy with ACTOPLUS MET and at least annually thereafter, renal function should be assessed and verified as normal. In patients in whom development of renal dysfunction is anticipated, renal function should be assessed more frequently and ACTOPLUS MET discontinued if evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> is present. </p>
<p><span class="Underline">Use of concomitant medications that may affect renal function or metformin disposition</span>: <span class="Underline"></span>Concomitant medication(s) that may affect renal function or result in significant hemodynamic change or may interfere with the disposition of metformin, such as cationic drugs that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#PDIMH">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions, </a></span><span class="Italics"><a href="#PDIMH">Metformin hydrochloride</a></span>), should be used with caution. </p>
<p><span class="Underline">Radiologic studies involving the use of intravascular iodinated contrast materials (for example, intravenous urogram, intravenous cholangiography, angiography, and computed tomography (CT) scans with intravascular contrast materials)</span>: Intravascular contrast studies with iodinated materials can lead to acute alteration of renal function and have been associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span> in patients receiving metformin (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#C">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span>). Therefore, in patients in whom any such study is planned, ACTOPLUS MET should be temporarily discontinued at the time of or prior to the procedure, and withheld for 48 hours subsequent to the procedure and reinstituted only after renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be normal. </p>

<p><span class="Underline">Surgical procedures</span>: Use of ACTOPLUS MET should be temporarily suspended for any surgical procedure (except minor procedures not associated with restricted intake of food and fluids) and should not be restarted until the patient's oral intake has resumed and renal function has been evaluated as normal. </p>
<p><span class="Underline">Alcohol intake</span>:<span class="Bold"></span> Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients, therefore, should be warned against excessive alcohol intake, acute or chronic, while receiving ACTOPLUS MET. </p>

<h3><span class="Italics"> Metformin hydrochloride</span></h3>
<p class="First"><span class="Underline">Furosemide</span>:  A single-dose, metformin-furosemide drug interaction study in healthy subjects demonstrated that pharmacokinetic parameters of both compounds were affected by co-administration. Furosemide increased the metformin plasma and blood C<span class="Sub">max </span>by 22% and blood AUC by 15%, without any significant change in metformin renal clearance. When administered with metformin, the C<span class="Sub">max </span>and AUC of furosemide were 31% and 12% smaller, respectively, than when administered alone and the terminal half-life was decreased by 32%, without any significant change in furosemide renal clearance. No information is available about the interaction of metformin and furosemide when co-administered chronically.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Nifedipine</span>:  A single-dose, metformin-nifedipine drug interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that co-administration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin C<span class="Sub">max </span>and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively and increased the amount excreted in the urine. T<span class="Sub">max </span>and half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Metformin had minimal effects on nifedipine. </p>
<p><span class="Underline">Cationic Drugs</span>:  Cationic drugs (e.g., amiloride, digoxin, morphine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine, ranitidine, triamterene, trimethoprim, and vancomycin) that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion theoretically have the potential for interaction with metformin by competing for common renal tubular transport systems. Such interaction between metformin and oral cimetidine has been observed in normal healthy volunteers in both single- and multiple-dose, metformin-cimetidine drug interaction studies with a 60% increase in peak metformin plasma and whole blood concentrations and a 40% increase in plasma and whole blood metformin AUC. There was no change in elimination half-life in the single-dose study. Metformin had no effect on cimetidine pharmacokinetics. Although such interactions remain theoretical (except for cimetidine), careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of ACTOPLUS MET and/or the interfering drug is recommended in patients who are taking cationic medications that are excreted via the proximal renal tubular secretory system. </p>
<p><span class="Underline">Other</span>:  Certain drugs tend to produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span> and may lead to loss of glycemic control. These drugs include thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving ACTOPLUS MET, the patient should be closely observed to maintain adequate glycemic control. </p>
<p>In healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of metformin and propranolol and metformin and ibuprofen were not affected when co-administered in single-dose interaction studies. </p>
<p>Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins and is therefore, less likely to interact with highly protein-bound drugs such as salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol and probenecid. </p>

<h4> Pioglitazone hydrochloride</h4>
<p class="First">A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female rats at oral doses up to 63 mg/kg (approximately 14 times the maximum recommended human oral dose of 45 mg based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>).  Drug-induced tumors were not observed in any organ except for the urinary bladder.  Benign and/or malignant transitional cell neoplasms were observed in male rats at 4 mg/kg/day and above (approximately equal to the maximum recommended human oral dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female mice at oral doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (approximately 11 times the maximum recommended human oral dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>).  No drug-induced tumors were observed in any organ.</p>
<p>During prospective evaluation of urinary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="45771295" conceptname="Cytology">cytology</span> involving more than 1800 patients receiving pioglitazone in clinical trials up to one year in duration, no new cases of bladder tumors were identified. In two 3-year studies in which pioglitazone was compared to placebo or glyburide, there were 16/3656 (0.44%) reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="73153" conceptname="Malignant neoplasm of lateral wall of urinary bladder">bladder cancer</span> in patients taking pioglitazone compared to 5/3679 (0.14%) in patients not taking pioglitazone.  After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="73153" conceptname="Malignant neoplasm of lateral wall of urinary bladder">bladder cancer</span>, there were six (0.16%) cases on pioglitazone and two (0.05%) on placebo.  </p>
<p>Pioglitazone HCl was not mutagenic in a battery of genetic toxicology studies, including the  Ames bacterial assay, a mammalian cell forward gene mutation assay (CHO/HPRT and AS52/XPRT), an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> cytogenetics assay using CHL cells, an unscheduled DNA synthesis assay, and an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> micronucleus assay.</p>
<p>No adverse effects upon fertility were observed in male and female rats at oral doses up to 40 mg/kg pioglitazone HCl daily prior to and throughout mating and gestation (approximately 9 times the maximum recommended human oral dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>).  </p>

<h4> Metformin hydrochloride</h4>
<p class="First">Long-term carcinogenicity studies have been performed in rats (dosing duration of 104 weeks) and mice (dosing duration of 91 weeks) at doses up to and including 900 mg/kg/day and 1500 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are both approximately four times a human daily dose of 2000 mg of the metformin component of ACTOPLUS MET based on body surface area comparisons. No evidence of carcinogenicity with metformin was found in either male or female mice. Similarly, there was no tumorigenic potential observed with metformin in male rats. There was, however, an increased incidence of benign stromal uterine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4187628" conceptname="Polyp">polyps</span> in female rats treated with 900 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>There was no evidence of mutagenic potential of metformin in the following <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>tests: Ames test ( <span class="Italics">S. typhimurium </span>), gene mutation test (mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> cells), or chromosomal aberrations test (human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span>). Results in the <span class="Italics">in vivo </span>mouse micronucleus test were also negative. </p>
<p>Fertility of male or female rats was unaffected by metformin when administered at doses as high as 600 mg/kg/day, which is approximately three times the maximum recommended human daily dose of the metformin component of ACTOPLUS MET based on body surface area comparisons. </p>

<h3><span class="Italics"> ACTOPLUS MET</span></h3>
<p class="First">Because current information strongly suggests that abnormal blood glucose levels during pregnancy are associated with a higher incidence of congenital anomalies, as well as increased neonatal morbidity and mortality, most experts recommend that insulin be used during pregnancy to maintain blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible.  ACTOPLUS MET should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women with ACTOPLUS MET or its individual components.  No animal studies have been conducted with the combined products in ACTOPLUS MET.  The following data are based on findings in studies performed with pioglitazone or metformin individually.  </p>

<h4><span class="Italics"> Pioglitazone hydrochloride</span></h4>
<p class="First">Pioglitazone was not teratogenic in rats at oral doses up to 80 mg/kg or in rabbits given up to 160 mg/kg during organogenesis (approximately 17 and 40 times the maximum recommended human oral dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, respectively).  Delayed parturition and embryotoxicity (as evidenced by increased postimplantation losses, delayed development and reduced fetal weights) were observed in rats at oral doses of 40 mg/kg/day and above (approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human oral dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>).  No functional or behavioral toxicity was observed in offspring of rats.  In rabbits, embryotoxicity was observed at an oral dose of 160 mg/kg (approximately 40 times the maximum recommended human oral dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>).  Delayed postnatal development, attributed to decreased body weight, was observed in offspring of rats at oral doses of 10 mg/kg and above during late gestation and lactation periods (approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human oral dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>).</p>

<h2> Nursing Mothers  </h2>
<p class="First">No studies have been conducted with the combined components of ACTOPLUS MET.  In studies performed with the individual components, both pioglitazone and metformin are secreted in the milk of lactating rats.  It is not known whether pioglitazone and/or metformin is secreted in human milk.  Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, ACTOPLUS MET should not be administered to a breastfeeding woman. If ACTOPLUS MET is discontinued, and if diet alone is inadequate for controlling blood glucose, insulin therapy should be considered.  </p>

<p class="First">Controlled clinical studies of metformin did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients, although other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and young patients.  Metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and because the risk of serious adverse reactions to the drug is greater in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>, ACTOPLUS MET should only be used in patients with normal renal function (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#C">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span>, <span class="Bold"><a href="#WMH">WARNINGS, </a></span><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"><a href="#WMH">Metformin hydrochloride</a></span></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#CPSP">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Special Populations</a></span>). Because aging is associated with reduced renal function, ACTOPLUS MET should be used with caution as age increases. Care should be taken in dose selection and should be based on careful and regular monitoring of renal function. Generally, elderly patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of ACTOPLUS MET (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#WMH">WARNINGS, </a></span><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"><a href="#WMH">Metformin hydrochloride</a></span></span><span class="Bold"></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#DA">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).  </p>

<p><span class="Underline">CPK Levels</span>: During required laboratory testing in clinical trials with pioglitazone, sporadic, transient elevations in creatine phosphokinase levels (CPK) were observed.  An isolated elevation to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal was noted in 9 patients (values of 2150 to 11400 IU/L).  Six of these patients continued to receive pioglitazone, two patients had completed receiving study medication at the time of the elevated value and one patient discontinued study medication due to the elevation.  These elevations resolved without any apparent clinical sequelae.  The relationship of these events to pioglitazone therapy is unknown.</p>

<h2><span class="Italics"> General</span></h2>
<p class="First">The use of antihyperglycemic therapy in the management of type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> should be individualized on the basis of effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of pioglitazone 45 mg and metformin 2550 mg. </p>

<a name="section-11.2"></a><p></p>
<h2><span class="Italics"> Dosage Recommendations</span></h2>
<p class="First">Selecting the starting dose of ACTOPLUS MET should be based on the patient's current regimen of pioglitazone and/or metformin.  After initiation of ACTOPLUS MET or with dose increase, patients should be carefully monitored for adverse events related to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4125002" conceptname="Idiopathic fluid retention">fluid retention</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#boxed-warning">BOXED WARNING</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#WPH">WARNINGS</a>, <span class="Italics"><a href="#WPH">Pioglitazone hydrochloride</a></span></span>). ACTOPLUS MET should be given in divided daily doses with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal side effects associated with metformin. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Starting dose for patients inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy</span></p>
<p>Based on the usual starting dose of pioglitazone (15-30 mg daily), ACTOPLUS MET may be initiated at either the 15 mg/500 mg or 15 mg/850 mg tablet strength once or twice daily, and gradually titrated after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response.  </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Starting dose for patients who initially responded to pioglitazone monotherapy and require additional glycemic control </span></p>
<p>Based on the usual starting doses of metformin (500 mg twice daily or 850 mg daily), ACTOPLUS MET may be initiated at either the 15 mg/500 mg twice daily or 15 mg/850 mg tablet strength once daily, and gradually titrated after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response.  </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Starting dose for patients switching from combination therapy of pioglitazone plus metformin as separate tablets</span></p>
<p>ACTOPLUS MET may be initiated with either the 15 mg/500 mg or 15 mg/850 mg tablet strengths based on the dose of pioglitazone and metformin already being taken.  </p>
<p>No studies have been performed specifically examining the safety and efficacy of ACTOPLUS MET in patients previously treated with other oral hypoglycemic agents and switched to ACTOPLUS MET.  Any change in therapy of type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> should be undertaken with care and appropriate monitoring as changes in glycemic control can occur.  </p>
<p>Sufficient time should be given to assess adequacy of therapeutic response.  Ideally, the response to therapy should be evaluated using A1C, which is a better indicator of long-term glycemic control than FPG alone. A1C reflects glycemia over the past two to three months. In clinical use, it is recommended that patients be treated with ACTOPLUS MET for a period of time adequate to evaluate change in A1C (8-12 weeks) unless glycemic control as measured by FPG deteriorates. </p>

<h2><span class="Italics"> Special Patient Populations</span></h2>
<p class="First">ACTOPLUS MET is not recommended for use in pregnancy or for use in pediatric patients.</p>
<p>The initial and maintenance dosing of ACTOPLUS MET should be conservative in patients with advanced age, due to the potential for decreased renal function in this population. Any dosage adjustment should be based on a careful assessment of renal function. Generally, elderly, debilitated, and malnourished patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of ACTOPLUS MET. Monitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of metformin-associated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span>, particularly in the elderly (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#WMH">WARNINGS, </a></span><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"><a href="#WMH">Metformin hydrochloride</a></span></span><span class="Italics"></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#PGMH">PRECAUTIONS, General: </a></span><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"><a href="#PGMH">Metformin hydrochloride</a></span></span>).</p>
<p>Therapy with ACTOPLUS MET should not be initiated if the patient exhibits clinical evidence of active liver disease or increased serum transaminase levels (ALT greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal) at start of therapy (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#PGPH">PRECAUTIONS, General: </a></span><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"><a href="#PGPH">Pioglitazone hydrochloride</a></span></span><span class="Italics"></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#CPSPHI">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Special Populations, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">Hepatic Insufficiency</span></a></span>).
