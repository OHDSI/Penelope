<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</h1>
<p class="First">This combination drug product is intended as a treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="376382" conceptname="Tension-type headache">tension headache</span>.<br>It consists of a fixed combination of butalbital and acetaminophen. The role each component plays in the relief of the complex symptoms known as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="376382" conceptname="Tension-type headache">tension headache</span> is incompletely understood.</p>
<p><br><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics:</span> The behavior of the individual components is described below.<br>Butalbital: Butalbital is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is expected to distribute to most tissues in the body. Barbiturates in general may appear in breast milk and readily cross the placental barrier. They are bound to plasma and tissue proteins to a varying degree and binding increases directly as a function of lipid solubility.<br>Elimination of butalbital is primarily via the kidney (59% to 88% of the dose) as unchanged drug or metabolites. The plasma half-life is about 35 hours. Urinary excretion products include parent drug (about 3.6% of the dose), 5-isobutyl-5-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl) barbituric acid (about 24% of the dose), 5-allyl-5(3-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-propyl) barbituric acid (about 4.8% of the dose), products with the barbituric acid ring hydrolyzed with excretion of urea (about 14% of the dose), as well as unidentified materials. Of the material excreted in the urine, 32% is conjugated.<br>The in vitro plasma protein binding of butalbital is 45% over the concentration range of 0.5 to 20 mcg/mL. This <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falls</span> within the range of plasma protein binding (20% to 45%) reported with other barbiturates such as phenobarbital, pentobarbital, and secobarbital sodium. The plasma-to-blood concentration ratio was almost unity indicating that there is no preferential; distribution of butalbital into either plasma or blood cells (See <span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span> for toxicity information.).</p>
<p><br>Acetaminophen: Acetaminophen is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is distributed throughout most body tissues. The plasma half-life is 1.25 to 3 hours, but may be increased by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver damage</span> and following overdosage. Elimination of acetaminophen is principally by liver metabolism (conjugation) and subsequent renal excretion of metabolites. Approximately 85% of an oral dose appears in the urine within 24 hours of administration, most as the glucuronide conjugate, with small amounts of other conjugates and unchanged drug.<br>See <span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span> for toxicity information.</p>

Such tasks should be avoided while taking this product.<br>Alcohol and other CNS depressants may produce an additive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span>, when taken with this combination product, and should be avoided.<br>Butalbital may be habit-forming. Patients should take the drug only for as long as it is prescribed, in the amounts prescribed, and no more frequently than prescribed.</p>
<p><br><span class="Bold">Laboratory Tests:</span> In patients with severe hepatic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>, effects of therapy should be monitored with serial liver and/or renal function tests.</p>
<p><br><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions:</span> The CNS effects of butalbital may be enhanced by monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors.<br>Butalbital and acetaminophen may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions:</span> Acetaminophen may produce false-positive test results for urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid.</p>
<p><br><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:</span> No adequate studies have been conducted in animals to determine whether acetaminophen or butalbital have a potential for carcinogenesis, mutagenesis or impairment of fertility.</p>
<p><br><span class="Bold">Pregnancy</span>: Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with this combination product. It is also not known whether butalbital and acetaminophen can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. This product should be given to a pregnant woman only when clearly needed.<br><span class="Italics">Nonteratogenic Effects:</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218977" conceptname="Drug withdrawal seizure">Withdrawal seizures</span> were reported in a twoday-old male infant whose mother had taken a butalbital-containing drug during the last two months of pregnancy. Butalbital was found in the infantâ€™s serum. The infant was given phenobarbital 5 mg/kg, which was tapered without further <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> or other withdrawal symptoms.</p>
<p><br><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers:</span> Barbiturates and acetaminophen are excreted in breast milk in small amounts, but the significance of their effects on nursing infants is not known. Because of potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from butalbital and acetaminophen, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use</span>: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Geriatric Use:</span> Clinical studies of butalbital and acetaminophen tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.<br>Butalbital is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p>

The average daily dose for the barbiturate addict is usually about 1500 mg. As tolerance to barbiturates develops, the amount needed to maintain the same level of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> increases; tolerance to a fatal dosage, however, does not increase more than two-fold. As this occurs, the margin between an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> dosage and fatal dosage becomes smaller. The lethal dose of a barbiturate is far less if alcohol is also ingested.

Intensity of withdrawal symptoms gradually declines over a period of approximately 15 days. Treatment of barbiturate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> consists of cautious and gradual withdrawal of the drug. Barbiturate-dependent patients can be withdrawn by using a number of different withdrawal regimens.

<p><br><span class="Bold">Signs and Symptoms:</span> Toxicity from barbiturate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">poisoning</span> includes <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>; and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192647" conceptname="Hypovolemic shock">hypovolemic shock</span>.<br>In <span class="Underline">acetaminophen</span> overdosage: dose-dependent, potentially fatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4337543" conceptname="Hepatic necrosis">hepatic necrosis</span> is the most serious adverse effect. Renal tubular necroses, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380688" conceptname="Hypoglycemic coma">hypoglycemic coma</span> and coagulation defects may also occur. Early symptoms following a potentially hepatotoxic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> may include: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">diaphoresis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4272240" conceptname="Malaise">general malaise</span>. Clinical and laboratory evidence of hepatic toxicity may not be apparent until 48 to 72 hours post-ingestion.</p>
<p><br><span class="Bold">Treatment:</span> A single or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">multiple drug overdose</span> with butalbital and acetaminophen is a potentially lethal polydrug <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, and consultation with a regional poison control center is recommended. Immediate treatment includes support of cardiorespiratory function and measures to reduce drug absorption.<br>Oxygen, intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and other supportive measures should be employed as indicated. Assisted or controlled ventilation should also be considered.<br>Gastric decontamination with activated charcoal should be administered just prior to N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to decrease systemic absorption if acetaminophen ingestion is known or suspected to have occurred within a few hours of presentation. Serum acetaminophen levels should be obtained immediately if the patient presents 4 hours or more after ingestion to assess potential risk of hepatotoxicity; acetaminophen levels drawn less than 4 hours post-ingestion may be misleading. To obtain the best possible outcome, NAC should be administered as soon as possible where impending or evolving <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver injury</span> is suspected. Intravenous NAC may be administered when circumstances preclude oral administration.<br>Vigorous supportive therapy is required in severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>. Procedures to limit the continuing absorption of the drug must be readily performed since the hepatic injury is dose dependent and occurs early in the course of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>.</p>
