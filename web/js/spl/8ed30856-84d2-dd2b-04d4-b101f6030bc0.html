<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Buspirone hydrochloride tablets USP are an antianxiety agent that is not chemically or pharmacologically related to the benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or other sedative/anxiolytic drugs.</p>
<p>Buspirone hydrochloride is a white crystalline, water soluble compound. Chemically, buspirone hydrochloride is <span class="Italics">N</span>-[4-[4-(2-pyrimidinyl)-1-piperazinyl]butyl]-1,1-cyclopentanediacetamide monohydrochloride, which can be represented by the following structural formula:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="Structural Formula" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=8ed30856-84d2-dd2b-04d4-b101f6030bc0&amp;name=01a1a478-8ad4-48f5-b5b2-acf79c05c7b4-01.jpg"></div>

<p>Each tablet, for oral administration, contains 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg or 30 mg of buspirone hydrochloride USP (equivalent to 4.6 mg, 9.1 mg, 13.7 mg and 27.4 mg of buspirone free base, respectively). The 5 mg and 10 mg tablets are scored so they can be bisected. Thus, the 5 mg tablet can also provide a 2.5 mg dose, and the 10 mg tablet can provide a 5 mg dose. The 15 mg tablets are scored such that they may be bisected or trisected. Thus, a single tablet can provide the following doses: 15 mg (entire tablet), 10 mg (two-thirds of a tablet), 7.5 mg (one-half of a tablet), or 5 mg (one-third of a tablet). The 30 mg tablets are scored such that they may be bisected or trisected. Thus, a single tablet can provide the following doses: 30 mg (entire tablet), 20 mg (two-thirds of a tablet), 15 mg (one-half of a tablet), or 10 mg (one-third of a tablet). Buspirone hydrochloride tablets USP contain the following inactive ingredients: anhydrous lactose, colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, and sodium starch glycolate.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">The mechanism of action of buspirone is unknown. Buspirone differs from typical benzodiazepine anxiolytics in that it does not exert anticonvulsant or muscle relaxant effects. It also lacks the prominent sedative effect that is associated with more typical anxiolytics. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> preclinical studies have shown that buspirone has a high affinity for serotonin (5-HT<span class="Sub">1A</span>) receptors. Buspirone has no significant affinity for benzodiazepine receptors and does not affect GABA binding <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> or <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> when tested in preclinical models.</p>
<p>Buspirone has moderate affinity for brain D<span class="Sub">2</span>-dopamine receptors. Some studies do suggest that buspirone may have indirect effects on other neurotransmitter systems.</p>
<p>Buspirone hydrochloride tablets are rapidly absorbed in man and undergo extensive first-pass metabolism. In a radiolabeled study, unchanged buspirone in the plasma accounted for only about 1% of the radioactivity in the plasma. Following oral administration, plasma concentrations of unchanged buspirone are very low and variable between subjects. Peak plasma levels of 1 to 6 ng/mL have been observed 40 to 90 minutes after single oral doses of 20 mg. The single-dose bioavailability of unchanged buspirone when taken as a tablet is on the average about 90% of an equivalent dose of solution, but there is large variability.</p>
<p>The effects of food upon the bioavailability of buspirone hydrochloride tablets have been studied in eight subjects. They were given a 20 mg dose with and without food; the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and peak plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of unchanged buspirone increased by 84% and 116%, respectively, but the total amount of buspirone immunoreactive material did not change. This suggests that food may decrease the extent of presystemic clearance of buspirone (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p>
<p>A multiple-dose study conducted in 15 subjects suggests that buspirone has nonlinear pharmacokinetics. Thus, dose increases and repeated dosing may lead to somewhat higher blood levels of unchanged buspirone than would be predicted from results of single-dose studies.</p>
<p>An <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>protein binding study indicated that approximately 86% of buspirone is bound to plasma proteins. It was also observed that aspirin increased the plasma levels of free buspirone by 23%, while flurazepam decreased the plasma levels of free buspirone by 20%. However, it is not known whether these drugs cause similar effects on plasma levels of free buspirone <span class="Italics">in vivo</span>, or whether such changes, if they do occur, cause clinically significant differences in treatment outcome. An <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> study indicated that buspirone did not displace highly protein-bound drugs such as phenytoin, warfarin, and propranolol from plasma protein, and that buspirone may displace digoxin.</p>
<p>Buspirone is metabolized primarily by oxidation, which <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> has been shown to be mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>, <span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span>). Several hydroxylated derivatives and a pharmacologically active metabolite, 1-pyrimidinylpiperazine (1-PP), are produced. In animal models predictive of anxiolytic potential, 1-PP has about one quarter of the activity of buspirone, but is present in up to 20 fold greater amounts. However, this is probably not important in humans: blood samples from humans chronically exposed to buspirone hydrochloride tablets do not exhibit high levels of 1-PP; mean values are approximately 3 ng/mL and the highest human blood level recorded among 108 chronically dosed patients was 17 ng/mL, less than 1/200th of 1-PP levels found in animals given large doses of buspirone without signs of toxicity.</p>
<p>In a single-dose study using <span class="Sup">14</span>C-labeled buspirone, 29% to 63% of the dose was excreted in the urine within 24 hours, primarily as metabolites; fecal excretion accounted for 18% to 38% of the dose. The average elimination half-life of unchanged buspirone after single doses of 10 to 40 mg is about 2 to 3 hours.</p>

<h3>Interference With Cognitive and Motor Performance</h3>
<p class="First">Studies indicate that buspirone hydrochloride tablets is less sedating than other anxiolytics and that it does not produce significant functional impairment. However, its CNS effects in any individual patient may not be predictable. Therefore, patients should be cautioned about operating an automobile or using complex machinery until they are reasonably certain that buspirone treatment does not affect them adversely.</p>
<p>While formal studies of the interaction of buspirone hydrochloride with alcohol indicate that buspirone does not increase alcohol-induced impairment in motor and mental performance, it is prudent to avoid concomitant use of alcohol and buspirone.</p>

<h3>Potential for Withdrawal Reactions in Sedative/Hypnotic/Anxiolytic Drug-Dependent Patients</h3>
<p class="First">Because buspirone hydrochloride tablets do not exhibit cross-tolerance with benzodiazepines and other common sedative/hypnotic drugs, it will not block the withdrawal syndrome often seen with cessation of therapy with these drugs. Therefore, before starting therapy with buspirone hydrochloride tablets, it is advisable to withdraw patients gradually, especially patients who have been using a CNS-depressant drug chronically, from their prior treatment. Rebound or withdrawal symptoms may occur over varying time periods, depending in part on the type of drug, and its effective half-life of elimination.</p>
<p>The syndrome of withdrawal from sedative/hypnotic/anxiolytic drugs can appear as any combination of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal cramps</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75635" conceptname="Cramp">muscle cramps</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span>, flu-like symptoms without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, and occasionally, even as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>.</p>

<h3>Possible Concerns Related to Buspironeâ€™s Binding to Dopamine Receptors</h3>
<p class="First">Because buspirone can bind to central dopamine receptors, a question has been raised about its potential to cause acute and chronic changes in dopamine-mediated neurological function (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375800" conceptname="Dystonia">dystonia</span>, pseudo-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4140090" conceptname="Parkinsonism">parkinsonism</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4108925" conceptname="Akathisia">akathisia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>). Clinical experience in controlled trials has failed to identify any significant neuroleptic-like activity; however, a syndrome of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">restlessness</span>, appearing shortly after initiation of treatment, has been reported in some small fraction of buspirone-treated patients. The syndrome may be explained in several ways. For example, buspirone may increase central noradrenergic activity; alternatively, the effect may be attributable to dopaminergic effects (i.e., represent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4108925" conceptname="Akathisia">akathisia</span>).

<h4>Trazodone</h4>
<p class="First">There is one report suggesting that the concomitant use of trazodone hydrochloride and buspirone may have caused 3 to 6 fold elevations on SGPT (ALT) in a few patients.

<h3>Inhibitors and Inducers of Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4)</h3>
<p class="First">Buspirone has been shown <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> to be metabolized by CYP3A4. This finding is consistent with the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> interactions observed between buspirone and the following:</p>

<h4>Diltiazem and verapamil</h4>
<p class="First">In a study of nine healthy volunteers, coadministration of buspirone (10 mg as a single dose) with verapamil (80 mg t.i.d.) or diltiazem (60 mg t.i.d.) increased plasma buspirone concentrations (verapamil increased AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of buspirone 3.4 fold while diltiazem increased AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> 5.5 fold and 4 fold, respectively). Adverse events attributable to buspirone may be more likely during concomitant administration with either diltiazem or verapamil.

<h4>Erythromycin</h4>
<p class="First">In a study in healthy volunteers, coadministration of buspirone (10 mg as a single dose) with erythromycin (1.5 g/day for 4 days) increased plasma buspirone concentrations (5 fold increase in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and 6 fold increase in AUC). These <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interactions</span> were accompanied by an increased incidence of side effects attributable to buspirone.

<h4>Grapefruit juice</h4>
<p class="First">In a study in healthy volunteers, coadministration of buspirone (10 mg as a single dose) with grapefruit juice (200 mL double-strength t.i.d. for 2 days) increased plasma buspirone concentrations (4.3 fold increase in C<span class="Sub">max</span>; 9.2 fold increase in AUC).

<h4>Itraconazole</h4>
<p class="First">In a study in healthy volunteers, coadministration of buspirone (10 mg as a single dose) with itraconazole (200 mg/day for 4 days) increased plasma buspirone concentrations (13 fold increase in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and 19 fold increase in AUC).

<h4>Nefazodone</h4>
<p class="First">In a study of steady-state pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers, coadministration of buspirone (2.5 or 5 mg b.i.d.) with nefazodone (250 mg b.i.d.) resulted in marked increases in plasma buspirone concentrations (increases up to 20 fold in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and up to 50 fold in AUC) and statistically significant decreases (about 50%) in plasma concentrations of the buspirone metabolite 1-PP. With 5 mg b.i.d. doses of buspirone, slight increases in AUC were observed for nefazodone (23%) and its metabolites hydroxynefazodone (HO-NEF) (17%) and meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (9%). Slight increases in C<span class="Sub">max</span> were observed for nefazodone (8%) and its metabolite HO-NEF (11%). Subjects receiving buspirone 5 mg b.i.d. and nefazodone 250 mg b.i.d. experienced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">lightheadedness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">asthenia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, adverse events also observed with either drug alone. If the two drugs are to be used in combination, a low dose of buspirone (e.g., 2.5 mg q.d.) is recommended. Subsequent dose adjustment of either drug should be based on clinical assessment.</p>

<h4>Rifampin</h4>
<p class="First">In a study in healthy volunteers, coadministration of buspirone (30 mg as a single dose) with rifampin (600 mg/day for 5 days) decreased the plasma concentrations (83.7% decrease in C<span class="Sub">max</span>; 89.6% decrease in AUC) and pharmacodynamic effects of buspirone. If the two drugs are to be used in combination, the dosage of buspirone may need adjusting to maintain anxiolytic effect.</p>
</div>

<h4>Other inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4</h4>
<p class="First">Substances that inhibit CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole or ritonavir, may inhibit buspirone metabolism and increase plasma concentrations of buspirone while substances that induce CYP3A4, such as dexamethasone or certain anticonvulsants (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), may increase the rate of buspirone metabolism. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on buspirone, a dose adjustment of buspirone may be necessary to avoid adverse events attributable to buspirone or diminished anxiolytic activity. Consequently, when administered with a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, a low dose of buspirone used cautiously is recommended. When used in combination with a potent inducer of CYP3A4 the dosage of buspirone may need adjusting to maintain anxiolytic effect.</p>

<h4>Cimetidine</h4>
<p class="First">Coadministration of buspirone with cimetidine was found to increase C<span class="Sub">max</span> (40%) and T<span class="Sub">max</span> (2 fold), but had minimal effects on the AUC of buspirone.</p>

<h3>Protein Binding</h3>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro</span>, buspirone does not displace tightly bound drugs like phenytoin, propanolol, and warfarin from serum proteins. However, there has been one report of prolonged <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time when buspirone was added to the regimen of a patient treated with warfarin. The patient was also chronically receiving phenytoin, phenobarbital, digoxin, and levothyroxine sodium. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span>, buspirone may displace less firmly bound drugs like digoxin. The clinical significance of this property is unknown.</p>
<p>Therapeutic levels of aspirin, desipramine, diazepam, flurazepam, ibuprofen, propranolol, thioridazine, and tolbutamide had only a limited effect on the extent of binding of buspirone to plasma proteins (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>).</p>

<h2>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Buspirone hydrochloride may interfere with the urinary metanephrine/catecholamine assay. It has been mistakenly read as metanephrine during routine assay testing for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118993" conceptname="Pheochromocytoma">pheochromocytoma</span>, resulting in a false positive laboratory result. Buspirone hydrochloride should therefore be discontinued for at least 48 hours prior to undergoing a urine collection for catecholamines.</p>

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of buspirone were evaluated in two placebo-controlled 6 week trials involving a total of 559 pediatric patients (ranging from 6 to 17 years of age) with GAD. Doses studied were 7.5 mg to 30 mg b.i.d. (15 to 60 mg/day). There were no significant differences between buspirone and placebo with regard to the symptoms of GAD following doses recommended for the treatment of GAD in adults. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that, for identical doses, plasma exposure to buspirone and its active metabolite, 1-PP, are equal to or higher in pediatric patients than adults. No unexpected safety findings were associated with buspirone in these trials. There are no long-term safety or efficacy data in this population.</p>

<h2>Use in Patients With Impaired Hepatic or Renal Function</h2>
<p class="First">Buspirone is metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys.

<h2>Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials</h2>
<p class="First">The table that follows enumerates adverse events that occurred at a frequency of 1% or more among buspirone hydrochloride patients who participated in 4 week, controlled trials comparing buspirone hydrochloride tablets with placebo. The frequencies were obtained from pooled data for 17 trials. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those which prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. Comparison of the cited figures, however, does provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side-effect incidence rate in the population studied.</p>

<h2>Other Events Observed During the Entire Premarketing Evaluation of Buspirone Hydrochloride Tablets</h2>
<p class="First">During its premarketing assessment, buspirone hydrochloride tablets were evaluated in over 3500 subjects. This section reports event frequencies for adverse events occurring in approximately 3000 subjects from this group who took multiple doses of buspirone hydrochloride tablets in the dose range for which buspirone is being recommended (i.e., the modal daily dose of buspirone hydrochloride tablets fell between 10 and 30 mg for 70% of the patients studied) and for whom safety data were systematically collected. The conditions and duration of exposure to buspirone hydrochloride tablets varied greatly, involving well-controlled studies as well as experience in open and uncontrolled clinical settings. As part of the total experience gained in clinical studies, various adverse events were reported. In the absence of appropriate controls in some of the studies, a causal relationship to buspirone hydrochloride treatment cannot be determined. The list includes all undesirable events reasonably associated with the use of the drug.</p>
<p>The following enumeration by organ system describes events in terms of their relative frequency of reporting in this data base. Events of major clinical importance are also described in the <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS </span>section.</p>
<p>The following definitions of frequency are used: Frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients. Infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients, while rare events are those occurring in less than 1/1000 patients.</p>

<h2>Physical and Psychological <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">Dependence</span></h2>
<p class="First">In human and animal studies, buspirone has shown no potential for abuse or diversion and there is no evidence that it causes tolerance, or either physical or psychological <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>. Human volunteers with a history of recreational drug or alcohol usage were studied in two double-blind clinical investigations. None of the subjects were able to distinguish between buspirone hydrochloride tablets and placebo. By contrast, subjects showed a statistically significant preference for methaqualone and diazepam. Studies in monkeys, mice, and rats have indicated that buspirone lacks potential for abuse.</p>
<p>Following chronic administration in the rat, abrupt withdrawal of buspirone did not result in the loss of body weight commonly observed with substances that cause physical dependency.</p>
<p>Although there is no direct evidence that buspirone hydrochloride tablets cause physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> or drug-seeking behavior, it is difficult to predict from experiments the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed. Consequently, physicians should carefully evaluate patients for a history of drug abuse and follow such patients closely, observing them for signs of buspirone hydrochloride tablets misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, incrementation of dose, drug-seeking behavior).</p>

<h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
<p class="First">In clinical pharmacology trials, doses as high as 375 mg/day were administered to healthy male volunteers. As this dose was approached, the following symptoms were observed: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435279" conceptname="Tonic pupillary reaction">miosis</span>, and gastric distress. A few cases of overdosage have been reported, with complete recovery as the usual outcome. No <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> have been reported following overdosage with buspirone hydrochloride tablets alone. Rare cases of intentional overdosage with a fatal outcome were invariably associated with ingestion of multiple drugs and/or alcohol, and a causal relationship to buspirone could not be determined. Toxicology studies of buspirone yielded the following LD<span class="Sub">50</span> values: mice, 655 mg/kg; rats, 196 mg/kg; dogs, 586 mg/kg; and monkeys, 356 mg/kg. These dosages are 160 to 550 times the recommended human daily dose.</p>

<h2>Recommended <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">Overdose</span> Treatment</h2>
<p class="First">General symptomatic and supportive measures should be used along with immediate gastric lavage. Respiration, pulse, and blood pressure should be monitored as in all cases of drug overdosage. No specific antidote is known to buspirone, and dialyzability of buspirone has not been determined.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">The recommended initial dose is 15 mg daily (7.5 mg b.i.d.). To achieve an optimal therapeutic response, at intervals of 2 to 3 days the dosage may be increased 5 mg per day, as needed. The maximum daily dosage should not exceed 60 mg per day. In clinical trials allowing dose titration, divided doses of 20 to 30 mg per day were commonly employed.</p>
<p>The bioavailability of buspirone is increased when given with food as compared to the fasted state (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>). Consequently, patients should take buspirone in a consistent manner with regard to the timing of dosing; either always with or always without food.</p>
<p>When buspirone is to be given with a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, the dosage recommendations described in the <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>, <span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span> section should be followed.</p>
