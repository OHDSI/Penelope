<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of total <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> (total-C), low density lipoprotein <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> (LDL-C), and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4122128" conceptname="Apolipoprotein">apolipoprotein</span> B (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4098284" conceptname="Apolipoprotein B">apo B</span>), an LDL membrane complex, are associated with human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103842" conceptname="Arteriosclerosis">atherosclerosis</span>. Similarly, decreased levels of high density lipoprotein <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> (HDL-C) and its transport complex, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4122128" conceptname="Apolipoprotein">apolipoprotein</span> A (apo A<span class="Bold">I </span>and apo A<span class="Bold">II</span>) are associated with the development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103842" conceptname="Arteriosclerosis">atherosclerosis</span>. Epidemiologic investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of total-C, LDL-C, and triglycerides, and inversely with the level of HDL-C. The independent effect of raising HDL-C or lowering triglycerides (TG) on the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.</p>
<p>Fenofibric acid, the active metabolite of fenofibrate, produces reductions in total <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>, LDL <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4122128" conceptname="Apolipoprotein">apolipoprotein</span> B, total triglycerides, and triglyceride rich lipoprotein (VLDL) in treated patients. In addition, treatment with fenofibrate results in increases in high density lipoprotein (HDL) and apoproteins apo A<span class="Bold">I </span>and apo A<span class="Bold">II.</span></p>
<p>The effects of fenofibric acid seen in clinical practice have been explained <span class="Italics">in vivo </span>in transgenic mice and <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>in human hepatocyte cultures by the activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα).</p>
<p>Through this mechanism, fenofibrate increases lipolysis and elimination of triglyceride-rich particles from plasma by activating lipoprotein lipase and reducing production of apoprotein C-<span class="Bold">III </span>(an inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase activity). The resulting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> in triglycerides produces an alteration in the size and composition of LDL from small, dense particles (which are thought to be atherogenic due to their susceptibility to oxidation), to large buoyant particles. These larger particles have a greater affinity for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> receptors and are catabolized rapidly. Activation of PPARα also induces an increase in the synthesis of apoproteins A-<span class="Bold">I, </span>A-<span class="Bold">II </span>and HDL-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>.</p>
<p>Fenofibrate also reduces serum uric acid levels in hyperuricemic and normal individuals by increasing the urinary excretion of uric acid.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics/Metabolism</h2>
<p class="First">Plasma concentrations of fenofibric acid after multiple dose administration of Antara 130 mg capsules are equivalent, under low-fat fed conditions, to 200 mg fenofibrate capsules.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Absorption: </span>The absolute bioavailability of fenofibrate cannot be determined as the compound is virtually insoluble in aqueous media suitable for injection. However, fenofibrate is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Following oral administration in healthy volunteers, approximately 60% of a single dose of radiolabelled fenofibrate appeared in urine, primarily as fenofibric acid and its glucuronate conjugate, and 25% was excreted in the feces. Peak plasma levels of fenofibric acid from Antara occur within 4 to 8 hours after administration.</p>
<p>There was less than dose-proportional increase in the systemic exposure of fenofibric acid from three strengths (43 mg, 87 mg, and 130 mg) of Antara under fasting conditions.</p>
<p>Doses of two- or three-capsules of 43 mg Antara given concurrently were dose-equivalent to single-capsule doses of 87 mg and 130 mg, respectively.</p>
<p>The extent of absorption of acid was unaffected when Antara was taken either in fasted state or with a low-fat meal. However, the C<span class="Sub">max</span> of Antara increased in the presence of a low-fat meal. T<span class="Sub">max</span> was unaffected in the presence of a low-fat meal. In the presence of a high-fat meal, there was a 26% increase in AUC and 108% increase in C<span class="Sub">max</span> of fenofibric acid from Antara relative to fasting state.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Distribution: </span>In healthy volunteers, steady-state plasma levels of fenofibric acid were shown to be achieved within a week of dosing and did not demonstrate accumulation across time following multiple dose administration. Serum protein binding was approximately 99% in normal and hyperlipidemic subjects.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Metabolism: </span>Following oral administration, fenofibrate is rapidly hydrolyzed by esterases to the active metabolite, fenofibric acid; no unchanged fenofibrate is detected in plasma.</p>
<p>Fenofibric acid is primarily conjugated with glucuronic acid and then excreted in urine. A small amount of fenofibric acid is reduced at the carbonyl moiety to a benzhydrol metabolite which is, in turn, conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted in urine.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vivo </span>metabolism data indicate that neither fenofibrate nor fenofibric acid undergo oxidative metabolism (e.g., cytochrome P450) to a significant extent.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Excretion: </span>After absorption, fenofibrate is mainly excreted in the urine in the form of metabolites, primarily fenofibric acid and fenofibric acid glucuronide. After administration of radiolabelled fenofibrate, approximately 60% of the dose appeared in the urine and 25% was excreted in the feces.</p>
<p>Fenofibrate acid from Antara is eliminated with a half-life of 23 hours, allowing once daily administration in a clinical setting.</p>

<h2>Special Populations</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Geriatrics: </span>In elderly volunteers 77– 87 years of age, the oral clearance of fenofibric acid following a single oral dose of fenofibrate was 1.2 L/h, which compares to 1.1 L/h in young adults. This indicates that a similar dosage regimen can be used in the elderly, without increasing accumulation of the drug or metabolites.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Pediatrics: </span>Antara has not been investigated in adequate and well-controlled trials in pediatric patients.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Gender: </span>No pharmacokinetic difference between males and females has been observed for fenofibrate.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Race: </span>The influence of race on the pharmacokinetics of fenofibrate has not been studied; however, fenofibrate is not metabolized by enzymes known for exhibiting inter-ethnic variability. Therefore, inter-ethnic pharmacokinetic differences are very unlikely.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal insufficiency</span>: </span>In a study in patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min), the rate of clearance of fenofibric acid was greatly reduced, and the compound accumulated during chronic dosage. However, in patients having moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (creatinine clearance of 50 to 90 mL/min), the oral clearance and the oral volume of distribution of fenofibric acid are increased compared to healthy adults (2.1 L/h and 95 L versus 1.1 L/h and 30 L, respectively). Therefore, the dosage of Antara should be minimized in patients who have severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, while no modification of dosage is required in patients having moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">Hepatic insufficiency</span>: </span>No pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in patients having <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic insufficiency</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Drug-drug interactions: </span><span class="Italics">In vitro </span>studies using human liver microsomes indicate that fenofibrate and fenofibric acid are not inhibitors of cytochrome (CYP) P450 isoforms CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP1A2. They are weak inhibitors of CYP2C19 and CYP2A6, and mild-to-moderate inhibitors of CYP2C9 at therapeutic concentrations.</p>
<p>Potentiation of coumarin-type anticoagulants has been observed with prolongation of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time/INR.</p>
<p>Bile acid sequestrants have been shown to bind other drugs given concurrently. Therefore, fenofibrate should be taken at least 1 hour before or 4-6 hours after a bile acid binding resin to avoid impeding its absorption (see<span class="Bold"><a href="#AA31B867-41ED-4BBB-9E02-C32DF9D2BD33">WARNINGS</a></span> and<span class="Bold"><a href="#AD29B416-E682-4ED7-98A5-D785891C2209">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>).</p>

<h2>Treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440360" conceptname="Pure hyperglyceridemia">Hypertriglyceridemia</span></h2>
<p class="First">Antara is also indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for treatment of adult patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440360" conceptname="Pure hyperglyceridemia">hypertriglyceridemia</span> (Fredrickson Types <span class="Bold">IV </span>and <span class="Bold">V </span><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432867" conceptname="Hyperlipidemia">hyperlipidemia</span>). Improving glycemic control in diabetic patients showing fasting chylomicronemia will usually reduce fasting triglycerides and eliminate chylomicronemia thereby obviating the need for pharmacologic intervention.</p>
<p>Markedly elevated levels of serum triglycerides (e.g. &gt;2,000 mg/dL) may increase the risk of developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192640" conceptname="Pancreatitis">pancreatitis</span>. The effect of Antara therapy on reducing this risk has not been adequately studied.</p>
<p>Drug therapy is not indicated for patients with Type <span class="Bold">I </span><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432867" conceptname="Hyperlipidemia">hyperlipoproteinemia</span>, who have elevations of chylomicrons and plasma triglycerides, but who have normal levels of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL).

<p>The initial treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4159131" conceptname="Dyslipidemia">dyslipidemia</span> is dietary therapy specific for the type of lipoprotein abnormality. Excess body weight and excess alcoholic intake may be important factors in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440360" conceptname="Pure hyperglyceridemia">hypertriglyceridemia</span> and should be addressed prior to any drug therapy. Physical exercise can be an important ancillary measure. Diseases contributory to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432867" conceptname="Hyperlipidemia">hyperlipidemia</span>, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140673" conceptname="Hypothyroidism">hypothyroidism</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus should be looked for and adequately treated. Estrogen therapy, like thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers, is sometimes associated with massive rises in plasma triglycerides, especially in subjects with familial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440360" conceptname="Pure hyperglyceridemia">hypertriglyceridemia</span>. In such cases, discontinuation of the specific etiologic agent may obviate the need for specific drug therapy of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440360" conceptname="Pure hyperglyceridemia">hypertriglyceridemia</span>.</p>
<p>The use of drugs should be considered only when reasonable attempts have been made to obtain satisfactory results with non-drug methods. If the decision is made to use drugs, the patient should be instructed that this does not reduce the importance of adhering to diet (see<span class="Bold"><a href="#AA31B867-41ED-4BBB-9E02-C32DF9D2BD33">WARNINGS</a></span> and<span class="Bold"><a href="#AD29B416-E682-4ED7-98A5-D785891C2209">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>).</p>

<a name="section-6.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Liver Function</h2>
<p class="First">Fenofibrate at doses equivalent to 87 mg to 130 mg Antara per day has been associated with increases in serum transaminases [AST (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4094657" conceptname="Aspartate aminotransferase">SGOT</span>) or ALT (SGPT)]. In a pooled analysis of 10 placebo-controlled trials, increases to &gt;3 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 5.3% of patients taking fenofibrate versus 1.1% of patients treated with placebo.</p>
<p>When transaminase determinations were followed either after discontinuation of treatment or during continued treatment, a return to normal limits was usually observed. The incidence of increases in transaminases related to fenofibrate therapy appear to be dose related. In an 8-week dose-ranging study, the incidence of ALT or AST elevations to at least three times the upper limit of normal was 13% in patients receiving dosages equivalent to 87 mg to 130 mg Antara per day and was 0% in those receiving dosages equivalent to 43 mg or less Antara per day, or placebo. Hepatocellular, chronic active and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4318541" conceptname="Cholestatic hepatitis">cholestatic hepatitis</span> associated with fenofibrate therapy have been reported after exposures of weeks to several years. In extremely rare cases, cirrhosis has been reported in association with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4026125" conceptname="Chronic active hepatitis">chronic active hepatitis</span>.</p>
<p>Regular periodic monitoring of liver function, including serum ALT (SGPT) should be performed for the duration of therapy with Antara, and therapy discontinued if enzyme levels persist above three times the normal limit.</p>

The dosage of the anticoagulant should be reduced to maintain the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time/INR at the desired level to prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> complications. Frequent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time/INR determinations are advisable until it has been definitely determined that the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time/INR has stabilized.</p>

<h2>Concomitant HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors</h2>
<p class="First">The combined use of Antara and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be avoided unless the benefit of further alterations in lipid levels is likely to outweigh the increased risk of this drug combination.</p>
<p>In a single-dose drug interaction study in 23 healthy adults the concomitant administration of fenofibrate and pravastatin resulted in no clinically important difference in the pharmacokinetics of fenofibric acid, pravastatin, or its active metabolite 3α-hydroxy iso-pravastatin when compared to either drug given alone.</p>
<p>The combined use of fibric acid derivatives and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors has been associated, in the absence of a marked <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interaction</span>, in numerous case reports, with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4230337" conceptname="Rhabdomyolysis">rhabdomyolysis</span>, markedly elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439142" conceptname="Myoglobinuria">myoglobinuria</span>, leading in a high proportion of cases to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span>.</p>

<h2>Mortality</h2>
<p class="First">The effect of Antara on coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality and non-cardiovascular mortality has not been established.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-6.6"></a><p></p>
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<p class="First">In the Coronary Drug Project, a large study of post <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> of patients treated for 5 years with clofibrate, there was no difference in mortality seen between the clofibrate group and the placebo group. There was however, a difference in the rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4098112" conceptname="Biliary sludge">cholelithiasis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192956" conceptname="Cholecystitis">cholecystitis</span> requiring surgery between the two groups (3.0% vs. 1.8%).</p>
<p>Because of chemical, pharmacological, and clinical similarities between Atromid-S (clofibrate), and Lopid (gemfibrozil), the adverse findings in 4 large randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies with these other fibrate drugs may also apply to Antara.</p>
<p>In a study conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), 5000 subjects without known <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317576" conceptname="Coronary arteriosclerosis">coronary artery disease</span> were treated with placebo or clofibrate for 5 years and followed for an additional one year. There was a statistically significant, higher age-adjusted all-cause mortality in the clofibrate group compared with the placebo group (5.70% vs. 3.96%, p=&lt;0.01). Excess mortality was due to a 33% increase in non-cardiovascular causes, including malignancy, post-cholecystectomy complications, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192640" conceptname="Pancreatitis">pancreatitis</span>. This appeared to confirm the higher risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192353" conceptname="Disorder of gallbladder">gallbladder disease</span> seen in clofibrate-treated patients studied in the Coronary Drug Project.</p>
<p>The Helsinki Heart Study was a large (n=4081) study of middle-aged men without a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317576" conceptname="Coronary arteriosclerosis">coronary artery disease</span>. Subjects received either placebo or gemfibrozil for 5 years, with a 3.5 year open extension afterward. Total mortality was numerically higher in the gemfibrozil randomization group but did not achieve statistical significance (p=0.19, 95% confidence interval for relative risk G:P=.91-1.64). Although cancer <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> trended higher in the gemfibrozil group (p=0.11), cancers (excluding basal cell carcinoma) were diagnosed with equal frequency in both study groups. Due to the limited size of the study, the relative risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> from any cause was not shown to be different than that seen in the 9 year follow-up data from World Health Organization study (RR=1.29). Similarly, the numerical excess of gallbladder surgeries in the gemfibrozil group did not differ statistically from that observed in the WHO study.</p>
<p>A secondary prevention component of the Helsinki Heart Study enrolled middle-aged men excluded from the primary prevention study because of known or suspected coronary heart disease. Subjects received gemfibrozil or placebo for 5 years. Although cardiac <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> trended higher in the gemfibrozil group, this was not statistically significant (hazard ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval: 0.94-5.05). The rate of gallbladder surgery was not statistically significant between study groups, but did trend higher in the gemfibrozil group, (1.9% vs. 0.3%, p=0.07). There was a statistically significant difference in the number of appendectomies in the gemfibrozil group (6/311 vs. 0/317, p=0.029).</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">In a 24-month study in rats (10, 45, and 200 mg/kg; 0.3, 1, and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose on the basis of mg/meter<span class="Sup">2</span> of surface area), the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201519" conceptname="Primary malignant neoplasm of liver">liver carcinoma</span> was significantly increased at 6 times the maximum recommended human dose in males and females. A statistically significant increase in pancreatic carcinomas occurred in males at 1 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose; there were also increases in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4243445" conceptname="Benign neoplasm of pancreas">pancreatic adenomas</span> and benign testicular interstitial cell tumors at 6 times the maximum recommended human dose in males. In a second 24-month study in a different <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span> of rats (doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg; 0.3 and 2 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/meter<span class="Sup">2</span> surface area), there were significant increases in the incidence of pancreatic acinar <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> in both sexes and increases in interstitial cell tumors of the testes at 2 times the maximum recommended human dose.</p>
<p>A comparative carcinogenicity study was done in rats comparing three drugs: fenofibrate (10 and 70 mg/kg; 0.3 and 1.6 times the maximum recommended human dose), clofibrate (400 mg/kg; 1.6 times the human dose), and gemfibrozil (250 mg/kg; 1.7 times the human dose) (multiples based on mg/meter<span class="Sup">2</span> surface area). Pancreatic acinar <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> were increased in males and females on fenofibrate; hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic acinar <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> were increased in males and hepatic neoplastic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4101098" conceptname="Nodule">nodules</span> in females treated with clofibrate; hepatic neoplastic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4101098" conceptname="Nodule">nodules</span> were increased in males and females treated with gemfibrozil while testicular interstitial cell tumors were increased in males on all three drugs.</p>
<p>In a 21-month study in mice at doses of 10, 45, and 200 mg/kg (approximately 0.2, 0.7 and 3 times the maximum recommended human dose on the basis of mg/meter<span class="Sup">2</span> surface area), there were statistically significant increases in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201519" conceptname="Primary malignant neoplasm of liver">liver carcinoma</span> at 3 times the maximum recommended human dose in both males and females. In a second 18-month study at the same doses, there was a significant increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201519" conceptname="Primary malignant neoplasm of liver">liver carcinoma</span> in male mice and liver <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenoma</span> in female mice at 3 times the maximum recommended human dose.</p>
<p>Electron microscopy studies have demonstrated peroxisomal proliferation following fenofibrate administration to the rat. An adequate study to test for peroxisome proliferation in humans has not been done, but changes in peroxisome morphology and numbers have been observed in humans after treatment with other members of the fibrate class when liver biopsies were compared before and after treatment in the same individual.</p>
<p>Fenofibrate has been demonstrated to be devoid of mutagenic potential in the following tests: Ames, mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span>, chromosomal aberration, and unscheduled DNA synthesis.</p>

<h2>Pregnancy Category C</h2>
<p class="First">Fenofibrate has been shown to be embryocidal and teratogenic in rats when given in doses 7 to 10 times the maximum recommended human dose and embryocidal in rabbits when given at 9 times the maximum recommended human dose (on the basis of mg/meter<span class="Sup">2</span> surface area). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Fenofibrate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<p>Administration of 9 times the maximum recommended human dose of fenofibrate to female rats before and throughout gestation caused 100% of dams to delay delivery and resulted in a 60% increase in post-implantation loss, a decrease in litter size, a decrease in birth weight, a 40% survival of pups at birth, a 4% survival of pups as neonates, and a 0% survival of pups to weaning, and an increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4283381" conceptname="Spina bifida">spina bifida</span>.</p>
<p>Administration of 10 times the maximum recommended human dose to female rats on days 6-15 of gestation caused an increase in gross, visceral and skeletal findings in fetuses (domed head/hunched shoulders/rounded body/abnormal chest, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75351" conceptname="Adolescent postural kyphosis">kyphosis</span>, stunted fetuses, elongated sternal ribs, malformed sternebrae, extra foramen in palatine, misshapen vertebrae, supernumerary ribs).</p>
<p>Administration of 7 times the maximum recommended human dose to female rats from day 15 of gestation through weaning caused a delay in delivery, a 40% decrease in live births, a 75% decrease in neonatal survival, and decreases in pup weight, at birth as well as on days 4 and 21 post-partum.</p>
<p>Administration of 9 and 18 times the maximum recommended human dose to female rabbits caused abortions in 10% of dams at 9 times and 25% of dams at 18 times the maximum recommended human dose and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> of 7% of fetuses at 18 times the maximum recommended human dose.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">There is no specific treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> with Antara. General supportive care of the patient is indicated, including monitoring of vital signs and observation of clinical status, should an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> occur. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug should be achieved by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway. Because fenofibrate is highly bound to plasma proteins, hemodialysis should not be considered.</p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34068-7">
<a name="section-10"></a><p></p>
<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Patients should be placed on an appropriate lipid-lowering diet before receiving Antara, and should continue this diet during treatment with Antara. Antara capsules may be taken without regard to meals.</p>
<p>For the treatment of adult patients with primary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437827" conceptname="Pure hypercholesterolemia">hypercholesterolemia</span> or mixed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432867" conceptname="Hyperlipidemia">hyperlipidemia</span>, the initial dose of Antara is 130 mg per day.</p>
<p>For adult patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440360" conceptname="Pure hyperglyceridemia">hypertriglyceridemia</span>, the initial dose is 43 to 130 mg per day. Dosage should be individualized according to patient response, and should be adjusted if necessary following repeat lipid determinations at 4 to 8 week intervals. The maximum dose is 130 mg per day.</p>
<p>Treatment with Antara should be initiated at a dose of 43 mg/day in patients having <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>, and increased only after evaluation of the effects on renal function and lipid levels at this dose. In the elderly, the initial dose should likewise be limited to 43 mg/day.</p>
<p>Lipid levels should be monitored periodically and consideration should be given to reducing the dosage of Antara if lipid levels <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> significantly below the targeted range.</p>
