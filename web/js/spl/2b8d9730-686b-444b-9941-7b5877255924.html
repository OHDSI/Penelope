<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">LEVEMIR<span class="Sup">® </span>(insulin detemir [rDNA origin] injection) is a sterile solution of insulin detemir for use as an injection. Insulin detemir is a long-acting basal insulin analog, with up to 24 hours duration of action, produced by a process that includes expression of recombinant DNA in <span class="Italics">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> followed by chemical modification.</p>
<p>Insulin detemir differs from human insulin in that the amino acid threonine in position B30 has been omitted, and a C14 fatty acid chain has been attached to the amino acid B29. Insulin detemir has a molecular formula of C<span class="Sub">26</span><span class="Sub">7</span>H<span class="Sub">402</span>O<span class="Sub">76</span>N<span class="Sub">64</span>S<span class="Sub">6</span> and a molecular weight of 5916.9. It has the following structure:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="Figure of chemical structure" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=2b8d9730-686b-444b-9941-7b5877255924&amp;name=508a5c51-862e-43ac-84a4-31c5adfd5ec3-01.jpg"></div>
<p>LEVEMIR is a clear, colorless, aqueous, neutral sterile solution. Each milliliter of LEVEMIR contains 100 U (14.2 mg/mL) insulin detemir, 65.4 mcg zinc, 2.06 mg m-cresol, 16.0 mg glycerol, 1.80 mg phenol, 0.89 mg disodium phosphate dihydrate, 1.17 mg sodium chloride, and water for injection. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may be added to adjust pH. LEVEMIR has a pH of approximately 7.4.</p>

<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">The primary activity of insulin detemir is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulins, including insulin detemir, exert their specific action through binding to insulin receptors.</p>
<p>Receptor-bound insulin lowers blood glucose by facilitating cellular uptake of glucose into skeletal muscle and fat and by inhibiting the output of glucose from the liver. Insulin inhibits lipolysis in the adipocyte, inhibits proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis.</p>

<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">Insulin detemir is a soluble, long-acting basal human insulin analog with a relatively flat action profile. The mean duration of action of insulin detemir ranged from 5.7 hours at the lowest dose to 23.2 hours at the highest dose (sampling period 24 hours).</p>
<p>The prolonged action of LEVEMIR is mediated by the slow systemic absorption of insulin detemir molecules from the injection site due to strong self-association of the drug molecules and albumin binding. Insulin detemir is distributed more slowly to peripheral target tissues since insulin detemir in the bloodstream is highly bound to albumin.</p>

<p>For doses in the interval of 0.2 to 0.4 U/kg, LEVEMIR exerts more than 50% of its maximum effect from 3 to 4 hours up to approximately 14 hours after dose administration.</p>
<p>In a glucose clamp study, the overall glucodynamic effect (AUC<span class="Sub">GIR 0-24h</span>) [mean mg/kg ± SD (CV)] of four separate subcutaneous injections in the thigh was 1702.6 ± 489 mg/kg (29%) in the LEVEMIR group and 1922.8 ± 765 mg/kg (40%) for NPH. The clinical significance of this difference has not been established.</p>

<h3>Absorption</h3>
<p class="First">After subcutaneous injection of insulin detemir in healthy subjects and in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, insulin detemir serum concentrations indicated a slower, more prolonged absorption over 24 hours in comparison to NPH human insulin.</p>
<p>Maximum serum concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) is reached between 6 and 8 hours after administration.</p>
<p>The absolute bioavailability of insulin detemir is approximately 60%.</p>

<h3>Distribution and Elimination</h3>
<p class="First">More than 98% insulin detemir in the bloodstream is bound to albumin. LEVEMIR has a small apparent volume of distribution of approximately 0.1 L/kg. LEVEMIR, after subcutaneous administration, has a terminal half-life of 5 to7 hours depending on dose.</p>

<h3>Special Populations</h3>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Children and Adolescents</span>- The pharmacokinetic properties of LEVEMIR were investigated in children (6 to 12 years) and adolescents (13 to 17 years) and adults with type 1 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>. Similar to NPH human insulin, slightly higher plasma Area Under the Curve (AUC) and C<span class="Sub">max</span> were observed in children by 10% and 24%, respectively, compared to adolescents and adults. There was no difference in pharmacokinetics between adolescents and adults.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Geriatrics</span>- In a clinical trial investigating differences in pharmacokinetics of a single subcutaneous dose of LEVEMIR in young (25 to 35 years) versus elderly (≥68 years) healthy subjects, higher insulin AUC levels (up to 35%) were found in elderly subjects due to a reduced clearance. As with other insulin preparations, LEVEMIR should always be titrated according to individual requirements.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Gender</span>- In controlled clinical trials, no clinically relevant difference between genders is seen in pharmacokinetic parameters based on subgroup analyses.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Race</span>- In two trials in healthy Japanese and Caucasian subjects, there were no clinically relevant differences seen in pharmacokinetic parameters. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of LEVEMIR were investigated in a clamp trial comparing patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> of Caucasian, African-American, and Latino origin. Dose-response relationships were comparable for LEVEMIR in these three populations.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal impairment</span></span>- Individuals with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters as compared to healthy volunteers. However, literature reports have shown that clearance of human insulin is decreased in renally impaired patients. Careful glucose monitoring and dose adjustments of insulin, including LEVEMIR, may be necessary in patients with renal dysfunction (see PRECAUTIONS, <a href="#i4i_section_id_4c257e2d-f9da-4cd9-a98d-e83e45fb241e"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal Impairment</span></a>).</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic impairment</span></span>- Individuals with severe hepatic dysfunction, without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, were observed to have lower AUCs as compared to healthy volunteers. Careful glucose monitoring and dose adjustments of insulin, including LEVEMIR, may be necessary in patients with hepatic dysfunction (see PRECAUTIONS, <a href="#i4i_section_id_4339b78e-4d40-4e74-b03d-b65c7e6b5076"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic Impairment</span></a>).</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Pregnancy</span>- The effect of pregnancy on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of LEVEMIR has not been studied (see PRECAUTIONS, <a href="#i4i_pregnancy_id_ea162f2d-5941-4d25-8c43-5051a7c82cc2">Pregnancy </a>).</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Smoking</span>- The effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of LEVEMIR has not been studied.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First">The efficacy and safety of LEVEMIR given once-daily at bedtime or twice-daily (before breakfast and at bedtime, before breakfast and with the evening meal, or at 12-hour intervals) was compared to that of once-daily or twice-daily NPH human insulin or once-daily insulin glargine in non-blinded, randomized, parallel studies of 6004 patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> (3724 with type 1, and 2280 with type 2). In general, patients treated with LEVEMIR achieved levels of glycemic control similar to those treated with NPH human insulin or insulin glargine, as measured by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4123836" conceptname="Glycosylated hemoglobin">glycosylated hemoglobin</span> (HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span>).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Type 1 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">Diabetes</span> – Adult</span></p>
<p>In one non-blinded clinical study (Study A, n=409), adult patients with type 1 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> were randomized to treatment with either LEVEMIR at 12-hour intervals, LEVEMIR morning and bedtime or NPH human insulin morning and bedtime. Insulin aspart was also administered before each meal. At 16 weeks of treatment, the combined LEVEMIR-treated patients had similar HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) reductions to NPH-treated patients (Table 1). Differences in timing of LEVEMIR administration (or flexible dosing) had no effect on HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span>, FPG, body weight, or risk of having <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemic episodes</span>. </p>
<p>Overall glycemic control achieved with LEVEMIR was compared to that achieved with insulin glargine in a randomized, non-blinded, clinical study (Study B, n=320) in which patients with type 1 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> were treated for 26 weeks with either twice-daily (morning and bedtime) LEVEMIR or once-daily (bedtime) insulin glargine. Insulin aspart was administered before each meal. LEVEMIR-treated patients had a decrease in HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> similar to that of insulin glargine-treated patients.</p>
<p>In a randomized, controlled clinical study (Study C, n=749), patients with type 1 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> were treated with once-daily (bedtime) LEVEMIR or NPH human insulin, both in combination with human soluble insulin before each meal for 6 months. LEVEMIR and NPH human insulin had a similar effect on HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span>.</p>

Untreated hyperglycemic events are potentially fatal.</p>
<p>LEVEMIR is not intended for intravenous or intramuscular administration. The prolonged duration of activity of insulin detemir is dependent on injection into subcutaneous tissue. Intravenous administration of the usual subcutaneous dose could result in severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. Absorption after intramuscular administration is both faster and more extensive than absorption after subcutaneous administration.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">LEVEMIR should not be diluted or mixed with any other insulin preparations</span> (see PRECAUTIONS, <a href="#i4i_section_id_b6ddf7e2-3238-444e-8cfc-e19b1b9caf61">Mixing of Insulins</a>).</p>
<p>Insulin may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4190305" conceptname="Hypernatremia">sodium retention</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span>, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy.</p>

<p>As with all insulin preparations, the time course of LEVEMIR action may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and is dependent on site of injection, blood supply, temperature, and physical activity.</p>
<p>Adjustment of dosage of any insulin may be necessary if patients change their physical activity or their usual meal plan.</p>

<p class="First">As with all insulin preparations, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemic reactions</span> may be associated with the administration of LEVEMIR. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">Hypoglycemia</span> is the most common adverse effect of insulins. Early warning symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions, such as long duration of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, diabetic nerve disease, use of medications such as beta-blockers, or intensified <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> control (see PRECAUTIONS, <a href="#i4i_section_id_08b9cce6-c9a0-41d3-9fa7-5c55122f9555">Drug Interactions</a>).

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">LEVEMIR must only be used if the solution appears clear and colorless with no visible particles (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, <a href="#i4i_section_id_b896dba7-6849-4eb4-95e0-29c2eb5957d0">Preparation and Handling</a>). Patients should be informed about potential risks and advantages of LEVEMIR therapy, including the possible side effects.

Patients should be informed that frequent, patient-performed blood glucose measurements are needed to achieve effective glycemic control to avoid both <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. Patients must be instructed on handling of special situations such as intercurrent conditions (illness, stress, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4305081" conceptname="Emotional problems">emotional disturbances</span>), an inadequate or skipped insulin dose, inadvertent administration of an increased insulin dose, inadequate food intake, or skipped meals.

<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">As with all insulin therapy, the therapeutic response to LEVEMIR should be monitored by periodic blood glucose tests. Periodic measurement of HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> is recommended for the monitoring of long-term glycemic control.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require insulin dose adjustment and particularly close monitoring.</p>
<p>The following are examples of substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin: corticosteroids, danazol, diuretics, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., epinephrine, albuterol, terbutaline), isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, thyroid hormones, estrogens, progestogens (e.g., in oral contraceptives).</p>
<p>The following are examples of substances that may increase the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin and susceptibility to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>: oral antidiabetic drugs, ACE inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, MAO inhibitors, propoxyphene, salicylates, somatostatin analog (e.g., octreotide), and sulfonamide antibiotics.</p>
<p>Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>, which may sometimes be followed by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span>. In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine, the signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> may be reduced or absent.</p>
<p>The results of <span class="Italics">in-vitro </span>and <span class="Italics">in-vivo</span> protein binding studies demonstrate that there is no clinically relevant interaction between insulin detemir and fatty acids or other protein bound drugs.</p>

<h2>Mixing of Insulins</h2>
<p class="First">If LEVEMIR is mixed with other insulin preparations, the profile of action of one or both individual components may change. Mixing LEVEMIR with insulin aspart, a rapid acting insulin analog, resulted in about 40% reduction in AUC(<span class="Sub">0-2h</span>) and C<span class="Sub">max</span> for insulin aspart compared to separate injections when the ratio of insulin aspart to LEVEMIR was less than 50%.</p>

<h3>Teratogenic effects</h3>
<p class="First">In a fertility and embryonic development study, insulin detemir was administered to female rats before mating, during mating, and throughout pregnancy at doses up to 300 nmol/kg/day (3 times the recommended human dose, based on plasma Area Under the Curve (AUC) ratio). Doses of 150 and 300 nmol/kg/day produced numbers of litters with visceral anomalies. Doses up to 900 nmol/kg/day (approximately 135 times the recommended human dose based on AUC ratio) were given to rabbits during organogenesis. Drug-dose related increases in the incidence of fetuses with gall bladder abnormalities such as small, bilobed, bifurcated and missing gall bladders were observed at a dose of 900 nmol/kg/day. The rat and rabbit embryofetal development studies that included concurrent human insulin control groups indicated that insulin detemir and human insulin had similar effects regarding embryotoxicity and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span>.</p>

<h2>Nursing mothers</h2>
<p class="First">It is unknown whether LEVEMIR is excreted in significant amounts in human milk. For this reason, caution should be exercised when LEVEMIR is administered to a nursing mother. Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> who are lactating may require adjustments in insulin dose, meal plan, or both.</p>

<h2>Geriatric use</h2>
<p class="First">Of the total number of subjects in intermediate and long-term clinical studies of LEVEMIR, 85 (type 1 studies) and 363 (type 2 studies) were 65 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. In elderly patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, the initial dosing, dose increments, and maintenance dosage should be conservative to avoid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemic reactions</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">Hypoglycemia</span> may be difficult to recognize in the elderly.</p>

<p>In trials of up to 6 months duration in patients with type 1 and type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, the incidence of severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> with LEVEMIR was comparable to the incidence with NPH, and, as expected, greater overall in patients with type 1 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> (Table 4). </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">Weight gain</span>:</span></p>
<p>In trials of up to 6 months duration in patients with type 1 and type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, LEVEMIR was associated with somewhat less <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span> than NPH (Table 4). Whether these observed differences represent true differences in the effects of LEVEMIR and NPH insulin is not known, since these trials were not blinded and the protocols (e.g., diet and exercise instructions and monitoring) were not specifically directed at exploring hypotheses related to weight effects of the treatments compared. The clinical significance of the observed differences has not been established. </p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">LEVEMIR can be administered once- or twice-daily. The dose of LEVEMIR should be adjusted according to blood glucose measurements. The dosage of LEVEMIR should be individualized based on the physician’s advice, in accordance with the needs of the patient.</p>
<ul>
<li>For patients treated with Levemir once-daily, the dose should be administered with the evening meal or at bedtime.</li>
<li>For patients who require twice-daily dosing for effective blood glucose control, the evening dose can be administered either with the evening meal, at bedtime, or 12 hours after the morning dose.</li>
</ul>
<p>LEVEMIR should be administered by subcutaneous injection in the thigh, abdominal wall, or upper arm. Injection sites should be rotated within the same region. As with all insulins, the duration of action will vary according to the dose, injection site, blood flow, temperature, and level of physical activity.</p>

<h2>Dose Determination for LEVEMIR</h2>
<ul>
<li>For patients with type 1 or type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> on basal-bolus treatment, changing the basal insulin to LEVEMIR can be done on a unit-to-unit basis. The dose of LEVEMIR should then be adjusted to achieve glycemic targets. In some patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, more LEVEMIR may be required than NPH insulin. In a clinical study, the mean dose at end of treatment was 0.77 U/kg for LEVEMIR and 0.52 IU/kg for NPH human insulin (see Table 3).</li>
<li>For patients currently receiving only basal insulin, changing the basal insulin to LEVEMIR can be done on a unit-to-unit basis.</li>
<li>For insulin-naïve patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> who are inadequately controlled on oral antidiabetic drugs, LEVEMIR should be started at a dose of 0.1 to 0.2 U/kg once-daily in the evening or 10 units once- or twice-daily, and the dose adjusted to achieve glycemic targets. </li>
<li>As with all insulins, close glucose monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. Dose and timing of concurrent short-acting insulins or other concomitant antidiabetic treatment may need to be adjusted.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preparation and Handling</h2>
<p class="First">LEVEMIR should be inspected visually prior to administration and should only be used if the solution appears clear and colorless.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">LEVEMIR should not be mixed or diluted with any other insulin preparations.</span></p>
<p>After each injection, patients must<span class="Bold"> remove the needle without recapping</span> and dispose of it in a puncture-resistant container. Used syringes, needles, or lancets should be placed in “sharps? containers (such as red biohazard containers), hard plastic containers (such as detergent bottles), or metal containers (such as an empty coffee can).

<li>   At your first use, remove the tamper-resistant cap from the vial. If the cap has already been removed, do not use this vial and return it to your pharmacy.</li>
<li>Wipe the rubber membrane with an alcohol swab.</li>
<li> Do not roll or shake the vial. Vigorous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">shaking</span> right before the dose is drawn into the syringe may cause bubbles or froth, which could cause dosage errors. The insulin should be used only if it is clear and colorless.</li>
<li>Pull back the plunger on your syringe until the black tip reaches the marking for the number of units you will inject.</li>
<li>Push the needle through the rubber membrane into the vial.</li>
<li>Push the plunger all the way in. This inserts air into the vial.</li>
<li>Turn the vial and syringe upside down together and slowly pull the plunger back to a few units beyond the correct dose.</li>
<li>If there are air bubbles, tap the syringe gently with your finger to raise the air bubbles to the needle. Then slowly push the plunger to the correct unit marking.</li>
<li>Lift the vial off the syringe.</li>
<li>Inject right away.</li>
<li>The syringe and vial should be disposed of properly without recapping the needle. After each injection, patients must <span class="Bold">remove the needle without recapping</span> and dispose of it in a puncture-resistant container. Used syringes, needles, or lancets should be placed in sharps containers (such as red biohazard containers), hard plastic containers (such as detergent bottles), or metal containers (such as an empty coffee can). Such containers should be sealed and disposed of properly.<br>
</li>
</ol>
<span class="Bold"> Using the LEVEMIR 3 mL PenFill® cartridge in 3 mL PenFill® cartridge delivery devices* (*see 3 mL PenFill® cartridge compatible delivery devices section):</span><br><ol>

<li>Place the needle onto the 3 mL PenFill® cartridge compatible delivery device* immediately before use</li>
<li>Airshots should be done prior to each injection. Directions for performing an airshot and setting the dose are provided in your insulin delivery device instruction manual.</li>
<li>Discard needle after each dose. The needle should not be recapped to avoid needlesticks. After each injection, patients must <span class="Bold">remove the needle without recapping</span> and dispose of it in a puncture-resistant container. Used syringes, needles, or lancets should be placed in sharps containers (such as red biohazard containers), hard plastic containers (such as detergent bottles), or metal containers (such as an empty coffee can).

Hold the LEVEMIR InnoLet® in front of you and dial the dose selector clockwise to set the required dose. Do not put your hand over the push button when dialing the dose. If the button is not allowed to rise freely, insulin will be pushed out of the needle. You will hear a click for every single unit dialed. Do not rely on the clicking sound as a means for setting your dose. If you have set a wrong dose, simply dial the dose selector forward or backwards until the right number of dose has been set.<br><br><span class="Bold">50 units is the maximum dose.</span><br><br><span class="Bold">3.

Check that you have set the proper dose and depress the push button as far as it will go. Make sure not to block the dose selector while injecting, as the dose selector must be allowed to return to zero when you press the push button. When depressing the push button, you may hear a clicking sound. Do not rely on this clicking sound as a means of confirming delivery of your dose.<br>    After making the injection, unscrew the needle and discard appropriately. After each injection, you must <span class="Bold">remove the needle before replacing the device cap</span> and dispose of the needle in a puncture-resistant container.
