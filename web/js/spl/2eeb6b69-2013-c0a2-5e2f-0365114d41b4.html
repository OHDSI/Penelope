<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Albumin (Human) 25%, USP (Plasbumin<span class="Sup">Â®</span>-25) is made from large pools of human venous plasma by the Cohn <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">cold</span> ethanol fractionation process. Part of the fractionation may be performed by another licensed manufacturer. It is prepared in accordance with the applicable requirements established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>Plasbumin-25 is a 25% sterile solution of albumin in an aqueous diluent. The preparation is stabilized with 0.02 M sodium caprylate and 0.02 M acetyltryptophan. The aluminum content of the product is not more than 200 Âµg/L. The approximate sodium content of the product is 145 mEq/L. Plasbumin-25 is clear, slightly viscous, almost colorless to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260836" conceptname="Blanching of skin">pale</span> yellow, amber or green. It contains no preservative. Plasbumin-25 must be administered intravenously. </p>
<p>Each vial of Plasbumin-25 is heat-treated at 60Â°C for 10 hours against the possibility of transmitting the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> viruses.</p>
<p>Additionally, the manufacturing process was investigated for its capacity to decrease the infectivity of an experimental agent of transmissible spongiform <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372887" conceptname="Disorder of brain">encephalopathy</span> (TSE), considered as a model for the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agents.<a href="#sRef">(11-14)</a> The production steps from Pooled Plasma to Effluent IV-1 in the Plasbumin-25 manufacturing process have been shown to decrease TSE infectivity of that experimental model agent (a total of â‰¥7.0 logs). These studies provide reasonable assurance that low levels of vCJD/CJD agent infectivity, if present in the starting material, would be removed.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Each 20 mL vial of Plasbumin-25 supplies the oncotic equivalent of approximately 100 mL citrated plasma; 50 mL supplies the oncotic equivalent of approximately 250 mL citrated plasma.</p>
<p>When administered intravenously to an adequately hydrated subject, the oncotic (colloid osmotic) effect of 20 mL Plasbumin-25 is such that it will draw approximately a further 70 mL of fluid from the extravascular tissues into the circulation within 15 minutes,<a href="#sRef">(1)</a> thus increasing the total blood volume and reducing both hemoconcentration and whole blood viscosity. Accordingly, the main clinical indications are for hypoproteinemic states involving reduced oncotic pressure, with or without accompanying <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span>.<a href="#sRef">(2)</a> Plasbumin-25 can also be used as a plasma volume expander.</p>
<p>Albumin is a transport protein and it may be useful in severe hemolytic disease in the neonate who is awaiting exchange transfusion. The infused albumin may reduce the level of free bilirubin in the blood.<a href="#sRef">(2,3)</a> This could also be of importance in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4026032" conceptname="Acute hepatic failure">acute liver failure</span> where albumin might serve the dual role of supporting plasma oncotic pressure, as well as binding excessive plasma bilirubin.<a href="#sRef">(2)</a></p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Emergency Treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192647" conceptname="Hypovolemic shock">Hypovolemic Shock</span></span></p>
<p>Plasbumin-25 is hyperoncotic and on intravenous infusion will expand the plasma volume by an additional amount, three to four times the volume actually administered, by withdrawing fluid from the interstitial spaces, provided the patient is normally hydrated interstitially or there is interstitial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span>.<a href="#sRef">(1)</a> If the patient is dehydrated, additional crystalloids must be given,<a href="#sRef">(4)</a> or alternatively, Albumin (Human) 5%, USP (Plasbumin<span class="Sup">Â®</span>-5) should be used. The patientâ€™s hemodynamic response should be monitored and the usual precautions against circulatory overload observed. The total dose should not exceed the level of albumin found in the normal individual, i.e., about 2 g per kg body weight in the absence of active <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>. Although Plasbumin-5 is to be preferred for the usual volume deficits, Plasbumin-25 with appropriate crystalloids may offer therapeutic advantages in oncotic deficits or in long-standing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span> where treatment has been delayed.<a href="#sRef">(2)</a></p>
<p>Removal of ascitic fluid from a patient with cirrhosis may cause changes in cardiovascular function and even result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192647" conceptname="Hypovolemic shock">hypovolemic shock</span>. In such circumstances, the use of an albumin infusion may be required to support the blood volume.<a href="#sRef">(2)</a></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Burn Therapy</span></p>
<p>An optimal therapeutic regimen with respect to the administration of colloids, crystalloids, and water following <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022094" conceptname="Thermal burn">extensive burns</span> has not been established. During the first 24 hours after sustaining thermal injury, large volumes of crystalloids are infused to restore the depleted extracellular fluid volume. Beyond 24 hours Plasbumin-25 can be used to maintain plasma colloid osmotic pressure.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228222" conceptname="Hypoproteinemia">Hypoproteinemia</span> With or Without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">Edema</span></span></p>
<p>During major surgery, patients can lose over half of their circulating albumin with the attendant complications of oncotic deficit.<a href="#sRef">(2,4,5)</a> A similar situation can occur in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="132797" conceptname="Sepsis">sepsis</span> or intensive care patients. Treatment with Plasbumin-25 may be of value in such cases.<a href="#sRef">(2)</a></p>

<p>This is characterized by deficient oxygenation caused by pulmonary interstitial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span> complicating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span> and postsurgical conditions. When clinical signs are those of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228222" conceptname="Hypoproteinemia">hypoproteinemia</span> with a fluid volume overload, Plasbumin-25 together with a diuretic may play a role in therapy.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Cardiopulmonary Bypass<a href="#sRef">(2,6)</a></span></p>
<p>With the relatively small priming volume required with modern pumps, preoperative dilution of the blood using albumin and crystalloid has been shown to be safe and well-tolerated. Although the limit to which the hematocrit and plasma protein concentration can be safely lowered has not been defined, it is common practice to adjust the albumin and crystalloid pump prime to achieve a hematocrit of 20% and a plasma albumin concentration of 2.5 g per 100 mL in the patient.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4026032" conceptname="Acute hepatic failure">Acute Liver Failure</span><a href="#sRef">(2)</a></span></p>
<p>In the uncommon situation of rapid loss of liver function with or without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>, administration of albumin may serve the double purpose of supporting the colloid osmotic pressure of the plasma as well as binding excess plasma bilirubin.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Neonatal Hemolytic Disease<a href="#sRef">(2,3)</a></span></p>
<p>The administration of Plasbumin-25 may be indicated prior to exchange transfusion, in order to bind free bilirubin, thus lessening the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4326231" conceptname="Kernicterus">kernicterus</span>. A dosage of 1 g/kg body weight is given about 1 hour prior to exchange transfusion. Caution must be observed in hypervolemic infants.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Sequestration of Protein Rich Fluids<a href="#sRef">(7)</a></span></p>
<p>This occurs in such conditions as acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196152" conceptname="Peritonitis">peritonitis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192640" conceptname="Pancreatitis">pancreatitis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439045" conceptname="Mediastinitis">mediastinitis</span>, and extensive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435613" conceptname="Cellulitis">cellulitis</span>. The magnitude of loss into the third space may require treatment of reduced volume or oncotic activity with an infusion of albumin.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Erythrocyte Resuspension<a href="#sRef">(2)</a></span></p>
<p>Albumin may be required to avoid excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228222" conceptname="Hypoproteinemia">hypoproteinemia</span>, during certain types of exchange transfusion, or with the use of very large volumes of previously frozen or washed red cells. About 25 g of albumin per liter of erythrocytes is commonly used, although the requirements in preexistent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228222" conceptname="Hypoproteinemia">hypoproteinemia</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> can be greater. Plasbumin-25 is added to the isotonic suspension of washed red cells immediately prior to transfusion.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="195314" conceptname="Nephrotic syndrome">Nephrosis</span><a href="#sRef">(2)</a></span></p>
<p>Certain patients may not respond to cyclophosphamide or steroid therapy. The steroids may even aggravate the underlying <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span>. In this situation a loop diuretic and 100 mL Plasbumin-25 repeated daily for 7 to 10 days may be helpful in controlling the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span> and the patient may then respond to steroid treatment.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Renal Dialysis<a href="#sRef">(2)</a></span></p>
<p>Although not part of the regular regimen of renal dialysis, Plasbumin-25 may be of value in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> in these patients. The usual volume administered is about 100 mL, taking particular care to avoid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434004" conceptname="Hypervolemia">fluid overload</span> as these patients are often fluid overloaded and cannot tolerate substantial volumes of salt solution.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Plasbumin-25 is made from human plasma. Products made from human plasma may contain infectious agents, such as viruses, and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) agent that can cause disease. The theoretical risk for transmission of CJD is considered extremely remote. No cases of transmission of viral diseases or CJD have ever <span class="Bold">been identified for albumin. The risk that such products will transmit an infectious agent has been reduced by screening plasma donors for prior exposure to certain viruses, by testing for the presence of certain current virus <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span>, and by inactivating and/or removing certain viruses. Despite these measures, such products can still potentially transmit disease. There is also the possibility that unknown infectious agents may be present in such products. Individuals who receive infusions of blood or plasma products may develop signs and/or symptoms of some <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440029" conceptname="Viral disease">viral infections</span>, particularly <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> C. ALL <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> thought by a physician possibly to have been transmitted by this product should be reported by the physician or other healthcare provider to Grifols Therapeutics Inc. [1-800-520-2807].</span></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">The physician should discuss the risks and benefits of this product with the patient, before prescribing or administering it to the patient.</span></p>
<p>As with any hyperoncotic protein solution likely to be administered in large volumes, severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126829" conceptname="Hemolysis">hemolysis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span> may result from the inappropriate use of Sterile Water for Injection as a diluent for Albumin (Human), 25%. Acceptable diluents include 0.9% Sodium Chloride or 5% Dextrose in Water. Please refer to theÂ <span class="Bold"><a href="#sDoA">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>Â section for recommended diluents.</p>
<p>Solutions which have been frozen should not be used. Do not use if turbid. Do not begin administration more than 4 hours after the container has been entered. Partially used vials must be discarded. Vials which are cracked or which have been previously entered or damaged should not be used, as this may have allowed the entry of microorganisms.
