<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">CLOBEX<span class="Sup">®</span> (clobetasol propionate) Lotion, 
0.05% contains clobetasol propionate, a synthetic fluorinated corticosteroid, 
for topical dermatologic use. The corticosteroids constitute a class of 
primarily synthetic steroids used topically as anti-inflammatory and 
antipruritic agents.</p>
<p>Clobetasol propionate is 
21-chloro-9-fluoro-11β,17-dihydroxy-16β-methylpregna-1,4-diene-3, 
20-dione17-propionate, with the empirical formula C<span class="Sub">25</span>H<span class="Sub">32</span>CIFO<span class="Sub">5</span>, a 
molecular weight of 466.98 (CAS Registry Number 25122-46-7).</p>
<p>The following is the chemical structure:</p>
<p><img alt="image of chemical structure" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=a086ead1-b906-4198-af19-5423957c9e2a&amp;name=chemical%20structure.jpg"></p>
<p>Clobetasol propionate is a white to practically-white crystalline powder 
insoluble in water.</p>
<p>Each gram of CLOBEX<span class="Sup">®</span> (clobetasol propionate) Lotion, 
0.05% contains 0.5 mg of clobetasol propionate, in a vehicle base composed of 
hypromellose, propylene glycol, mineral oil, polyoxyethylene glycol 300 
isostearate, carbomer 1342, sodium hydroxide and purified water.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Like other topical corticosteroids, CLOBEX<span class="Sup">®</span> (clobetasol propionate) Lotion, 0.05% has anti-inflammatory, 
antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the 
anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids in general is unclear. 
However, corticosteroids are thought to act by induction of phospholipase A<span class="Sub">2</span> inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is 
postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release 
of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from 
membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A<span class="Sub">2</span>.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pharmacokinetics<p>The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids 
is determined by many factors, including the vehicle, the integrity of the 
epidermal barrier and occlusion. For example, occlusive dressing with 
hydrocortisone for up to 24 hours has not been demonstrated to increase 
penetration; however, occlusion of hydrocortisone for 96 hours markedly enhances 
penetration. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">Inflammation</span> and other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous 
absorption.</p>
<p>There are no human data regarding the distribution of corticosteroids to body 
organs following topical application. Nevertheless, once absorbed through the 
skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways 
similar to systematically administered corticosteroids. Due to the fact that 
circulating levels are usually below the level of detection, the use of 
pharmacodynamic endpoints for assessing the systemic exposure of topical 
corticosteroids is necessary. They are metabolized, primarily in the liver, and 
are then excreted by the kidneys. In addition, some corticosteroids and their 
metabolites are also excreted in the bile.</p>
<p>CLOBEX<span class="Sup">®</span> (clobetasol propionate) Lotion, 0.05% is in 
the super-high range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids 
in vasoconstrictor studies.</p>
<p>In studies evaluating the potential for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) 
axis suppression, CLOBEX<span class="Sup">®</span> Lotion, 0.05% demonstrated 
rates of suppression that were numerically higher than those of a clobetasol 
propionate 0.05% cream (Temovate E<span class="Sup">®</span> Emollient, 0.05%), 
(See <a href="#SPLSERV-6B9D2DF3-91DC-4D48-7BA4-9736A6A03105">PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">CLOBEX<span class="Sup">®</span> (clobetasol propionate) Lotion, 
0.05% is a super-high potent corticosteroid formulation indicated for the relief 
of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive 
dermatoses only in patients 18 years of age or older (see <a href="#SPLSERV-6B9D2DF3-91DC-4D48-7BA4-9736A6A03105">PRECAUTIONS</a>). Treatment 
should be limited to 2 consecutive weeks. The total dosage should not exceed 50 
g (50 mL or 1.75 fl.oz.) per week.</p>
<p>For the treatment of moderate to severe plaque <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span>, localized lesions 
(less than 10% body surface area) that have not sufficiently improved after the 
initial 2-week treatment with CLOBEX<span class="Sup">®</span> (clobetasol 
propionate) Lotion, 0.05% may be treated for up to 2 additional weeks. Any 
additional benefits of extending treatment should be weighed against the risk of 
HPA axis suppression before prescribing for more than 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Patients should be instructed to use CLOBEX<span class="Sup">®</span> 
(clobetasol propionate) Lotion, 0.05% for the minimum amount of time necessary 
to achieve the desired results (see <a href="#SPLSERV-6B9D2DF3-91DC-4D48-7BA4-9736A6A03105">PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>
<p>Use in patients younger than 18 years of age is not recommended due to 
numerically high rates of HPA axis suppression (see <a href="#SPLSERV-6B9D2DF3-91DC-4D48-7BA4-9736A6A03105">PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric 
Use</a>).</p>

<h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h1>
<p class="First">CLOBEX<span class="Sup">®</span> (clobetasol propionate) Lotion, 
0.05% is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to clobetasol 
propionate, to other corticosteroids, or to any ingredient in this 
preparation.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42232-9">

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<a href="http://"></a>General<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clobetasol propionate is a highly potent topical 
corticosteroid that has been shown to suppress the HPA axis at the lowest doses 
tested.</span></p>
<p>Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has caused reversible adrenal 
suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after 
withdrawal of treatment. Manifestations of Cushing’s syndrome, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span>, 
and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of 
topical corticosteroids while on treatment.</p>
<p>Conditions which increase systemic absorption include the application of the 
more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the 
addition of occlusive dressings. Therefore, patients applying a topical steroid 
to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated 
periodically for evidence of adrenal suppression (see <a href="#SPLSERV-E40CF491-A866-0687-C294-34C63D9EF4B5">laboratory tests</a> 
below). If adrenal suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw 
the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent 
steroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation 
of topical corticosteroids. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of 
glucocorticosteroid insufficiency may occur requiring supplemental systemic 
corticosteroids. For information on systemic supplementation, see prescribing 
information for those products.</p>
<p>The effect of CLOBEX<span class="Sup">®</span> Lotion, 0.05% on HPA axis 
function was compared to clobetasol propionate cream 0.05% (Temovate E® 
Emollient, 0.05%) in adults in two studies, one for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span> and one for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4019380" conceptname="Atopy">atopic</span> 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133835" conceptname="Eczema">dermatitis</span>. In total, 8 of 10 evaluable patients with moderate to severe plaque 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span> experienced adrenal suppression following 4 weeks of CLOBEX<span class="Sup">®</span> Lotion, 0.05% therapy (treatment beyond 4 consecutive weeks 
is not recommended in moderate to severe plaque <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span>). In follow-up 
testing, 1 of 2 patients remained suppressed after 8 days. In this comparative 
study, for clobetasol propionate cream, 0.05% there were 3 of 10 evaluable 
patients with HPA axis suppression. Furthermore, 5 of 9 evaluable patients with 
moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133834" conceptname="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</span> experienced adrenal suppression following 2 
weeks of CLOBEX<span class="Sup">®</span> Lotion, 0.05% therapy (treatment beyond 
2 consecutive weeks is not recommended in moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133834" conceptname="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</span>). 
Of the 3 patients that had follow-up testing, one patient failed to recover 
adrenal function 7 days post-treatment. For patients treated with clobetasol 
propionate cream, 0.05%, 4 of 9 evaluable patients experienced adrenal 
suppression following 2 weeks of treatment. Of the 2 patients that had follow-up 
testing, both recovered adrenal function 7 days post-treatment. The proportion 
of subjects suppressed may be underestimated because the adrenal glands were 
stimulated weekly with cosyntropin in these studies.</p>
<p>The potential increase in systemic exposure does not correlate with any 
proven benefit, but may lead to an increased potential for 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. Patients with acute 
illness or injury may have increased morbidity and mortality with intermittent 
HPA axis suppression. Patients should be instructed to use CLOBEX<span class="Sup">®</span> Lotion, 0.05% for the minimum amount of time necessary to 
achieve the desired results (See <a href="#SPLSERV-1CF0CD3E-69FC-4506-19D8-FD9D274F48D2">INDICATIONS AND 
USAGE</a>).</p>
<p>If irritation develops, CLOBEX<span class="Sup">®</span> Lotion, 0.05% should 
be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134438" conceptname="Contact dermatitis">Allergic contact dermatitis</span> 
with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather 
than noting a clinical exacerbation, as with most topical products not 
containing corticosteroids.</p>
<p>In the presence of dermatological <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span>, the use of an appropriate 
antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response 
does not occur promptly, use of CLOBEX<span class="Sup">®</span> Lotion, 0.05% 
should be discontinued until the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> has been adequately controlled.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">CLOBEX<span class="Sup">®</span> Lotion, 0.05% should not be

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Nursing Mothers<p>Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk 
and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, 
or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration 
of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce 
detectable quanitities in breast milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human 
milk, caution should be exercised when CLOBEX<span class="Sup">®</span> Lotion, 
0.05% is administered to a nursing woman.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pediatric Use<p>Use of CLOBEX<span class="Sup">®</span> Lotion, 0.05% in pediatric

<a href="#SPLSERV-6B9D2DF3-91DC-4D48-7BA4-9736A6A03105">PRECAUTIONS: 
General</a>).</p>
<p>The HPA axis suppression potential of CLOBEX<span class="Sup">®</span> Lotion, 
0.05% has been studied in adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) with moderate to 
severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133834" conceptname="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</span> covering a minimum of 20% of the total body surface 
area. In total 14 patients were evaluated for HPA axis function. Patients were 
treated twice daily for 2 weeks with CLOBEX<span class="Sup">®</span> Lotion, 
0.05%. After 2 weeks of treatment, 9 out of 14 of the patients experienced 
adrenal suppression. One out of 4 patients treated with CLOBEX<span class="Sup">®</span> Lotion, 0.05% who were retested remained suppressed two weeks 
post-treatment. In comparison, 2 of 10 of the patients treated with clobetasol 
propionate cream, 0.05% demonstrated HPA axis suppression. One patient who was 
retested recovered.</p>
<p>None of the patients who developed HPA axis suppression had concomitant 
clinical signs of adrenal suppression and none of them was discontinued from the 
study for reasons related to the safety or tolerability of CLOBEX<span class="Sup">®</span> Lotion, 0.05%. However patients with acute illness or injury 
may have increased morbidity and mortality with intermittent HPA axis 
suppression.</p>
<p>Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span>, pediatric 
patients are at a greater risk than adults of HPA axis suppression and Cushing’s

general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be made with caution, 
usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Topically applied CLOBEX<span class="Sup">®</span> (clobetasol 
propionate) Lotion, 0.05% can be absorbed in sufficient amount to produce 
systemic effects. (See <a href="#SPLSERV-6B9D2DF3-91DC-4D48-7BA4-9736A6A03105">PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34068-7">
<a name="section-9"></a><p></p>
<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">CLOBEX<span class="Sup">®</span> Lotion, 0.05% should be applied to 
the affected skin areas twice daily and rubbed in gently and completely. (See <a href="#SPLSERV-1CF0CD3E-69FC-4506-19D8-FD9D274F48D2">INDICATIONS AND 
USAGE</a>.)</p>
<p><span class="Bold">CLOBEX<span class="Sup">®</span> Lotion, 0.05% contains a 
super-high potent topical corticosteroid; therefore treatment should be limited 
to:</span></p>
<ul><li><span class="Bold">2 consecutive weeks for the relief of the inflammatory and 
pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses,</span></li></ul>
<ul><li><span class="Bold">and up to 2 additional weeks in very localized lesions of 
moderate to severe plaque <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span> (no more than 10% body surface area) that 
have not sufficiently improved after the initial 2 weeks of treatment with 
CLOBEX<span class="Sup">®</span> (clobetasol propionate) Lotion 0.05%.</span></li></ul>
<p>The total dosage should not exceed 50 g (50 mL or 1.75 fl. oz.) per week 
because of the potential for the drug to suppress the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.</p>
<p>Therapy should be discontinued when control has been achieved. If no 
improvement is seen within 2 weeks, reassessment of diagnosis may be 
necessary.</p>
<p>Use in pediatric patients younger than 18 years is not recommended because of 
numerically high rates of HPA axis suppression (See <a href="#SPLSERV-6B9D2DF3-91DC-4D48-7BA4-9736A6A03105">PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric 
Use</a>).</p>
<p>Unless directed by physician, CLOBEX<span class="Sup">®</span> Lotion, 0.05% 
should not be used with occlusive dressings.</p>
