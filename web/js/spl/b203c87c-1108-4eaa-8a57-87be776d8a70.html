<h1><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION
</span></h1>
<p class="First">Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets, USP contains hydrocodone (dihydrocodeinone) bitartrate, a semi synthetic centrally-acting opioid antitussive. Homatropine methylbromide is included in a subtherapeutic amount to discourage deliberate overdosage.</p>
<p>Each hydrocodone bitartrate and homatropine methylbromide tablets contains:</p>
<p>Hydrocodone Bitartrate, USP 5 mg</p>
<p>Homatropine Methylbromide, USP 1.5 mg.</p>
<p>Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets also contain: anhydrous lactose, dicalcium phosphate anhydrous, sodium starch glycolate, colloidal silicon dioxide and magnesium stearate.</p>
<p>The hydrocodone component is 4,5Î±-epoxy-3-methoxy-17-methylmorphinan -6-one-tartrate (1:1) hydrate (2:5), a fine white crystal or crystalline powder, which is derived from the opium alkaloid, thebaine, has a molecular weight of (494.50) and may be represented by the following structural formula:</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</span></h1>
<p class="First">Hydrocodone is a semisynthetic opioid antitussive and analgesic with multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of codeine. The precise mechanism of action of hydrocodone and other opiates is not known; however, hydrocodone is believed to act directly on the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> center. In excessive doses, hydrocodone like other opium derivatives, will depress respiration. The effects of hydrocodone in therapeutic doses on the cardiovascular system are insignificant. Hydrocodone can produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435279" conceptname="Tonic pupillary reaction">miosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142453" conceptname="Feeling high">euphoria</span>, physical and psychological <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>.</p>
<p>Following a 10 mg oral dose of hydrocodone administered to five adult male subjects, the mean peak concentration was 23.6 Â± 5.2 ng/ml.Â  Maximum serum levels were achieved at 1.3Â± 0.3 hours and the half-life was determined to be 3.8 Â± 0.3 hours. Hydrocodone exhibits a complex pattern of metabolism including 0-demethylation, N-demethylation and 6-keto reduction to the corresponding 6-<span class="Bold">Î±</span> and 6-<span class="Bold">Î²</span>-hydroxymetabolites.</p>

The ingestion of very large amounts of hydrocodone bitartrate and homatropine methylbromide tablets may, in addition, result in acute homatropine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Treatment:</span></p>
<p>Primary attention should be given to the reestablishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and the institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. The opioids antagonist naloxone hydrochloride is a specific antidote for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> which may result from overdosage or unusual sensitivity to opioids including hydrocodone. Therefore, an appropriate dose of naloxone hydrochloride should be administered, preferably by the intravenous route, simultaneously with efforts at respiratory resuscitation. For further information, see full prescribing information for naloxone hydrochloride. An antagonist should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>. Oxygen, intravenous fluids, vasopressors and other supportive measures should be employed as indicated. Gastric emptying may be useful in removing unabsorbed drug.</p>
