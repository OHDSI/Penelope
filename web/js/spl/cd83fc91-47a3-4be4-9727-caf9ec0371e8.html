<h1><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span></h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pharmacodynamics</span></p>
<p>Ritalin is a mild central nervous system stimulant.</p>
<p>The mode of action in man is not completely understood, but Ritalin presumably activates the brain stem arousal system and cortex to produce its stimulant effect.</p>
<p>There is neither specific evidence which clearly establishes the mechanism whereby Ritalin produces its mental and behavioral effects in children, nor conclusive evidence regarding how these effects relate to the condition of the central nervous system.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Effects on QT Interval</span></p>
<p>The effect of Focalin<span class="Sup">®</span> XR (dexmethylphenidate, the pharmacologically active <span class="Italics">d-</span>enantiomer of Ritalin) on the QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo- and open label active (moxifloxacin)-controlled study following single doses of Focalin<span class="Sup">®</span> XR 40mg in 75 healthy volunteers. ECGs were collected up to 12 h post-dose. Frederica’s method for heart rate correction was employed to derive the corrected QT interval (QTcF). The maximum mean prolongation of QTcF intervals was &lt;5 ms, and the upper limit of the 90% confidence interval was below 10 ms for all time matched comparisons versus placebo. This was below the threshold of clinical concern and there was no evident-exposure response relationship.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span></p>
<p>Ritalin in the SR tablets is more slowly but as extensively absorbed as in the regular tablets. Relative bioavailability of the SR tablet compared to the Ritalin tablet, measured by the urinary excretion of Ritalin major metabolite (α-phenyl-2-piperidine acetic acid) was 105% (49%-168%) in children and 101% (85%-152%) in adults. The time to peak rate in children was 4.7 hours (1.3-8.2 hours) for the SR tablets and 1.9 hours (0.3-4.4 hours) for the tablets.  An average of 67% of SR tablet dose was excreted in children as compared to 86% in adults.</p>
<p>In a clinical study involving adult subjects who received SR tablets, plasma concentrations of Ritalin’s major metabolite appeared to be greater in females than in males. No gender differences were observed for Ritalin plasma concentration in the same subjects.</p>

<p>Ritalin is indicated as an integral part of a total treatment program which typically includes other remedial measures (psychological, educational, social) for a stabilizing effect in children with a behavioral syndrome characterized by the following group of developmentally inappropriate symptoms: moderate-to-severe distractibility, short attention span, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">hyperactivity</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4078201" conceptname="Mood swings">emotional lability</span>, and impulsivity. The diagnosis of this syndrome should not be made with finality when these symptoms are only of comparatively recent origin. Nonlocalizing (soft) neurological signs, learning <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052648" conceptname="Disability">disability</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168553" conceptname="Electroencephalogram abnormal">abnormal EEG</span> may or may not be present, and a diagnosis of central nervous system dysfunction may or may not be warranted.</p>

<a name="section-4.2"></a><p></p>
<h2><span class="Bold">Special Diagnostic Considerations</span></h2>
<p class="First">Specific etiology of this syndrome is unknown, and there is no single diagnostic test. Adequate diagnosis requires the use not only of medical but of special psychological, educational, and social resources.</p>
<p>Characteristics commonly reported include: chronic history of short attention span, distractibility, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4078201" conceptname="Mood swings">emotional lability</span>, impulsivity, and moderate-to-severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">hyperactivity</span>; minor neurological signs and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168553" conceptname="Electroencephalogram abnormal">abnormal EEG</span>. Learning may or may not be impaired. The diagnosis must be based upon a complete history and evaluation of the child and not solely on the presence of one or more of these characteristics.</p>
<p>Drug treatment is not indicated for all children with this syndrome.  Stimulants are not intended for use in the child who exhibits symptoms secondary to environmental factors and/or primary psychiatric disorders, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychosis</span>. Appropriate educational placement is essential and psychosocial intervention is generally necessary. When remedial measures alone are insufficient, the decision to prescribe stimulant medication will depend upon the physician’s assessment of the chronicity and severity of the child’s symptoms.</p>

Published data are inadequate to determine whether chronic use of amphetamines may cause a similar suppression of growth, however, it is anticipated that they likely have this effect as well. Therefore, growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants, and patients who are not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted.</p>

<p>Methylphenidate may decrease the effectiveness of drugs used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>. Methylphenidate is metabolized primarily to ritalinic acid by de-esterification and not through oxidative pathways.</p>
<p>Human pharmacologic studies have shown that racemic methylphenidate may inhibit the metabolism of coumarin anticoagulants, anticonvulsants (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone), and tricyclic drugs (e.g., imipramine, clomipramine, desipramine). Downward dose adjustments of these drugs may be required when given concomitantly with methylphenidate. It may be necessary to adjust the dosage and monitor plasma drug concentration (or, in case of coumarin, coagulation times), when initiating or discontinuing methylphenidate.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis/Mutagenesis/Impairment of Fertility</span></h2>
<p class="First">In a lifetime carcinogenicity study carried out in B6C3F1 mice, methylphenidate caused an increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4301500" conceptname="Liver cell adenoma">hepatocellular adenomas</span> and, in males only, an increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4001172" conceptname="Hepatoblastoma">hepatoblastomas</span>, at a daily dose of approximately 60 mg/kg/day. This dose is approximately 30 times and 4 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/kg and mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, respectively. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4001172" conceptname="Hepatoblastoma">Hepatoblastoma</span> is a relatively rare rodent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197506" conceptname="Malignant neoplasm of abdomen">malignant tumor</span> type. There was no increase in total malignant hepatic tumors. The mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span> used is sensitive to the development of hepatic tumors, and the significance of these results to humans is unknown.</p>
<p>Methylphenidate did not cause any increases in tumors in a lifetime carcinogenicity study carried out in F344 rats; the highest dose used was approximately 45 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 22 times and 5 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/kg and mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, respectively.</p>
<p>In a 24-week carcinogenicity study in the transgenic mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span> p53+/-, which is sensitive to genotoxic carcinogens, there was no evidence of carcinogenicity. Male and female mice were fed diets containing the same concentration of methylphenidate as in the lifetime carcinogenicity study; the high-dose groups were exposed to 60-74 mg/kg/day of methylphenidate.</p>
<p>Methylphenidate was not mutagenic in the in vitro Ames reverse mutation assay or in the in vitro mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> cell forward mutation assay. Sister chromatid exchanges and chromosome aberrations were increased, indicative of a weak clastogenic response, in an in vitro assay in cultured Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. Methylphenidate was negative in vivo in males and females in the mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay.</p>
<p>Methlyphenidate did not impair fertility in male or female mice that were fed diets containing the drug in an 18-week Continuous Breeding study. The study was conducted at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day, approximately 80-fold and 8-fold the highest recommended dose on a mg/kg and mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, respectively.</p>

<p class="First">In studies conducted in rats and rabbits, methylphenidate was administered orally at doses of up to 75 and 200 mg/kg/day, respectively, during the period of organogenesis. Teratogenic effects (increased incidence of fetal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4283381" conceptname="Spina bifida">spina bifida</span>) were observed in rabbits at the highest dose, which is approximately 40 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. The no effect level for embryo-fetal development in rabbits was 60 mg/kg/day (11 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis). There was no evidence of specific teratogenic activity in rats, although increased incidences of fetal skeletal variations were seen at the highest dose level (7 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis), which was also maternally toxic. The no effect level for embryo-fetal development in rats was 25 mg/kg/day (2 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis). When methylphenidate was administered to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation at doses of up to 45 mg/kg/day, offspring body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span> was decreased at the highest dose (4 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis), but no other effects on postnatal development were observed.
