<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Mycophenolate mofetil is the 2-morpholinoethyl ester of mycophenolic acid (MPA), an immunosuppressive agent; inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor.</p>
<p>The chemical name for mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is 2-morpholinoethyl (E)-6-(1,3-dihydro-4-hydroxy-6-methoxy-7-methyl-3-oxo-5-isobenzofuranyl)-4-methyl-4-hexenoate. It has a molecular formula of C<span class="Sub">23</span>H<span class="Sub">31</span>NO<span class="Sub">7</span>, a molecular weight of 433.50, and the following structural formula:</p>

</div>
<p>Mycophenolate mofetil is a white to off-white crystalline powder. It is slightly soluble in water (43 mcg/mL at pH 7.4); the solubility increases in acidic medium (4.27 mg/mL at pH 3.6). It is freely soluble in acetone, soluble in methanol, and sparingly soluble in ethanol. The apparent partition coefficient in 1-octanol/water (pH 7.4) buffer solution is 238. The pKa values for mycophenolate mofetil are 5.6 for the morpholino group and 8.5 for the phenolic group.</p>
<p>Mycophenolate mofetil tablets are available for oral administration, as tablets contains 500 mg of mycophenolate mofetil. In addition, each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, talc, hypromellose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, polyethylene glycol, titanium dioxide, iron oxide black, and iron oxide red.</p>

<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Mycophenolate mofetil has been demonstrated in experimental animal models to prolong the survival of allogeneic transplants (kidney, heart, liver, intestine, limb, small bowel, pancreatic islets, and bone marrow).</p>
<p>Mycophenolate mofetil has also been shown to reverse ongoing acute rejection in the canine renal and rat cardiac allograft models. Mycophenolate mofetil also inhibited proliferative <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321882" conceptname="Generalized atherosclerosis">arteriopathy</span> in experimental models of aortic and cardiac allografts in rats, as well as in primate cardiac xenografts. Mycophenolate mofetil was used alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents in these studies. Mycophenolate mofetil has been demonstrated to inhibit immunologically mediated inflammatory responses in animal models and to inhibit tumor development and prolong survival in murine tumor transplant models.</p>
<p>Mycophenolate mofetil is rapidly absorbed following oral administration and hydrolyzed to form MPA, which is the active metabolite. MPA is a potent, selective, uncompetitive, and reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), and therefore inhibits the de novo pathway of guanosine nucleotide synthesis without incorporation into DNA. Because T- and B-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span> are critically dependent for their proliferation on de novo synthesis of purines, whereas other cell types can utilize salvage pathways, MPA has potent cytostatic effects on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span>. MPA inhibits proliferative responses of T- and B-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span> to both mitogenic and allospecific stimulation. Addition of guanosine or deoxyguanosine reverses the cytostatic effects of MPA on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span>. MPA also suppresses antibody formation by B-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span>. MPA prevents the glycosylation of lymphocyte and monocyte glycoproteins that are involved in intercellular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4175338" conceptname="Adhesion">adhesion</span> to endothelial cells and may inhibit recruitment of leukocytes into sites of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4248020" conceptname="Graft rejection">graft rejection</span>. Mycophenolate mofetil did not inhibit early events in the activation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, such as the production of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-2 (IL-2), but did block the coupling of these events to DNA synthesis and proliferation.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Following oral and intravenous administration, mycophenolate mofetil undergoes rapid and complete metabolism to MPA, the active metabolite. Oral absorption of the drug is rapid and essentially complete. MPA is metabolized to form the phenolic glucuronide of MPA (MPAG) which is not pharmacologically active. The parent drug, mycophenolate mofetil, can be measured systemically during the intravenous infusion; however, shortly (about 5 minutes) after the infusion is stopped or after oral administration, MMF concentration is below the limit of quantitation (0.4 mcg/mL).</p>
</div>

<h2><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></h2>
<p class="First">In 12 healthy volunteers, the mean absolute bioavailability of oral mycophenolate mofetil relative to intravenous mycophenolate mofetil (based on MPA AUC) was 94%. The area under the plasma-concentration time curve (AUC) for MPA appears to increase in a dose-proportional fashion in renal transplant patients receiving multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil up to a daily dose of 3 g (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#_Ref405898701">Table 1</a></span>).</p>
<p>Food (27 g fat, 650 calories) had no effect on the extent of absorption (MPA AUC) of mycophenolate mofetil when administered at doses of 1.5 g bid to renal transplant patients. However, MPA C<span class="Sub">max </span>was decreased by 40% in the presence of food (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_abuse_dependence_id_d8cb63c5-c9d4-4b12-b710-ae2a3a10936a">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>

<h2><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></h2>
<p class="First">The mean (±SD) apparent volume of distribution of MPA in 12 healthy volunteers is approximately 3.6 (±1.5) and 4 (±1.2) L/kg following intravenous and oral administration, respectively. MPA, at clinically relevant concentrations, is 97% bound to plasma albumin. MPAG is 82% bound to plasma albumin at MPAG concentration ranges that are normally seen in stable renal transplant patients; however, at higher MPAG concentrations (observed in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> or delayed renal graft function), the binding of MPA may be reduced as a result of competition between MPAG and MPA for protein binding. Mean blood to plasma ratio of radioactivity concentrations was approximately 0.6 indicating that MPA and MPAG do not extensively distribute into the cellular fractions of blood.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies to evaluate the effect of other agents on the binding of MPA to human serum albumin (HSA) or plasma proteins showed that salicylate (at 25 mg/dL with HSA) and MPAG (at ≥ 460 mcg/mL with plasma proteins) increased the free fraction of MPA. At concentrations that exceeded what is encountered clinically, cyclosporine, digoxin, naproxen, prednisone, propranolol, tacrolimus, theophylline, tolbutamide, and warfarin did not increase the free fraction of MPA. MPA at concentrations as high as 100 mcg/mL had little effect on the binding of warfarin, digoxin or propranolol, but decreased the binding of theophylline from 53% to 45% and phenytoin from 90% to 87%.</p>

<h2><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></h2>
<p class="First">Following oral and intravenous dosing, mycophenolate mofetil undergoes complete metabolism to MPA, the active metabolite. Metabolism to MPA occurs presystemically after oral dosing. MPA is metabolized principally by glucuronyl transferase to form the phenolic glucuronide of MPA (MPAG) which is not pharmacologically active.<span class="Italics"> In vivo</span>, MPAG is converted to MPA via enterohepatic recirculation. The following metabolites of the 2-hydroxyethyl-morpholino moiety are also recovered in the urine following oral administration of mycophenolate mofetil to healthy subjects: N-(2-carboxymethyl)-morpholine, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-morpholine, and the N-oxide of N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-morpholine.</p>
<p>Secondary peaks in the plasma MPA concentration-time profile are usually observed 6 to 12 hours postdose. The coadministration of cholestyramine (4 g tid) resulted in approximately a 40% decrease in the MPA AUC (largely as a consequence of lower concentrations in the terminal portion of the profile). These observations suggest that enterohepatic recirculation contributes to MPA plasma concentrations.</p>
<p>Increased plasma concentrations of mycophenolate mofetil metabolites (MPA 50% increase and MPAG about a 3-fold to 6-fold increase) are observed in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_section_id_63d9fa34-0621-4e9c-ae57-35e90a41128a">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations</a></span>).</p>

<h2><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></h2>
<p class="First">Negligible amount of drug is excreted as MPA (&lt; 1% of dose) in the urine. Orally administered radiolabeled mycophenolate mofetil resulted in complete recovery of the administered dose, with 93% of the administered dose recovered in the urine and 6% recovered in feces. Most (about 87%) of the administered dose is excreted in the urine as MPAG. At clinically encountered concentrations, MPA and MPAG are usually not removed by hemodialysis. However, at high MPAG plasma concentrations (&gt; 100 mcg/mL), small amounts of MPAG are removed. Bile acid sequestrants, such as cholestyramine, reduce MPA AUC by interfering with enterohepatic circulation of the drug (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_section_id_8bb358fa-eb7e-49b7-bfd3-4e7e054a7477">OVERDOSAGE</a></span>).</p>
<p>Mean (±SD) apparent half-life and plasma clearance of MPA are 17.9 (±6.5) hours and 193 (±48) mL/min following oral administration and 16.6 (±5.8) hours and 177 (±31) mL/min following intravenous administration, respectively.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics in Healthy Volunteers, Renal, Cardiac, and Hepatic Transplant Patients</span></p>
<p>Shown below are the mean (±SD) pharmacokinetic parameters for MPA following the administration of mycophenolate mofetil given as single doses to healthy volunteers and multiple doses to renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients. In the early posttransplant period (&lt; 40 days posttransplant), renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients had mean MPA AUCs approximately 20% to 41% lower and mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> approximately 32% to 44% lower compared to the late transplant period (3 to 6 months posttransplant).</p>
<p>Mean MPA AUC values following administration of 1 g bid intravenous mycophenolate mofetil over 2 hours to renal transplant patients for 5 days were about 24% higher than those observed after oral administration of a similar dose in the immediate posttransplant phase. In hepatic transplant patients, administration of 1 g bid intravenous mycophenolate mofetil followed by 1.5 g bid oral mycophenolate mofetil resulted in mean MPA AUC values similar to those found in renal transplant patients administered 1 g mycophenolate mofetil bid.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span></h2>
<p class="First">In a single-dose study, MMF was administered as capsule or intravenous infusion over 40 minutes. Plasma MPA AUC observed after oral dosing to volunteers with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196991" conceptname="Chronic renal impairment">chronic renal impairment</span> [glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 25 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>] was about 75% higher relative to that observed in healthy volunteers (GFR &gt; 80 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>). In addition, the single-dose plasma MPAG AUC was 3-fold to 6-fold higher in volunteers with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> than in volunteers with mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> or healthy volunteers, consistent with the known renal elimination of MPAG. No data are available on the safety of long-term exposure to this level of MPAG.</p>
<p>Plasma MPA AUC observed after single-dose (1 g) intravenous dosing to volunteers (n=4) with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196991" conceptname="Chronic renal impairment">chronic renal impairment</span> (GFR &lt; 25 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>) was 62.4 mcg•h/mL (±19.3). Multiple dosing of mycophenolate mofetil in patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196991" conceptname="Chronic renal impairment">chronic renal impairment</span> has not been studied (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID_3ecbbab9-27d5-4066-abe0-f7291b902153">PRECAUTIONS:  Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal Impairment</span></a></span>  and <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_abuse_dependence_id_d8cb63c5-c9d4-4b12-b710-ae2a3a10936a">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>
<p>In patients with delayed renal graft function posttransplant, mean MPA AUC<span class="Sub">(0-12h)</span> was comparable to that seen in posttransplant patients without delayed renal graft function. There is a potential for a transient increase in the free fraction and concentration of plasma MPA in patients with delayed renal graft function. However, dose adjustment does not appear to be necessary in patients with delayed renal graft function. Mean plasma MPAG AUC<span class="Sub">(0-12h)</span> was 2-fold to 3-fold higher than in posttransplant patients without delayed renal graft function (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID_3ecbbab9-27d5-4066-abe0-f7291b902153">PRECAUTIONS: Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal Impairment</span></a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_abuse_dependence_id_d8cb63c5-c9d4-4b12-b710-ae2a3a10936a">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>
<p>In 8 patients with primary graft non-function following renal transplantation, plasma concentrations of MPAG accumulated about 6-fold to 8-fold after multiple dosing for 28 days. Accumulation of MPA was about 1-fold to 2-fold.</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate mofetil are not altered by hemodialysis. Hemodialysis usually does not remove MPA or MPAG. At high concentrations of MPAG (&gt; 100 mcg/mL), hemodialysis removes only small amounts of MPAG.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">Hepatic Insufficiency</span></h2>

However, it should be noted that for unexplained reasons, the healthy volunteers in this study had about a 50% lower AUC as compared to healthy volunteers in other studies, thus making comparisons between volunteers with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196463" conceptname="Alcoholic cirrhosis">alcoholic cirrhosis</span> and healthy volunteers difficult. Effects of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span> on this process probably depend on the particular disease. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic disease</span> with other etiologies, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135822" conceptname="Primary biliary cirrhosis">primary biliary cirrhosis</span>, may show a different effect. In a single-dose (1 g intravenous) study of 6 volunteers with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> (aminopyrine breath test less than 0.2% of dose) due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196463" conceptname="Alcoholic cirrhosis">alcoholic cirrhosis</span>, MMF was rapidly converted to MPA.

<p>The mycophenolate mofetil oral suspension dose of 600 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> bid (up to a maximum of 1 g bid) achieved mean MPA AUC values in pediatric patients similar to those seen in adult renal transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil capsules at a dose of 1 g bid in the early posttransplant period. There was wide variability in the data. As observed in adults, early posttransplant MPA AUC values were approximately 45% to 53% lower than those observed in the later posttransplant period (&gt; 3 months). MPA AUC values were similar in the early and late posttransplant period across the 1 year to 18 year age range.</p>

<h2><span class="Italics">Adults</span></h2>
<p class="First">The three renal studies compared two dose levels of oral mycophenolate mofetil (1 g bid and 1.5 g bid) with azathioprine (2 studies) or placebo (1 study) when administered in combination with cyclosporine (Sandimmune<span class="Sup">®</span>) and corticosteroids to prevent acute rejection episodes. One study also included antithymocyte globulin (ATGAM<span class="Sup">®</span>) induction therapy. These studies are described by geographic location of the investigational sites. One study was conducted in the USA at 14 sites, one study was conducted in Europe at 20 sites, and one study was conducted in Europe, Canada, and Australia at a total of 21 sites.</p>
<p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients in each treatment group who experienced treatment failure within the first 6 months after transplantation (defined as biopsy-proven acute rejection on treatment or the occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>, graft loss or early termination from the study for any reason without prior biopsy-proven rejection). Mycophenolate mofetil, when administered with antithymocyte globulin (ATGAM<span class="Sup">®</span>) induction (one study) and with cyclosporine and corticosteroids (all three studies), was compared to the following three therapeutic regimens: (1) antithymocyte globulin (ATGAM<span class="Sup">®</span>) induction/azathioprine/cyclosporine/corticosteroids, (2) azathioprine/cyclosporine/corticosteroids, and (3) cyclosporine/corticosteroids.</p>
<p>Mycophenolate mofetil, in combination with corticosteroids and cyclosporine reduced (statistically significant at 0.05 level) the incidence of treatment failure within the first 6 months following transplantation. <span class="Bold"><a href="#_Ref405899114">Table 4</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#_Ref405899166">Table 5</a></span> summarize the results of these studies. These tables show (1) the proportion of patients experiencing treatment failure, (2) the proportion of patients who experienced biopsy-proven acute rejection on treatment, and (3) early termination, for any reason other than graft loss or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>, without a prior biopsy-proven acute rejection episode. Patients who prematurely discontinued treatment were followed for the occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> or graft loss, and the cumulative incidence of graft loss and patient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> are summarized separately. Patients who prematurely discontinued treatment were not followed for the occurrence of acute rejection after termination. More patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil discontinued without prior biopsy-proven rejection, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> or graft loss than discontinued in the control groups, with the highest rate in the mycophenolate mofetil 3 g/day group. Therefore, the acute rejection rates may be underestimates, particularly in the mycophenolate mofetil 3 g/day group.</p>

<h2>Pediatrics</h2>
<p class="First">One open-label, safety and pharmacokinetic study of mycophenolate mofetil oral suspension 600 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> bid (up to 1 g bid) in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids was performed at centers in the US (9), Europe (5) and Australia (1) in 100 pediatric patients (3 months to 18 years of age) for the prevention of renal allograft rejection. Mycophenolate mofetil was well tolerated in pediatric patients (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_adverse_effects_id_54cfa143-a6b6-4d2e-a3fc-94615190afe2">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span>), and the pharmacokinetics profile was similar to that seen in adult patients dosed with 1 g bid mycophenolate mofetil capsules (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_section_id_55fc4149-95e1-442d-bc4d-947fde83a97f">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics</a></span>). The rate of biopsy-proven rejection was similar across the age groups (3 months to &lt; 6 years, 6 years to &lt; 12 years, 12 years to 18 years). The overall biopsy-proven rejection rate at 6 months was comparable to adults. The combined incidence of graft loss (5%) and patient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> (2%) at 12 months posttransplant was similar to that observed in adult renal transplant patients.</p>

<h2>Hepatic Transplant</h2>
<p class="First">A double-blind, randomized, comparative, parallel-group, multicenter study in primary hepatic transplant recipients was performed at 16 centers in the United States, 2 in Canada, 4 in Europe and 1 in Australia. The total number of patients enrolled was 565. Per protocol, patients received mycophenolate mofetil 1 g bid intravenously for up to 14 days followed by mycophenolate mofetil 1.5 g bid orally or azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day intravenously followed by azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day orally, in combination with cyclosporine (Neoral<span class="Sup">®</span>) and corticosteroids as maintenance immunosuppressive therapy.

The two primary endpoints were: (1) the proportion of patients who experienced, in the first 6 months posttransplantation, one or more episodes of biopsy-proven and treated rejection or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> or retransplantation, and (2) the proportion of patients who experienced graft loss (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> or retransplantation) during the first 12 months posttransplantation. Patients who prematurely discontinued treatment were followed for the occurrence of allograft rejection and for the occurrence of graft loss (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> or retransplantation) for 1 year.</p>

<h2>Pregnancy Testing</h2>
<p class="First">To prevent unplanned exposure during pregnancy, females of reproductive potential should have a serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL immediately before starting mycophenolate mofetil. Another pregnancy test with the same sensitivity should be done 8 to 10 days later. Repeat pregnancy tests should be performed during routine follow-up visits. Results of all pregnancy tests should be discussed with the patient.</p>
<p>In the event of a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4094910" conceptname="Pregnancy test positive">positive pregnancy test</span>, females should be counseled with regard to whether the maternal benefits of mycophenolate treatment may outweigh the risks to the fetus in certain situations.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Drug interaction studies with mycophenolate mofetil have been conducted with acyclovir, antacids, cholestyramine, cyclosporine, ganciclovir, oral contraceptives, sevelamer, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin and metronidazole.

<h2>Acyclovir</h2>
<p class="First">Coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) and acyclovir (800 mg) to 12 healthy volunteers resulted in no significant change in MPA AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span>. However, MPAG and acyclovir plasma AUCs were increased 10.6% and 21.9%, respectively. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, as are acyclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate and acyclovir or its prodrug (eg, valacyclovir) to compete for tubular secretion, further increasing the concentrations of both drugs.</p>

<h2>Antacids With Magnesium and Aluminum Hydroxides</h2>
<p class="First">Absorption of a single dose of mycophenolate mofetil (2 g) was decreased when administered to ten <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> patients also taking Maalox<span class="Sup">® </span>TC (10 mL qid). The C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">(0-24h) </span>for MPA were 33% and 17% lower, respectively, than when mycophenolate mofetil was administered alone under fasting conditions. Mycophenolate mofetil may be administered to patients who are also taking antacids containing magnesium and aluminum hydroxides; however, it is recommended that mycophenolate mofetil and the antacid not be administered simultaneously.</p>

<h2>Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs)</h2>
<p class="First">Coadministration of PPIs (e.g., lansoprazole, pantoprazole) in single doses to healthy volunteers and multiple doses to transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil has been reported to reduce the exposure to mycophenolic acid (MPA). An approximate reduction of 30 to 70% in the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and 25% to 35% in the AUC of MPA has been observed, possibly due to a decrease in MPA solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical impact of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving PPIs and mycophenolate mofetil. Because clinical relevance has not been established, PPIs should be used with caution when coadministered to transplant patients being treated with mycophenolate mofetil.</p>

<h2>Cholestyramine</h2>
<p class="First">Following single-dose administration of 1.5 g mycophenolate mofetil to 12 healthy volunteers pretreated with 4 g tid of cholestyramine for 4 days, MPA AUC decreased approximately 40%. This decrease is consistent with interruption of enterohepatic recirculation which may be due to binding of recirculating MPAG with cholestyramine in the intestine. Some degree of enterohepatic recirculation is also anticipated following intravenous administration of mycophenolate mofetil. Therefore mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with cholestyramine or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation.</p>

<h2>Cyclosporine</h2>
<p class="First">Cyclosporine (Sandimmune<span class="Sup">®</span>) pharmacokinetics (at doses of 275 to 415 mg/day) were unaffected by single and multiple doses of 1.5 g bid of mycophenolate mofetil in 10 stable renal transplant patients. The mean (±SD) AUC<span class="Sub">(0-12h)</span> and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of cyclosporine after 14 days of multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil were 3290 (±822) ng•h/mL and 753 (±161) ng/mL, respectively, compared to 3245 (±1088) ng•h/mL and 700 (±246) ng/mL, respectively, 1 week before administration of mycophenolate mofetil. </p>
<p>In renal transplant patients, mean MPA exposure AUC<span class="Sub">(0-12h)</span> was approximately 30-50% greater when mycophenolate mofetil is administered without cyclosporine compared with when mycophenolate mofetil is coadministered with cyclosporine. This interaction is due to cyclosporine inhibition of multidrug-resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP-2) transporter in the biliary tract, thereby preventing the excretion of MPAG into the bile that would lead to enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. This information should be taken into consideration when MMF is used without cyclosporine.</p>

<h2>Ganciclovir</h2>
<p class="First">Following single-dose administration to 12 stable renal transplant patients, no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interaction</span> was observed between mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) and intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg). Mean (±SD) ganciclovir AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> (n=10) were 54.3 (±19) mcg•h/mL and 11.5 (±1.8) mcg/mL, respectively, after coadministration of the two drugs, compared to 51 (±17) mcg•h/mL and 10.6 (±2) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of intravenous ganciclovir alone. The mean (±SD) AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of MPA (n=12) after coadministration were 80.9 (±21.6) mcg•h/mL and 27.8 (±13.9) mcg/mL, respectively, compared to values of 80.3 (±16.4) mcg•h/mL and 30.9 (±11.2) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, as are ganciclovir concentrations, the two drugs will compete for tubular secretion and thus further increases in concentrations of both drugs may occur. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> in which MMF and ganciclovir or its prodrug (eg, valganciclovir) are coadministered, patients should be monitored carefully.</p>

<h2>Oral Contraceptives</h2>
<p class="First">A study of coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g bid) and combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.20 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) was conducted in 18 women with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span> over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles. Mean AUC<span class="Sub">(0-24h)</span> was similar for ethinylestradiol and 3-keto desogestrel; however, mean levonorgestrel AUC<span class="Sub">(0-24h)</span> significantly decreased by about 15%. There was large inter-patient variability (%CV in the range of 60% to 70%) in the data, especially for ethinylestradiol. Mean serum levels of LH, FSH and progesterone were not significantly affected. Mycophenolate mofetil may not have any influence on the ovulation-suppressing action of the studied oral contraceptives. It is recommended to coadminister mycophenolate mofetil with hormonal contraceptives (eg, birth control pill, transdermal patch, vaginal ring, injection, and implant) with caution and additional barrier contraceptive methods must be used (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID_345f07bd-827d-48ce-960a-52135d16952f">PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy Exposure Prevention and Planning</a></span>).</p>

<h2>Sevelamer</h2>
<p class="First">Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">(0-12h)</span> by 36% and 26% respectively. This data suggest that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders should not be administered simultaneously with mycophenolate mofetil. Alternatively, it is recommended that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders preferentially could be given 2 hours after mycophenolate mofetil intake to minimize the impact on the absorption of MPA. </p>

<h2>Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole</h2>
<p class="First">Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) to 12 healthy male volunteers on day 8 of a 10 day course of trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg administered bid, no effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed. The mean (±SD) AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of MPA after concomitant administration were 75.2 (±19.8) mcg•h/mL and 34 (±6.6) mcg/mL, respectively, compared to 79.2 (±27.9) mcg•h/mL and 34.2 (±10.7) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone.</p>

<h2>Norfloxacin and Metronidazole</h2>
<p class="First">Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) to 11 healthy volunteers on day 4 of a 5 day course of a combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole, the mean MPA AUC<span class="Sub">(0-48h)</span> was significantly reduced by 33% compared to the administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone (p&lt;0.05). Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with the combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole. There was no significant effect on mean MPA AUC<span class="Sub">(0-48h)</span> when mycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. The mean (±SD) MPA AUC<span class="Sub">(0-48h)</span> after coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately was 48.3 (±24) μg·h/mL and 42.7 (±23) mcg·h/mL, respectively, compared with 56.2 (±24) mcg·h/mL after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone.  </p>

<h2>Ciprofloxacin and Amoxicillin plus Clavulanic Acid</h2>
<p class="First">A total of 64 mycophenolate mofetil-treated renal transplant recipients received either oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 375 mg tid for 7 or at least 14 days. Approximately 50% reductions in median trough MPA concentrations (pre-dose) from baseline (mycophenolate mofetil alone) were observed in 3 days following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. These reductions in trough MPA concentrations tended to diminish within 14 days of antibiotic therapy and ceased within 3 days after discontinuation of antibiotics. The postulated mechanism for this interaction is an antibiotic-induced reduction in glucuronidase-possessing enteric organisms leading to a decrease in enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. The change in trough level may not accurately represent changes in overall MPA exposure; therefore, clinical relevance of these observations is unclear.</p>

<h2>Rifampin</h2>
<p class="First">In a single heart-lung transplant patient, after correction for dose, a 67% decrease in MPA exposure AUC<span class="Sub">(0-12h)</span> has been observed with concomitant administration of mycophenolate mofetil and rifampin. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with rifampin concomitantly unless the benefit outweighs the risk.</p>

<h2>Other Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">The measured value for renal clearance of MPAG indicates removal occurs by renal tubular secretion as well as glomerular filtration. Consistent with this, coadministration of probenecid, a known inhibitor of tubular secretion, with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys results in a 3-fold increase in plasma MPAG AUC and a 2-fold increase in plasma MPA AUC. Thus, other drugs known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with MPAG and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other drug undergoing tubular secretion.</p>
<p>Drugs that alter the gastrointestinal flora may interact with mycophenolate mofetil by disrupting enterohepatic recirculation. Interference of MPAG hydrolysis may lead to less MPA available for absorption.</p>

<h2>Live Vaccines</h2>
<p class="First">During treatment with mycophenolate mofetil, the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided and patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID_263a33f2-37bc-4a70-9d96-c52314c92492">PRECAUTIONS: Immunizations</a></span>).<span class="Bold"></span><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4266367" conceptname="Influenza">Influenza</span> vaccination may be of value.

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">In a 104-week oral carcinogenicity study in mice, mycophenolate mofetil in daily doses up to 180 mg/kg was not tumorigenic. The highest dose tested was 0.5 times the recommended clinical dose (2 g/day) in renal transplant patients and 0.3 times the recommended clinical dose (3 g/day) in cardiac transplant patients when corrected for differences in body surface area (BSA). In a 104-week oral carcinogenicity study in rats, mycophenolate mofetil in daily doses up to 15 mg/kg was not tumorigenic. The highest dose was 0.08 times the recommended clinical dose in renal transplant patients and 0.05 times the recommended clinical dose in cardiac transplant patients when corrected for BSA. While these animal doses were lower than those given to patients, they were maximal in those species and were considered adequate to evaluate the potential for human risk (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_warnings_id_08ea750f-2931-4cfc-b0fe-6d1650df6d3a">WARNINGS</a></span>).<span class="Bold"></span></p>
<p>The genotoxic potential of mycophenolate mofetil was determined in five assays. Mycophenolate mofetil was genotoxic in the mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span>/thymidine kinase assay and the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus assay. Mycophenolate mofetil was not genotoxic in the bacterial mutation assay, the yeast mitotic gene conversion assay or the Chinese hamster ovary cell chromosomal aberration assay.</p>
<p>Mycophenolate mofetil had no effect on fertility of male rats at oral doses up to 20 mg/kg/day. This dose represents 0.1 times the recommended clinical dose in renal transplant patients and 0.07 times the recommended clinical dose in cardiac transplant patients when corrected for BSA. In a female fertility and reproduction study conducted in rats, oral doses of 4.5 mg/kg/day caused malformations (principally of the head and eyes) in the first generation offspring in the absence of maternal toxicity. This dose was 0.02 times the recommended clinical dose in renal transplant patients and 0.01 times the recommended clinical dose in cardiac transplant patients when corrected for BSA. No effects on fertility or reproductive parameters were evident in the dams or in the subsequent generation.</p>

<p>Use of MMF during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and an increased risk of congenital malformations, especially external ear and other facial abnormalities including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134144" conceptname="Cleft palate with cleft lip">cleft lip and palate</span>, and anomalies of the distal limbs, heart, esophagus, and kidney. In animal studies, congenital malformations and pregnancy loss occurred when pregnant rats and rabbits received mycophenolic acid at dose multiples similar to and less than clinical doses. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.</p>
<p>Risks and benefits of mycophenolate mofetil should be discussed with the patient. When appropriate, consider alternative immunosuppressants with less potential for embryofetal toxicity. In certain situations, the patient and her healthcare practitioner may decide that the maternal benefits outweigh the risks to the fetus. For those females using mycophenolate mofetil at any time during pregnancy and those becoming pregnant within 6 weeks of discontinuing therapy, the healthcare practitioner should report the pregnancy to the Mycophenolate Pregnancy Registry (1-800-617-8191). The healthcare practitioner should strongly encourage the patient to enroll in the pregnancy registry. The information provided to the registry will help the healthcare community better understand the effects of mycophenolate in pregnancy.</p>
<p>In the National Transplantation Pregnancy Registry (NTPR), there were data on 33 MMF-exposed pregnancies in 24 transplant patients; there were 15 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4067106" conceptname="Miscarriage">spontaneous abortions</span> (45%) and 18 live-born infants. Four of these 18 infants had structural malformations (22%). In postmarketing data (collected 1995-2007) on 77 females exposed to systemic MMF during pregnancy, 25 had <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4067106" conceptname="Miscarriage">spontaneous abortions</span> and 14 had a malformed infant or fetus. Six of 14 malformed offspring had ear abnormalities. Because these postmarketing data are reported voluntarily, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency of particular adverse outcomes. These malformations are similar to findings in animal reproductive toxicology studies. For comparison, the background rate for congenital anomalies in the United States is about 3%, and NTPR data show a rate of 4-5% among babies born to organ transplant patients using other immunosuppressive drugs.</p>
<p>In animal reproductive toxicology studies, there were increased rates of fetal resorptions and malformations in the absence of maternal toxicity. Female rats and rabbits received mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) doses equivalent to 0.02 to 0.9 times the recommended human dose for renal and cardiac transplant patients, based on body surface area conversions. In rat offspring, malformations included <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434143" conceptname="Anophthalmos">anophthalmia</span>, agnathia, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4043738" conceptname="Hydrocephalus">hydrocephaly</span>.

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Studies in rats treated with mycophenolate mofetil have shown mycophenolic acid to be excreted in milk. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from mycophenolate mofetil, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of mycophenolate mofetil did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and of concomitant or other drug therapy. Elderly patients may be at an increased risk of adverse reactions compared with younger individuals (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_adverse_effects_id_54cfa143-a6b6-4d2e-a3fc-94615190afe2">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span>).</p>

<p>The placebo-controlled renal transplant study generally showed fewer adverse events occurring in ≥ 20% of patients.

<h2>Mycophenolate Mofetil Intravenous</h2>
<p class="First">The adverse event profile of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous was determined from a single, double-blind, controlled comparative study of the safety of 2 g/day of intravenous and oral mycophenolate mofetil in renal transplant patients in the immediate posttransplant period (administered for the first 5 days). The potential venous irritation of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous was evaluated by comparing the adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous with those observed in the intravenous placebo group; patients in this group received active medication by the oral route.</p>
<p>Adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318174" conceptname="Phlebitis">phlebitis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4130722" conceptname="Thrombosis">thrombosis</span>, both observed at 4% in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil intravenous.</p>
<p>In the active controlled study in hepatic transplant patients, 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous were administered in the immediate posttransplant period (up to 14 days). The safety profile of intravenous mycophenolate mofetil was similar to that of intravenous azathioprine.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">The experience with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> of mycophenolate mofetil in humans is very limited. The events received from reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> within the known safety profile of the drug. The highest dose administered to renal transplant patients in clinical trials has been 4 g/day. In limited experience with cardiac and hepatic transplant patients in clinical trials, the highest doses used were 4 g/day or 5 g/day. At doses of 4 g/day or 5 g/day, there appears to be a higher rate, compared to the use of 3 g/day or less, of gastrointestinal intolerance (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>), and occasional hematologic abnormalities, principally <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span>, leading to a need to reduce or discontinue dosing.</p>
<p>In acute oral toxicity studies, no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> occurred in adult mice at doses up to 4000 mg/kg or in adult monkeys at doses up to 1000 mg/kg; these were the highest doses of mycophenolate mofetil tested in these species. These doses represent 11 times the recommended clinical dose in renal transplant patients and approximately 7 times the recommended clinical dose in cardiac transplant patients when corrected for BSA. In adult rats, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> occurred after single-oral doses of 500 mg/kg of mycophenolate mofetil. The dose represents approximately 3 times the recommended clinical dose in cardiac transplant patients when corrected for BSA.</p>
<p>MPA and MPAG are usually not removed by hemodialysis. However, at high MPAG plasma concentrations (&gt;100 mcg/mL), small amounts of MPAG are removed. By increasing excretion of the drug, MPA can be removed by bile acid sequestrants, such as cholestyramine (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_section_id_55fc4149-95e1-442d-bc4d-947fde83a97f">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics</a></span>).</p>

<h2>Mycophenolate Mofetil Capsules, Tablets and Oral Suspension</h2>
<p class="First">The initial oral dose of mycophenolate mofetil should be given as soon as possible following renal, cardiac or hepatic transplantation. Food had no effect on MPA AUC, but has been shown to decrease MPA C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 40%. Therefore, it is recommended that mycophenolate mofetil be administered on an empty stomach. However, in stable renal transplant patients, mycophenolate mofetil may be administered with food if necessary.</p>
<p>Patients should be instructed to take a missed dose as soon as they remember, except if it is near the next scheduled dose, and then continue to take mycophenolate mofetil at the usual times.</p>
