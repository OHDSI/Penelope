<h3></h3>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Eprosartan:</span></span> Angiotensin II (formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme [kininase II]), a potent vasoconstrictor, is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone synthesis and secretion by the adrenal cortex, cardiac contraction, renal resorption of sodium, activity of the sympathetic nervous system, and smooth muscle cell growth. Eprosartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor found in many tissues (e.g., vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). There is also an AT<span class="Sub">2</span> receptor found in many tissues but it is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Eprosartan does not exhibit any partial agonist activity at the AT<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor. Its affinity for the AT<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor is 1,000 times greater than for the AT<span class="Sub">2</span> receptor. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> binding studies indicate that eprosartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor. Blockade of the AT<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor removes the negative feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II do not overcome the effect of eprosartan on blood pressure. TEVETEN<span class="Sup">®</span> HCT does not inhibit kininase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin; whether this has clinical relevance is not known. It does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. </p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hydrochlorothiazide:</span></span> Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so coadministration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown. </p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Eprosartan:</span></span> Eprosartan inhibits the pharmacologic effects of angiotensin II infusions in healthy adult men. Single oral doses of eprosartan from 10 mg to 400 mg have been shown to inhibit the vasopressor, renal vasoconstrictive and aldosterone secretory effects of infused angiotensin II with complete inhibition evident at doses of 350 mg and above. Eprosartan inhibits the pressor effects of angiotensin II infusions. A single oral dose of 350 mg of eprosartan inhibits pressor effects by approximately 100% at peak, with approximately 30% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. The absence of angiotensin II AT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonist activity has been demonstrated in healthy adult men. In hypertensive patients treated chronically with eprosartan, there was a twofold rise in angiotensin II plasma concentration and a twofold rise in plasma renin activity, while plasma aldosterone levels remained unchanged. Serum potassium levels also remained unchanged in these patients. Achievement of maximal blood pressure response to a given dose in most patients may take 2 to 3 weeks of treatment.

Eprosartan increases mean effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) in salt-replete and salt-restricted normal subjects. A dose-related increase in ERPF of 25% to 30% occurred in salt-restricted normal subjects, with the effect plateauing between 200 mg and 400 mg doses. There was no change in ERPF in hypertensive patients and patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> on normal salt diets.

<h2>Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality </h2>

Several dozen cases have been reported in the world literature in patients who were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. When pregnancy is detected, TEVETEN<span class="Sup">®</span> HCT should be discontinued as soon as possible. The use of drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy has been associated with fetal and neonatal injury, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, neonatal skull hypoplasia, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090272" conceptname="Anuria">anuria</span>, reversible or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198185" conceptname="Chronic renal failure">irreversible renal failure</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">Oligohydramnios</span> has also been reported, presumably resulting from decreased fetal renal function; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> in this setting has been associated with fetal limb <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208264" conceptname="Muscle contracture">contractures</span>, craniofacial deformation, and hypoplastic lung development. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439128" conceptname="Extreme immaturity">Prematurity</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80204" conceptname="Fetal growth restriction">intrauterine growth retardation</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315922" conceptname="Patent ductus arteriosus">patent ductus arteriosus</span> have also been reported, although it is not clear whether these occurrences were due to exposure to the drug. These adverse effects do not appear to have resulted from intrauterine drug exposure that has been limited to the first trimester. Mothers whose embryos and fetuses are exposed to an angiotensin II receptor antagonist only during the first trimester should be so informed. Nonetheless, when patients become pregnant, physicians should advise the patient to discontinue the use of eprosartan as soon as possible. Rarely (probably less often than once in every thousand pregnancies), no alternative to a drug acting on the renin-angiotensin system will be found. In these rare cases, the mothers should be apprised of the potential hazards to their fetuses, and serial ultrasound examinations should be performed to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> is observed, TEVETEN<span class="Sup">®</span> HCT should be discontinued unless it is considered life-saving for the mother. Contraction stress testing (CST), a nonstress test (NST) or biophysical profiling (BPP) may be appropriate, depending upon the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury.

If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306451" conceptname="Oliguria">oliguria</span> occurs, attention should be directed toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusion or dialysis may be required as means of reversing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> and/or substituting for disordered renal function. Eprosartan mesylate, alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, has been shown to produce maternal and fetal toxicities (maternal and fetal mortality, low maternal body weight and food consumption, resorptions, abortions and litter loss) in pregnant rabbits given oral doses as low as 10 mg eprosartan/kg/day and 3 mg hydrochlorothiazide/kg/day. No maternal or fetal adverse effects were observed in rabbits at 3 mg eprosartan/kg/day alone or in combination with 1 mg/kg/day of hydrochlorothiazide; this oral dose yielded a systemic exposure (AUC) to unbound eprosartan approximately equal to the human systemic exposure achieved with the dose of eprosartan mesylate contained in the maximum recommended human dose of TEVETEN<span class="Sup">®</span> HCT (600 mg eprosartan/day). No adverse effects on <span class="Italics">in utero</span> or postnatal development and maturation of offspring were observed when eprosartan mesylate was administered to pregnant rats at oral doses up to 1000 mg eprosartan/kg/day (the 1000 mg eprosartan/kg/day dose in non-pregnant rats yielded systemic exposure to unbound eprosartan approximately 0.8 times the exposure achieved in humans given 600 mg/day).

Ranitidine also has no effect on eprosartan pharmacokinetics. Eprosartan (up to 400 mg b.i.d. or 800 mg q.d.) doses have been safely used concomitantly with a thiazide diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide). Eprosartan doses of up to 300 mg b.i.d. have been safely used concomitantly with sustained-release calcium channel blockers (sustained-release nifedipine) with no clinically significant adverse interactions. As with other drugs that block angiotensin II or its effects, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride), potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s52">PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients, Potassium Supplements</a></span>). </p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility </h2>
<p class="First">No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with eprosartan mesylate in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. Eprosartan mesylate was not carcinogenic in dietary restricted rats or <span class="Italics">ad libitum</span> fed mice dosed at 600 mg and 2000 mg eprosartan/kg/day, respectively, for up to 2 years. In male and female rats, the systemic exposure (AUC) to unbound eprosartan at the dose evaluated was only approximately 25% of the exposure achieved in humans given TEVETEN<span class="Sup">®</span> HCT. In mice, the systemic exposure (AUC) to unbound eprosartan was approximately 35 times the exposure achieved in humans given TEVETEN<span class="Sup">®</span> HCT. Two-year feeding studies in mice and rats conducted under the auspices of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) uncovered no evidence of a carcinogenic potential of hydrochlorothiazide in female mice (at doses of up to approximately 600 mg/kg/day) or in male and female rats (at doses of up to approximately 100 mg/kg/day). The NTP, however, found equivocal evidence for hepatocarcinogenicity in male mice. Eprosartan mesylate was not mutagenic <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> in mammalian cells (mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> assay). Eprosartan mesylate alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide was not mutagenic <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> in bacteria (Ames test) and did not cause structural chromosomal damage <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> (mouse micronucleus assay).

In the same assay, eprosartan mesylate alone was associated with polyploidy but there was only equivocal evidence of structural chromosomal damage. Hydrochlorothiazide was not genotoxic <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> in the Ames test and in the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) test for chromosomal aberrations, or <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> in assays using mouse germinal cell chromosomes, Chinese hamster bone marrow chromosomes, and the <span class="Italics">Drosophila</span> sex-linked recessive lethal trait gene.

No fertility studies have been conducted with eprosartan mesylate in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. Eprosartan mesylate had no adverse effects on the reproductive performance of male or female rats at oral doses up to 1000 mg eprosartan/kg/day. Hydrochlorothiazide had no adverse effects on the fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies wherein these species were exposed, via their diet, to doses of up to 100 and 4 mg/kg/day, respectively, prior to conception and throughout gestation. </p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS </h1>
<p class="First">TEVETEN<span class="Sup">®</span> HCT 600/12.5 mg has been evaluated for safety in 268 patients in double-blind, controlled clinical trials. Most of these patients were treated with TEVETEN<span class="Sup">®</span> HCT 600/12.5 mg for 29 to 60 days. Eprosartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy has been evaluated for safety in 890 patients in open-label, long-term clinical trials. Approximately 50% of these patients were treated with eprosartan/hydrochlorothiazide for over 2 years. Eprosartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy was well tolerated. Most adverse events were of mild or moderate severity and did not require discontinuation of therapy. Adverse experiences were similar in patients regardless of age, gender, or race. In the controlled clinical trials, about 3% of the 268 patients treated with TEVETEN<span class="Sup">®</span> HCT 600/12.5 mg discontinued therapy due to clinical adverse experiences. </p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION </h1>
<p class="First">The usual recommended starting dose of eprosartan is 600 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-depleted (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s39">WARNINGS, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> in Volume- and/or Salt-Depleted Patients</a></span>). Eprosartan can be administered once or twice daily and total daily doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. There is limited experience with doses beyond 800 mg/day. If the antihypertensive effect measured at trough using once-daily monotherapy dosing is inadequate, a twice-a-day regimen at the same total daily dose or an increase in dose may give a more satisfactory response. Achievement of maximum blood pressure reduction in most patients may take 2 to 3 weeks. Hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 mg to 50 mg once daily. To minimize dose-independent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy. The side effects (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s37">WARNINGS</a></span>) of eprosartan are generally rare and apparently independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-dependent (primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>) and dose-independent (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192640" conceptname="Pancreatitis">pancreatitis</span>) phenomena, the former much more common than the latter. Therapy with any combination of eprosartan and hydrochlorothiazide will be associated with both sets of dose-independent side effects. </p>

<h2>Replacement Therapy </h2>
<p class="First">TEVETEN<span class="Sup">®</span> HCT may be substituted for the individual components. The usual recommended dose of TEVETEN<span class="Sup">®</span> HCT is 600 mg/12.5 mg once daily when used as combination therapy in patients who are not volume-depleted (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s39">WARNINGS, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> in Volume-and/or Salt-Depleted Patients</a></span>). If the antihypertensive effect measured at trough using TEVETEN<span class="Sup">®</span> HCT 600/12.5 mg is inadequate, patients may be titrated to TEVETEN<span class="Sup">®</span> HCT 600/25 mg once daily. Higher doses have not been studied in combination. Achievement of maximum blood pressure reduction in most patients may take 2 to 3 weeks. If the patient under treatment with TEVETEN<span class="Sup">®</span> HCT requires additional blood pressure control at trough, or to maintain a twice a day dosing schedule of monotherapy, 300 mg TEVETEN<span class="Sup">®</span> may be added as evening dose. TEVETEN<span class="Sup">®</span> HCT may be used in combination with other antihypertensive agents such as calcium channel blockers if additional blood-pressure-lowering effect is required. Discontinuation of treatment with eprosartan does not lead to a rapid rebound increase in blood pressure. </p>
