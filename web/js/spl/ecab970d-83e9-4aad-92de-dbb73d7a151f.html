<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Phenytoin is an antiepileptic drug which can be used in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>. The primary site of action appears to be the <span class="Italics">motor cortex</span> where spread of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> activity is inhibited.  Possibly by promoting sodium efflux from neurons, phenytoin tends to <span class="Italics">stabilize</span> the threshold against <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">hyperexcitability</span> caused by excessive stimulation or environmental changes capable of reducing membrane sodium gradient. This includes the reduction of posttetanic potentiation at synapses. Loss of posttetanic potentiation prevents cortical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> foci from detonating adjacent cortical areas. Phenytoin reduces the maximal activity of brain stem centers responsible for the tonic phase of tonic-clonic (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="374924" conceptname="Generalized convulsive epilepsy">grand mal</span>) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>.</p>
<p>The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5–7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day.</p>
<p>When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5–7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. For Dilantin capsules, peak serum levels occur 4 to 12 hours after administration.</p>
<p>Optimum control without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum levels between 10 and 20 mcg/mL, although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="374924" conceptname="Generalized convulsive epilepsy">grand mal</span>) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin.</p>
<p>In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved.  There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages.  Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin.  Unusually high levels result from liver disease, congenital enzyme deficiency, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin plasma levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal.</p>
<p>Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but more importantly by tubular secretion. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high plasma levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more.</p>

<a name="section-5.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Effects of Abrupt Withdrawal</h2>
<p class="First">Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span>. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative antiepileptic medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reaction</span>, rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an antiepileptic drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322252" conceptname="Suicidal behavior">Suicidal Behavior</span> and Ideation</h2>
<p class="First">Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including Dilantin, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</p>
<p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322252" conceptname="Suicidal behavior">suicidal behavior</span> or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>.</p>
<p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</p>
<p>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5–100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.</p>

<p>The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> and psychiatric indications.</p>
<p>Anyone considering prescribing Dilantin or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">Epilepsy</span> and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior.  Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.</p>
<p>Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.</p>

<span class="Italics">Risks to Mother.</span> An increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of plasma phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage (see <a href="#Prec-LabTests">PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests</a>).

<span class="Italics">Risks to the Fetus.</span> If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking the drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. <p class="First">Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), minor anomalies (dysmorphic facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia), growth abnormalities (including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381114" conceptname="Microcephalus">microcephaly</span>), and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440389" conceptname="Mental retardation">mental deficiency</span> have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy.

The overall incidence of malformations for children of epileptic women treated with antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin and/or others) during pregnancy is about 10%, or two- to three-fold that in the general population. However, the relative contributions of antiepileptic drugs and other factors associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> to this increased risk are uncertain and in most cases it has not been possible to attribute specific developmental abnormalities to particular antiepileptic drugs.</p>

<p>Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using another anticonvulsive drug.  Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin.  Consideration should be given to avoiding use of  drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including Dilantin, in HLA-B*1502 positive patients when alternative therapies are otherwise equally available.</p>

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Inform patients of the availability of a Medication Guide, and instruct them to read the Medication Guide prior to taking Dilantin. Instruct patients to take Dilantin only as prescribed.</p>
<p>Patients taking phenytoin should be advised of the importance of adhering strictly to the prescribed dosage regimen, and of informing the physician of any clinical condition in which it is not possible to take the drug orally as prescribed, e.g., surgery, etc.</p>
<p>Patients should also be cautioned on the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking the physician's advice.  </p>
<p>Patients should be instructed to call their physician if <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">skin rash</span> develops.</p>
<p>The importance of good dental hygiene should be stressed in order to minimize the development of gingival <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4296894" conceptname="Hyperplasia">hyperplasia</span> and its complications.</p>
<p>Patients, their caregivers, and families should be counseled that AEDs, including Dilantin, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.</p>
<p>Patients should be encouraged to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This Registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptics drugs during pregnancy. To enroll, patients can call the toll free number 1-888-233-2334 (see <a href="#PrePreg">PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy</a> section).</p>

<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">Phenytoin serum level determinations may be necessary to achieve optimal dosage adjustments.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34073-7">
<a name="section-6.4"></a><p></p>
<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">There are many drugs which may increase or decrease phenytoin levels or which phenytoin may affect. Serum level determinations for phenytoin are especially helpful when possible drug interactions are suspected. The most commonly occurring drug interactions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Drugs which may increase phenytoin serum levels include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, fluorouracil, fluvoxamine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, omeprazole, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, sertraline, succinimides, sulfonamides, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone.</li>
<li>Drugs which may decrease phenytoin levels include: carbamazepine, chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433753" conceptname="Alcohol abuse">alcohol abuse</span>, reserpine, and sucralfate. Moban<span class="Sup">®</span> brand of molindone hydrochloride contains calcium ions which interfere with the absorption of phenytoin. Ingestion times of phenytoin and antacid preparations containing calcium should be staggered in patients with low serum phenytoin levels to prevent absorption problems.</li>
<li>Drugs which may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels include: phenobarbital, sodium valproate, and valproic acid. Similarly, the effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, teniposide, valproic acid, and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable.</li>
<li>Although not a true drug interaction, tricyclic antidepressants may precipitate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> in susceptible patients and phenytoin dosage may need to be adjusted.</li>
<li>Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin include: azoles, corticosteroids, coumarin anticoagulants, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, teniposide, theophylline, vitamin D.</li>
</ol>

<a name="section-6.4.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction</h3>
<p class="First">Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin plasma levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients.</p>

<h2>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of T4. It may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT).</p>
<p>Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure plasma phenytoin concentrations.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Serum concentrations should be monitored in changing from Dilantin (extended phenytoin sodium  capsules, USP to Prompt Phenytoin Sodium Capsules, USP, and from the sodium salt to the free acid form.</p>
<p>Dilantin (extended phenytoin sodium capsules, USP) are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin.  The free acid form of phenytoin is used in Dilantin-125 Suspension and Dilantin Infatabs.  Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-9.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments—the clinically effective serum level is usually 10–20 mcg/mL. With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days.</p>

<p class="First">In adults, if <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> control is established with divided doses of three 100-mg Dilantin (extended phenytoin sodium capsules, USP) daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg of Dilantin (extended phenytoin sodium capsules, USP) may be considered.  Studies comparing divided doses of 300 mg with a single daily dose of this quantity indicated absorption, peak plasma levels, biologic half-life, difference between peak and minimum values, and urinary recovery were equivalent. Once-a-day dosage offers a convenience to the individual patient or to nursing personnel for institutionalized patients and is intended to be used only for patients requiring this amount of drug daily. A major problem in motivating noncompliant patients may also be lessened when the patient can take this drug once a day. However, patients should be cautioned not to miss a dose, inadvertently.</p>
<p>Only Dilantin (extended phenytoin sodium capsules, USP) are recommended for once-a-day dosing. Inherent differences in dissolution characteristics and resultant absorption rates of phenytoin due to different manufacturing procedures and/or dosage forms preclude such recommendation for other phenytoin products. When a change in the dosage form or brand is prescribed, careful monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be carried out. </p>

<a name="section-9.2.3"></a><p></p>
<h3>Loading dose</h3>
<p class="First">Some authorities have advocated use of an oral loading dose of phenytoin in adults who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desirable.  This dosing regimen should be reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting where phenytoin serum levels can be closely monitored. Patients with a history of renal or liver disease should not receive the oral loading regimen.</p>
<p>Initially, one gram of Dilantin (extended phenytoin sodium capsules, USP) is divided into three doses (400 mg, 300 mg, 300 mg) and administered at two-hour intervals. Normal maintenance dosage is then instituted 24 hours after the loading dose, with frequent serum level determinations.</p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-9.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Pediatric Dosage</h2>
<p class="First">Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years old and adolescents may require the minimum adult dose (300 mg/day).</p>
