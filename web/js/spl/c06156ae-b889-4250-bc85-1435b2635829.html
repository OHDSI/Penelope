<p>This syndrome often presents as peaked T-waves and sudden <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span> within minutes after the administration of the drug in healthy appearing pediatric patients (usually, but not exclusively, males, and most frequently 8 years of age or younger). There have also been reports in adolescents.</p>
<p>Therefore, when a healthy appearing infant or child develops <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span> soon after administration of succinylcholine, not felt to be due to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or anesthetic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, immediate treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span> should be instituted. This should include administration of intravenous calcium, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span>, and glucose with insulin, with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316814" conceptname="Hyperventilation">hyperventilation</span>. Due to the abrupt onset of this syndrome, routine resuscitative measures are likely to be unsuccessful.

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Succinylcholine is a depolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4189159" conceptname="Muscle fibrillation">fasciculations</span>. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4193951" conceptname="Flaccid paralysis">flaccid paralysis</span> is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes.</p>
<p>Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052720" conceptname="Acetylcholinesterase">cholinesterase</span> to succinylmonocholine (which possesses clinically insignificant depolarizing muscle relaxant properties) and then more slowly to succinic acid and choline (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics"><a href="#de03de59-0423-41d5-97bd-8707e307e9c7">PRECAUTIONS</a></span></span></span>). About 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Succinylcholine levels were reported to be below the detection limit of 2 Âµg/mL after 2.5Â minutes of an IV bolus dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg in fourteen (14) anesthetized patients. </p>
<p>The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440377" conceptname="Paralysis">paralysis</span> following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles.</p>
<p>Succinylcholine has no direct action on the uterus or other smooth muscle structures. Because it is highly ionized and has low fat solubility, it does not readily cross the placenta.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052861" conceptname="Tachyphylaxis">Tachyphylaxis</span> occurs with repeated administration (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics"><a href="#de03de59-0423-41d5-97bd-8707e307e9c7">PRECAUTIONS</a></span></span></span>).</p>
<p>Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440377" conceptname="Paralysis">paralysis</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">weakness</span> in patients who manifest the transition to PhaseÂ II block. When this diagnosis is confirmed by peripheral nerve stimulation, it may sometimes be reversed with anticholinesterase drugs such as neostigmine (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics"><a href="#de03de59-0423-41d5-97bd-8707e307e9c7">PRECAUTIONS</a></span></span></span>). Anticholinesterase drugs may not always be effective. If given before succinylcholine is metabolized by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052720" conceptname="Acetylcholinesterase">cholinesterase</span>, anticholinesterase drugs may prolong rather than shorten <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440377" conceptname="Paralysis">paralysis</span>.</p>
<p>Succinylcholine has no direct effect on the myocardium. Succinylcholine stimulates both autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors which may cause changes in cardiac rhythm, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span>. Changes in rhythm, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span>, may also result from vagal stimulation, which may occur during surgical procedures, or from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span>, particularly in pediatric patients (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics"><a href="#de03de59-0423-41d5-97bd-8707e307e9c7">PRECAUTIONS</a>:</span></span></span>Â <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Pediatric Use</span></span>). These effects are enhanced by halogenated anesthetics.</p>
<p>Succinylcholine causes an increase in intraocular pressure immediately after its injection and during the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4189159" conceptname="Muscle fibrillation">fasciculation</span> phase, and slight increases which may persist after onset of complete <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440377" conceptname="Paralysis">paralysis</span> (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics"><a href="#b097ae54-cf24-49f8-a0ed-93cb24240b28">WARNINGS</a></span></span></span>).</p>
<p>Succinylcholine may cause slight increases in intracranial pressure immediately after its injection and during the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4189159" conceptname="Muscle fibrillation">fasciculation</span> phase (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics"><a href="#de03de59-0423-41d5-97bd-8707e307e9c7">PRECAUTIONS</a></span></span></span>).</p>
<p>As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the potential for releasing histamine is present following succinylcholine administration. Signs and symptoms of histamine mediated release such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318566" conceptname="Flushing">flushing</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256717" conceptname="Bronchospasm">bronchoconstriction</span> are, however, uncommon in normal clinical usage.</p>
<p>Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> threshold or cerebration. It should be used only with adequate anesthesia (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics"><a href="#b097ae54-cf24-49f8-a0ed-93cb24240b28">WARNINGS</a></span></span></span>).</p>

The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052861" conceptname="Tachyphylaxis">tachyphylaxis</span> and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N<span class="Sub">2</span>O/O<span class="Sub">2</span>/narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052861" conceptname="Tachyphylaxis">Tachyphylaxis</span> was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery.</p>
<p>When Phase II block is suspected in cases of prolonged <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">neuromuscular blockade</span>, positive diagnosis should be made by peripheral nerve stimulation, prior to administration of any anticholinesterase drug. Reversal of Phase II block is a medical decision which must be made upon the basis of the individual, clinical pharmacology and the experience and judgment of the physician. The presence of Phase II block is indicated by fade of responses to successive stimuli (preferably â€œtrain of fourâ€?). The use of an anticholinesterase drug to reverse Phase II block should be accompanied by appropriate doses of an anticholinergic drug to prevent disturbances of cardiac rhythm. After adequate reversal of Phase II block with an anticholinesterase agent, the patient should be continually observed for at least 1 hour for signs of return of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">muscle relaxation</span>. Reversal should not be attempted unless: (1) a peripheral nerve stimulator is used to determine the presence of Phase II block (since anticholinesterase agents will potentiate succinylcholine-induced Phase I block), and (2) spontaneous recovery of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4247265" conceptname="Muscle twitch">muscle twitch</span> has been observed for at least 20 minutes and has reached a plateau with further recovery proceeding slowly; this delay is to ensure complete hydrolysis of succinylcholine by plasma <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052720" conceptname="Acetylcholinesterase">cholinesterase</span> prior to administration of the anticholinesterase agent. Should the type of block be misdiagnosed, depolarization of the type initially induced by succinylcholine (i.e., Phase I block) will be prolonged by an anticholinesterase agent.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">The dosage of succinylcholine should be individualized and should always be determined by the clinician after careful assessment of the patient (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics"><a href="#b097ae54-cf24-49f8-a0ed-93cb24240b28">WARNINGS</a></span></span></span>).</p>
<p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Solutions which are not clear and colorless should not be used.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Adults:</span></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">For Short Surgical Procedures</span></span>: The average dose required to produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">neuromuscular blockade</span> and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg Quelicin (succinylcholine chloride) Injection given intravenously. The optimum dose will vary among individuals and may be from 0.3 to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following administration of doses in this range, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">neuromuscular blockade</span> develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. However, very large doses may result in more prolonged blockade. A 5Â to 10 mg test dose may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics"><a href="#de03de59-0423-41d5-97bd-8707e307e9c7">PRECAUTIONS</a></span></span></span>).</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">For Long Surgical Procedures:</span></span> The dose of succinylcholine administered by infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">muscle relaxation</span>. The average rate for an adult ranges between 2.5 and 4.3 mg per minute.</p>
<p>Solutions containing from 1 to 2 mg per mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous infusion. The more dilute solution (1 mg per mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of the drug and, hence, of relaxation. This intravenous solution containing 1 mg per mL may be administered at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. The amount required per minute will depend upon the individual response as well as the degree of relaxation required. Avoid overburdening the circulation with a large volume of fluid. It is recommended that neuromuscular function be carefully monitored with a peripheral nerve stimulator when using succinylcholine by infusion in order to avoid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, detect development of Phase II block, follow its rate of recovery, and assess the effects of reversing agents (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics"><a href="#de03de59-0423-41d5-97bd-8707e307e9c7">PRECAUTIONS</a></span></span></span>).</p>
<p>Intermittent intravenous injections of succinylcholine may also be used to provide <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">muscle relaxation</span> for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further injections of 0.04 to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Pediatrics:</span></span>Â </p>
<p>For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of succinylcholine is 2 mg/kg for infants and small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the dose is 1 mg/kg (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#c148431e-1b59-4a4d-a6d0-63f61792c114">BOX WARNING</a></span></span> and <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics"><a href="#de03de59-0423-41d5-97bd-8707e307e9c7">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>:</span></span>Â <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Pediatric Use</span></span>). It is currently known that the effective dose of succinylcholine in pediatric patients may be higher than that predicted by body weight dosing alone. For example, the usual adult IV dose of <br>
    0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2-3 mg/kg in neonates and infants to 6 months and 1-2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age. This is thought to be due to the relatively large volume of distribution in the pediatric patient versus the adult patient.</p>
<p>Rarely, I.V. bolus administration of succinylcholine in infants and pediatric patients may result in malignant ventricular arrythmias and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span> secondary to acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4230337" conceptname="Rhabdomyolysis">rhabdomyolysis</span> with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span>.

As in adults, the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span> in pediatric patients is higher following a second dose of succinylcholine. Whereas <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span> is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span> is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. The occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228448" conceptname="Bradyarrhythmia">bradyarrhythmias</span> may be reduced by pretreatment with atropine (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics"><a href="#de03de59-0423-41d5-97bd-8707e307e9c7">PRECAUTIONS</a>:</span></span></span>Â <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Pediatric Use</span></span>).</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Intramuscular Use:</span></span> If necessary, succinylcholine may be given intramuscularly to infants, older pediatric patients or adults when a suitable vein is inaccessible. A dose of up to 3 to 4 mg/kg may be given, but not more than 150 mg total dose should be administered by this route. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Compatibility and Admixtures:</span></span> Succinylcholine is acidic (pH 3.5) and should not be mixed with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions). Admixtures containing 1 to 2 mg/mL may be prepared by adding 1 g Quelicin to 1000 or 500 mL sterile solution, such as 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Admixtures of Quelicin must be used within 24 hours after preparation. Aseptic techniques should be used to prepare the diluted product. Admixtures of Quelicin should be prepared for single patient use only. The unused portion of diluted Quelicin should be discarded.</p>
