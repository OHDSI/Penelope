<h1>PRECAUTIONS:</h1>
<p class="First">Prior to treatment with ReBalance Antiprotozoal Oral Suspension, EPM should be distinguished from the diseases that may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437584" conceptname="Ataxia">ataxia</span> in horses. injuries or lameness may also complicate the evaluation of an animal with EPM. In most instances, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437584" conceptname="Ataxia">ataxia</span> due to EPM is asymmetrical and affects the front and/or the hind limbs.</p>
<p>Treatment may cause generalized bone marrow suppression, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435224" conceptname="Leukopenia">leukopenia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span>. A complete blood count (CBC) should be performed monthly to monitor horses for development of these conditions. The administration of the drug may need to be discontinued and/or treatments for bone marrow suppression initiated.</p>
<p>Worsened neurologic deficits (treatment crisis) may be observed during a period beginning with the first few days of treatment with ReBalance Antiprotozoal Oral Suspension and ranging out to 5 weeks. This neurologic deficit exacerbation may be the result of an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammatory reaction</span> to the dying parasites in the CNS tissue.</p>
<p>The safe use of ReBalance Antiprotozoal Oral Suspension in horses used for breeding purposes during pregnancy, or in lactating mares has not been evaluated. The safety of ReBalance Antiprotozoal Oral Suspension with concomitant therapies in horses has not been evaluated.<br></p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</h1>
<p class="First">Seventy-five horses (37 horses in the 1X group, 38 horses in the 2X group) that were treated with test article for at least 90 days were evaluated for adverse reaction.</p>
<p>Bone marrow suppression: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">Anemia</span>: ReBalance Antiprotozoal Oral Suspension administration caused overall <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span> (classification of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span> based on HBC, Hgb, and PCV/HCT values in 12% of the observations in the 1X group and 21% of the 2X group. In the 1X group, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span> was noted in in 22%, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435224" conceptname="Leukopenia">leukopenia</span> in 19%, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span> in 5% and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span> in 3% of the cases. In the 2X group, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span> was noted in 58%, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435224" conceptname="Leukopenia">leukopenia</span> in 55%, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span> in 29% and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span> in 5% of the cases. The incidence of bone marrow suppression in the 2X treatment group was two or more times that of the 1X group and the degree of suppression was more serious (mild to severe vs. mild to moderate). because of these <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="40528016" conceptname="Disorder of hematopoietic system">blood dyscrasias</span>, test article was interrupted over four times more often in horses treated at the 2X dosage than those treated 1X, Although both groups were off treatment for about the same amount of time (approximately 20% of the treatment period). In some instances of bone marrow suppression, diet was supplemented with folinic acid.</p>
<p>GI: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">Anorexia</span> was observed in two horses in the 1X group and one hose in the 2X group.

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</h1>
<p class="First">Sulfonamides (a specific group of antimicrobial agents) and pyrimethamine are two different antimicrobial agents which inhibit folic acid synthesis at two different sites, in the same synthetic pathway. The combination of a sulfonamide and pyrimethamine is synergistic with the drug combination having an antiprotozoal effect.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34092-7">
<a name="section-10"></a><p></p>
<h1>EFFECTIVENESS SUMMARY:</h1>
<p class="First">A field effectiveness study was conducted at eight sites with eight investigators across the the United States. The study was conducted using historical controls. In the study each animal's response to treatment was compared to its pre-treatment values. The following standardized overall neurological dysfunction (OND) scale was used to grade the horses:</p>
<p>0 = Clinically normal. No detectable dysfunction.</p>
<p>1 = Slightly deficit. Dysfunction barely perceptible.</p>
<p>2 = Moderate deficit. Dysfunction easily detectable.</p>
<p>3 = Marked deficit. Dysfunction strikingly conspicuous.</p>
<p>4 = Severe deficit. profound dysfunction.5 = Recumbent.</p>
<p>ninety-seven horses were randomly assigned one of two treatment groups and administered a daily oral dose of ReBalance Antiprotozoal Oral Suspension for a minimum of 90 days. The two treatment groups were as follows:</p>
<p>(1) 1X labeled dose, 20 mg/kg sulfadiazine and 1 mg/kg pyrimethamine (48 horses); or</p>
<p>(2) 2X dose, twice the labeled dose, 40 mg/kg sulfadiazine and 2 mg/kg pyrimethamine (40 horses).</p>
<p>A physical examination and neurological evaluation and complete blood profile were conducted at the end of each 30-day treatment period for the first 90 days of treatment.</p>
<p>At the end of the 90-day treatment period, a videotape recording of the neurological condition and CSF and serum sample immunoblot and protein electrophoresis analysis were made. Based on the degree of clinical improvement and results of the CSF immunoblot analysis on test day 90 treatment in 30 day increments up to a period of 180 days was continued. In fourteen cases, the treatment was extended beyond 180 days (up to 270 days). A 30 day follow-up evaluation  was made following cessation of treatment.</p>
<p>Treatment success was defined as: (1) horse that became CSF <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4098368" conceptname="Immunofixation">Western Blot Test</span> negative with or without clinical improvement; and (2) a horse that remained CSF Western Blot Positive but demonstrated marked clinical improvement ( two or more grade improvement from baseline OND score).</p>
<p>Only the 1X dose was evaluated for effectiveness due to the toxicity (bone marrow suppression) seen in the 2X dose. of the forty eight horses assigned to the 1X group, 26 horses completed the study. Based on the improvement in the OND scores and/or a negative CSF immunoblot, 16 out of the 26 horses (61.5%) were considered successes. Five of the 26 horses (19.2%) , had a negative CSF immunoblot by day 150 of the study. Three of these five horses were also clinically successes based on the improvement in OND scores. Fourteen of the 26 horses (53.8%) were corroborated as successes by masked expert evaluation and videotapes.<br></p>

<h1>ANIMAL SAFETY:</h1>
<p class="First">ReBalance Antiprotozoal Oral Suspension was administered to ten horses (5 males and 5 females) ata dosage of 8 mL/50kg (110 lbs) a day (2X the labeled dose) for 92 days. Four horses (2 males and 2 females) were untreated controls.</p>
<p>Complete physical examinations, CBCs and serum chemistry values were determined on test days (TD) minus 14, TD minus 7, TD 0, biweekly throughout the 92 day treatment period and 14 and 29 days following the end of treatment.</p>
<p>Declines in RBC, HCT, Hgb and PCV were greater in the treated group and reached statistical significance. Twenty-nine days after cessation of treatment, blood parameter values returned to baseline levels. No clinical signals of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span> were observed in either group.</p>
<p>Most serum chemistry values remained within normal limits throughout the study in both groups. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) values were evaluated (slightly above the upper end of the normal range) in three treated horses on study day 84 and 105.</p>
<p>Loose stool, along with infrequent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, were noted in the treatment group. The conditions were transient and required no medical intervention.</p>
<p>A depressed appetite of 1 to 2 days duration occurred infrequently in all but one of the treated horses. One horse became anorexic and required a change in diet.</p>
<p>ReBalance Antiprotozoal Oral Suspension administered at 2X the recommended label for 92 days resulted in clinical signs of toxicity including transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">loose stools</span>; however, medical intervention was not necessary,<br></p>
