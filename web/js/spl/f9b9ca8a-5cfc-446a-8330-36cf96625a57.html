<h1>Description</h1>
<p class="First">For IV Infusion Only<br>Rx ONLY</p>
<p>To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of doxycycline and other antibacterial drugs, doxycycline should be used only to treat or prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria.</p>
<p>Doxycycline for Injection USP is a broad-spectrum antibiotic synthetically derived from oxytetracycline. It is a light yellow crystalline powder, and is available as doxycycline hydrochloride hemiethanolate hemihydrate. Chemically, doxycycline is 4- (DimethyIamino)-1,4,4a,5,5a,6,11,12a-octahydro-3,5,10,12,12a-pentahydroxy-6-methyl-1,11-dioxo-2-naphthacenecarboxamide monohydrochloride, compound with ethyl alcohol (2:1), monohydrate. Doxycycline has a high degree of lipoid solubiIity and a low affinity for calcium binding. It is highly stable in normal human serum. Each vial contains a sterile mixture of doxycycline hyclate equivalent to 100 mg doxycycline and 480 mg ascorbic acid. The structural formula of Doxycycline Hyclate is as follows:</p>

<h1>Clinical Pharmacology</h1>
<p class="First">Doxycycline is primarily bacteriostatic and thought to exert its antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. Doxycycline is active against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. The drugs in the tetracycline class have closely similar antimicrobial spectra, and cross resistance among them is common. Microorganisms may be considered susceptible to doxycycline (likely to respond to doxycycline therapy) if the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4190299" conceptname="Broth microdilution susceptibility test">minimum inhibitory concentration</span> (M.I.C.) is not more than 4 mcg/mL. Microorganisms may be considered intermediate (harboring partial resistance) if the M.I.C. is 4 to 12.5 mcg/mL and resistant (not likely to respond to therapy) if the M.I.C. is greater than 12.5 mcg/mL. Susceptibility Plate Testing: If the Kirby-Bauer method of disc susceptibility is used, a 30 mcg doxycycline disc should give a zone of at least 16 mm when tested against a doxycycline-susceptible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span>. A tetracycline disc may be used to determine microbial susceptibility. If the Kirby-Bauer method of disc susceptibility is used, a 30 mcg tetracycline disc should give a zone of at least 19 mm<br>when tested against a tetracycline-susceptible bacterial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span>. Tetracyclines are readily absorbed and are bound to plasma proteins in varying degree. They are concentrated by the liver in the bile, and excreted in the urine and feces at high concentrations and in a biologically active form. Following a 100 mg single dose administered in a concentration of 0.4 mg/mL in a one-hour infusion, normal adult volunteers average a peak of 2.5 mcg/mL, while 200 mg of a concentration of 0.4 mg/mL administered over two hours average a peak of 3.6 mcg/mL. Excretion of doxycycline by the kidney is about 40 percent/72 hours in individuals with normal function (creatinine clearance about 75 mL/min). This percentage excretion may <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> as low as 1 to 5 percent/72 hours in individuals with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> creatinine clearance below 10 mL/min). Studies have shown no significant difference in serum half-life of doxycycline (range 18 to 22 hours) in individuals with normal and severely <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>. Hemodialysis does not alter this serum half-life of doxycycline.</p>

Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used in this age group unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4080920" conceptname="Phytophotodermatitis">Photosensitivity</span> manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">skin erythema</span>. The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. Studies to date indicate that this does not occur with the use of doxycycline in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>. <br><span class="Bold"></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Usage in Pregnancy</span><br>(See WARNINGS about use during tooth development).<br>Intravenous doxycycline has not been studied in pregnant patients. It should not be used in pregnant women unless, in the judgement of the physician, it is essential for the welfare of the patient. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has also been noted in animals, treated early in pregnancy.<br><span class="Bold"></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use</span><br>The use of doxycycline in pediatric patients under 8 years is not recommended because safe conditions for its use have not been established. (See WARNINGS about use during tooth development). As with other tetracyclines, doxycycline forms a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in prematures given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Tetracyclines are present in the milk of lactating women who are taking a drug in this class.</p>

As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4105019" conceptname="Superimposed infection">superinfection</span> occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. In venereal diseases when coexistent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436033" conceptname="Syphilis">syphilis</span> is suspected, a dark field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least 4 months. Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. In long-term therapy, periodic laboratory evaluation of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed. All <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> due to group A beta-hemolytic streptococci should be treated for at least 10 days. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline in conjunction with penicillin.<br><span class="Bold"></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Information for Patients</span><br>Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including doxycycline should only be used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432545" conceptname="Bacterial infectious disease">bacterial infections</span>. They do not treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440029" conceptname="Viral disease">viral infections</span> (e.g., the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">common cold</span>). When doxycycline is prescribed to treat a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432545" conceptname="Bacterial infectious disease">bacterial infection</span>, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by doxycycline or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">Preparation of Solution</span><br>To prepare a solution containing 10 mg/mL, the contents of the vial should be reconstituted with 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, or any of the ten intravenous infusion solutions listed below. Each 100 mg of doxycycline (i.e., withdraw entire solution from the 100 mg vial) is further diluted with 100 to 1000 mL of the intravenous solutions listed below:<br></p>
<p>1. 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection<br>2. 5% Dextrose Injection<br>3. Ringer's Injection<br>4. Invert Sugar, 10% in Water<br>5. Lactated Ringer's Injection<br>6. Dextrose 5% in Lactated Ringer's<br>7. Normosol-M® in D5-W (Abbott)<br>8. Normosol-R® in D5-W (Abbott)<br>9. Plasma-Lyte® 56 in 5% Dextrose (Travenol)<br>10. Plasma-Lyte® 148 in 5% Dextrose (Travenol)<br></p>
<p>This will result in desired concentrations of 0.1 to 1 mg/mL. Concentrations lower than 0.1 mg/mL or higher than 1 mg/mL are not recommended.<br></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Stability</span><br>Doxycycline is stable for 48 hours in solution when diluted with Sodium Chloride Injection, or 5% Dextrose Injection, to concentrations between 1 mg/mL and 0.1 mg/mL and stored at 25°C. Doxycycline in these solutions is stable under fluorescent light for 48 hours, but must be protected from direct sunlight during storage and infusion. Reconstituted solutions (1 to 0.1 mg/mL) may be stored up to 72 hours prior to start of infusion if refrigerated and protected from sunlight and artificial light. Infusion must then be completed within 12 hours. Solutions must be used within these time periods or discarded. Doxycycline, when diluted with Ringer's Injection, or Invert Sugar, 10% in Water, or Normosol-M® in D5-W (Abbott), or Normosol- R® in D5-W (Abbott), or Plasma-Lyte® 56 in 5% Dextrose (Travenol), or Plasma-Lyte® 148 in 5% Dextrose (Travenol) to a concentration between 1 mg/mL and 0.1 mg/mL, must be completely infused within 12 hours after reconstitution to ensure adequate stability. During infusion, the solution must be protected from direct sunlight. Reconstituted solutions (1 to 0.1 mg/mL) may be stored up to 72 hours prior to start of infusion, if refrigerated and protected from sunlight and artificial light. Infusion must then be completed within 12 hours. Solutions must be used within these time periods or discarded. When diluted with Lactated Ringer's Injection, or Dextrose 5% in Lactated Ringer's, infusion of the solution (ca. 1 mg/mL) or lower concentrations (not less than 0.1 mg/mL) must be completed within six hours after reconstitution to ensure adequate stability. During infusion, the solution must be protected from direct sunlight. Solutions must be used within this time period or discarded. Solutions of doxycycline hyclate at a concentration of 10 mg/mL in Sterile Water for Injection, when frozen immediately after reconstitution are stable for 8 weeks when stored at –20°C. If the product is warmed, care should be taken to avoid heating it after the thawing is complete. Once thawed the solution should not be refrozen. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration whenever solution and container permit.</p>
