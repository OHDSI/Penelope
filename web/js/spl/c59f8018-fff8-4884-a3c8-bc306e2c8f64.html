<h1><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION
</span></h1>
<p class="First">Finasteride USP, a synthetic 4-azasteroid compound, is a specific inhibitor of steroid Type II 5α-reductase, an intracellular enzyme that converts the androgen testosterone into 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT).</p>
<p>Finasteride is 4-azaandrost-1-ene-17-carboxamide, <span class="Italics">N</span>-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-3-oxo-, (5α,17β)-.  The empirical formula of finasteride is C<span class="Sub">23</span>H<span class="Sub">36</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span> and its molecular weight is 372.55. Its structural formula is:</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</span></h1>
<p class="First">The development and enlargement of the prostate gland is dependent on the potent androgen, 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Type II 5α-reductase metabolizes testosterone to DHT in the prostate gland, liver and skin. DHT induces androgenic effects by binding to androgen receptors in the cell nuclei of these organs.</p>
<p>Finasteride is a competitive and specific inhibitor of Type II 5α-reductase with which it slowly forms a stable enzyme complex. Turnover from this complex is extremely slow (t<span class="Sub">½</span> ~ 30 days). This has been demonstrated both <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> and <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>. Finasteride has no affinity for the androgen receptor. In man, the 5α-reduced steroid metabolites in blood and urine are decreased after administration of finasteride.</p>
<p>In man, a single 5 mg oral dose of finasteride tablets USP produces a rapid reduction in serum DHT concentration, with the maximum effect observed 8 hours after the first dose. The suppression of DHT is maintained throughout the 24-hour dosing interval and with continued treatment. Daily dosing of finasteride tablets USP at 5 mg/day for up to 4 years has been shown to reduce the serum DHT concentration by approximately 70%. The median circulating level of testosterone increased by approximately 10 to 20% but remained within the physiologic range.</p>
<p>Adult males with genetically inherited Type II 5α-reductase deficiency also have decreased levels of DHT. Except for the associated urogenital defects present at birth, no other clinical abnormalities related to Type II 5α-reductase deficiency have been observed in these individuals. These individuals have a small prostate gland throughout life and do not develop BPH.</p>
<p>In patients with BPH treated with finasteride (1 to 100 mg/day) for 7 to 10 days prior to prostatectomy, an approximate 80% lower DHT content was measured in prostatic tissue removed at surgery, compared to placebo; testosterone tissue concentration was increased up to 10 times over pretreatment levels, relative to placebo. Intraprostatic content of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was also decreased.</p>
<p>In healthy male volunteers treated with finasteride tablets USP for 14 days, discontinuation of therapy resulted in a return of DHT levels to pretreatment levels in approximately 2 weeks. In patients treated for three months, prostate volume, which declined by approximately 20%, returned to close to baseline value after approximately three months of discontinuation of therapy.</p>

<h2><span class="Italics">Pharmacokinetics
</span></h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></p>
<p>In a study of 15 healthy young subjects, the mean bioavailability of finasteride 5 mg tablets was 63% (range 34 to 108 %), based on the ratio of area under the curve (AUC) relative to an intravenous (IV) reference dose. Maximum finasteride plasma concentration averaged 37 ng/mL (range, 27 to 49 ng/mL) and was reached 1 to 2 hours postdose. Bioavailability of finasteride was not affected by food.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></p>
<p>Mean steady-state volume of distribution was 76 liters (range, 44 to 96 liters). Approximately 90% of circulating finasteride is bound to plasma proteins. There is a slow accumulation phase for finasteride after multiple dosing. After dosing with 5 mg/day of finasteride for 17 days, plasma concentrations of finasteride were 47 and 54% higher than after the first dose in men  45 to 60 years old (n=12) and ≥70 years old (n=12), respectively. Mean trough concentrations after 17 days of dosing were 6.2 ng/mL (range, 2.4 to 9.8 ng/mL) and  8.1 ng/mL (range, 1.8 to 19.7 ng/mL), respectively, in the two age groups. Although steady state was not reached in this study, mean trough plasma concentration in another study in patients with BPH (mean age, 65 years) receiving 5 mg/day was 9.4 ng/mL (range, 7.1 to 13.3 ng/mL; n=22) after over a year of dosing.</p>
<p>Finasteride has been shown to cross the blood brain barrier but does not appear to distribute preferentially to the CSF.</p>
<p>In 2 studies of healthy subjects (n=69) receiving finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg/day for 6 to 24 weeks, finasteride concentrations in semen ranged from undetectable (&lt;0.1 ng/mL) to 10.54 ng/mL. In an earlier study using a less sensitive assay, finasteride concentrations in the semen of 16 subjects receiving finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg/day ranged from undetectable (&lt;1.0 ng/mL) to 21 ng/mL. Thus, based on a 5-mL ejaculate volume, the amount of finasteride in semen was estimated to be 50- to 100-fold less than the dose of finasteride (5 mcg) that had no effect on circulating DHT levels in men (see also <a href="#be2b789f-ba34-44e3-9d55-7079625663c3">PRECAUTIONS</a>, <span class="Italics"><a href="#bb47d560-eb12-4d4c-a430-f8510413e39e">Pregnancy</a></span>).</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p>
<p>Finasteride is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily via the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme subfamily. Two metabolites, the t-butyl side chain monohydroxylated and monocarboxylic acid metabolites, have been identified that possess no more than 20% of the 5α-reductase inhibitory activity of finasteride.</p>
<p><a name="b4098996-b1fb-4a76-bf39-c58972ac2c73"></a><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p>
<p>In healthy young subjects (n=15), mean plasma clearance of finasteride was 165 mL/min (range, 70 to 279 mL/min) and mean elimination half-life in plasma was 6 hours (range, 3 to 16 hours). Following an oral dose of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-finasteride in man (n=6), a mean of 39% (range, 32 to 46 %) of the dose was excreted in the urine in the form of metabolites; 57% (range, 51 to 64 %) was excreted in the feces.</p>
<p>The mean terminal half-life of finasteride in subjects ≥70 years of age was approximately 8 hours (range, 6 to 15 hours; n=12), compared with 6 hours (range, 4 to 12 hours; n=12) in subjects 45 to 60 years of age. As a result, mean AUC<span class="Sub">(0 to 24 hr)</span> after 17 days of dosing was 15% higher in subjects ≥70 years of age than in subjects 45 to 60 years of age (p=0.02).</p>

Urinary excretion of metabolites was decreased in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>. This decrease was associated with an increase in fecal excretion of metabolites. Plasma concentrations of metabolites were significantly higher in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (based on a 60% increase in total radioactivity AUC). However, finasteride has been well tolerated in BPH patients with normal renal function receiving up to 80 mg/day for 12 weeks, where exposure of these patients to metabolites would presumably be much greater.</p>

Caution should be used in the administration of  finasteride tablets USP  in those patients with liver function abnormalities, as finasteride is metabolized extensively in the liver.</p>

<p>No drug interactions of clinical importance have been identified. Finasteride does not appear to affect the cytochrome P450-linked drug metabolism enzyme system. Compounds that have been tested in man have included antipyrine, digoxin, propranolol, theophylline, and warfarin, and no clinically meaningful interactions were found.</p>

<p>Finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg/day was initially evaluated in patients with symptoms of BPH and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4093346" conceptname="Large prostate">enlarged prostates</span> by digital rectal examination in two 1-year, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind studies and their 5-year open extensions.</p>
<p>Finasteride tablets USP was further evaluated in a long-term efficacy and safety study, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 4-year, multicenter study. 3040 patients between the ages of 45 and 78, with moderate to severe symptoms of BPH and an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4093346" conceptname="Large prostate">enlarged prostate</span> upon digital rectal examination, were randomized into the study (1524 to finasteride, 1516 to placebo) and 3016 patients were evaluable for efficacy. 1883 patients completed the 4-year study (1000 in the finasteride group, 883 in the placebo group).</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Effect on Symptom Score</span></p>
<p>Symptoms were quantified using a score similar to the American Urological Association Symptom Score, which evaluated both obstructive symptoms (impairment of size and force of stream, sensation of incomplete bladder emptying, delayed or interrupted urination) and irritative symptoms (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="40304526" conceptname="Nocturia">nocturia</span>, daytime frequency, need to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span> or push the flow of urine) by rating on a 0 to 5 scale for six symptoms and a 0 to 4 scale for one symptom, for a total possible score of 34.</p>
<p>Patients in a long-term efficacy and safety study had moderate to severe symptoms at baseline (mean of approximately 15 points on a 0 to 34 point scale). Patients randomized to finasteride tablets USP who remained on therapy for 4 years had a mean (±1 SD) decrease in symptom score of 3.3 (± 5.8) points compared with 1.3 (± 5.6) points in the placebo group. (See Figure 1.) A statistically significant improvement in symptom score was evident at 1 year in patients treated with finasteride tablets USP vs. placebo (–2.3 vs –1.6), and this improvement continued through Year 4.</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="141a80d8-figure-02" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=c59f8018-fff8-4884-a3c8-bc306e2c8f64&amp;name=141a80d8-figure-02.jpg"></div>
<p>Results seen in earlier studies were comparable to those seen in a long-term efficacy and safety study. Although an early improvement in urinary symptoms was seen in some patients, a therapeutic trial of at least 6 months was generally necessary to assess whether a beneficial response in symptom relief had been achieved. The improvement in BPH symptoms was seen during the first year and maintained throughout an additional 5 years of open extension studies.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Effect on the Need for Surgery</span></p>
<p>In a long-term efficacy and safety study, efficacy was also assessed by evaluating treatment failures. Treatment failure was prospectively defined as BPH-related urological events or clinical deterioration, lack of improvement and/or the need for alternative therapy. BPH-related urological events were defined as urological <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4121697" conceptname="Surgery">surgical intervention</span>. Complete event information was available for 92% of the patients. The following table summarizes the results.</p>

<p>Compared with placebo, finasteride tablets USP was associated with a significantly lower need for BPH-related surgery. Compared with placebo, finasteride tablets USP was associated with a significantly lower risk for surgery [10.1% for placebo vs 4.6% for finasteride tablets USP; 55% reduction in risk, 95% CI: (37 to 68%)]; see Figure 2.</p>

<p><span class="Italics">Effect on Maximum Urinary Flow Rate</span></p>
<p>In the patients in a long-term efficacy and safety study who remained on therapy for the duration of the study and had evaluable urinary flow data, finasteride tablets USP increased maximum urinary flow rate by 1.9 mL/sec compared with 0.2 mL/sec in the placebo group.</p>
<p>There was a clear difference between treatment groups in maximum urinary flow rate in favor of finasteride tablets USP by month 4 (1.0 vs 0.3 mL/sec) which was maintained throughout the study. In the earlier 1-year studies, increase in maximum urinary flow rate was comparable to a long-term efficacy and safety study and was maintained through the first year and throughout an additional 5 years of open extension studies.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Effect on Prostate Volume</span></p>
<p>In a long-term efficacy and safety study, prostate volume was assessed yearly by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a subset of patients. In patients treated with finasteride tablets USP who remained on therapy, prostate volume was reduced compared with both baseline and placebo throughout the 4-year study.  Finasteride tablets USP decreased prostate volume by 17.9% (from 55.9 mL at baseline to 45.8 mL at 4 years) compared with an increase of 14.1% (from 51.3 mL to 58.5 mL) in the placebo group (p&lt;0.001). (See Figure 3.)</p>
<p>Results seen in earlier studies were comparable to those seen in a long-term efficacy and safety study. Mean prostate volume at baseline ranged between 40 to 50 mL. The reduction in prostate volume was seen during the first year and maintained throughout an additional five years of open extension studies.</p>

<p><span class="Italics">Prostate Volume as a Predictor of Therapeutic Response</span></p>
<p>A meta-analysis combining 1-year data from seven double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of similar design, including 4491 patients with symptomatic BPH, demonstrated that, in patients treated with finasteride tablets USP, the magnitude of symptom response and degree of improvement in maximum urinary flow rate were greater in patients with an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4093346" conceptname="Large prostate">enlarged prostate</span> at baseline.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Summary of Clinical Studies</span></p>
<p>The data from these studies, showing improvement in BPH-related symptoms, reduction in treatment failure (BPH-related urological events), increased maximum urinary flow rates, and decreasing prostate volume, suggest that finasteride tablets USP arrests the disease process of BPH in men with an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4093346" conceptname="Large prostate">enlarged prostate</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="Italics">General
</span></h2>
<p class="First">Prior to initiating therapy with finasteride tablets USP, appropriate evaluation should be performed to identify other conditions such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, prostate cancer, stricture disease, hypotonic bladder or other neurogenic disorders that might mimic BPH.</p>
<p>Patients with large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary flow should be carefully monitored for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194406" conceptname="Urinary tract obstruction">obstructive uropathy</span>. These patients may not be candidates for finasteride therapy.</p>
<p>Caution should be used in the administration of finasteride tablets USP in those patients with liver function abnormalities, as finasteride is metabolized extensively in the liver.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Effects on PSA and Prostate Cancer Detection</span></p>
<p>No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride tablets USP. Patients with BPH and elevated PSA were monitored in controlled clinical studies with serial PSAs and prostate biopsies. In these BPH studies, finasteride tablets USP did not appear to alter the rate of prostate cancer detection, and the overall incidence of prostate cancer was not significantly different in patients treated with finasteride tablets USP or placebo.</p>
<p>Finasteride tablets USP causes a decrease in serum PSA levels by approximately 50% in patients with BPH. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values, although it may vary in individual patients. Analysis of PSA data from over 3000 patients in a long-term efficacy and safety study confirmed that in typical patients treated with finasteride tablets USP for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. This adjustment preserves the sensitivity and specificity of the PSA assay and maintains its ability to detect prostate cancer. Finasteride tablets USP may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Any confirmed increases in PSA levels from nadir while on finasteride tablets USP may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be carefully evaluated, even if these values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non compliance with finasteride tablets USP therapy may also affect PSA test results.</p>
<p>Percent free PSA (free to total PSA ratio) is not significantly decreased by finasteride tablets USP. The ratio of free to total PSA remains constant even under the influence of finasteride tablets USP. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary.</p>

In healthy volunteers, treatment with finasteride tablets USP did not alter the response of LH and FSH to gonadotropin-releasing hormone indicating that the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis was not affected.</p>
<p>Treatment with finasteride tablets USP for 24 weeks to evaluate semen parameters in healthy male volunteers revealed no clinically meaningful effects on sperm concentration, mobility, morphology, or pH. A 0.6 mL (22.1%) median decrease in ejaculate volume with a concomitant reduction in total sperm per ejaculate was observed. These parameters remained within the normal range and were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy with an average time to return to baseline of 84 weeks.</p>

<h2><span class="Italics">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
</span></h2>
<p class="First">No evidence of a tumorigenic effect was observed in a 24-month study in Sprague-Dawley rats receiving doses of finasteride up to 160 mg/kg/day in males and 320 mg/kg/day in females. These doses produced respective systemic exposure in rats of 111 and 274 times those observed in man receiving the recommended human dose of 5 mg/day. All exposure calculations were based on calculated AUC <span class="Sub">(0 to 24 hr)</span> for animals and mean AUC <span class="Sub">(0 to 24 hr)</span> for man (0.4 mcg•hr/mL).</p>
<p>In a 19-month carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, a statistically significant (p≤0.05) increase in the incidence of testicular Leydig cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> was observed at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (228 times the human exposure). In mice at a dose of 25 mg/kg/day (23 times the human exposure, estimated) and in rats at a dose of ≥40 mg/kg/day (39 times the human exposure) an increase in the incidence of Leydig cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4296894" conceptname="Hyperplasia">hyperplasia</span> was observed. A positive correlation between the proliferative changes in the Leydig cells and an increase in serum LH levels (2- to 3-fold above control) has been demonstrated in both rodent species treated with high doses of finasteride. No drug-related Leydig cell changes were seen in either rats or dogs treated with finasteride for 1 year at doses of 20 mg/kg/day and 45 mg/kg/day (30 and 350 times, respectively, the human exposure) or in mice treated for 19 months at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day (2.3 times the human exposure, estimated).</p>
<p>No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> bacterial mutagenesis assay, a mammalian cell mutagenesis assay, or in an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> alkaline elution assay. In an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> chromosome aberration assay, using Chinese hamster ovary cells, there was a slight increase in chromosome aberrations. These concentrations correspond to 4000 to 5000 times the peak plasma levels in man given a total dose of 5 mg. In an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> chromosome aberration assay in mice, no treatment-related increase in chromosome aberration was observed with finasteride at the maximum tolerated dose of 250 mg/kg/day (228 times the human exposure) as determined in the carcinogenicity studies.</p>
<p>In sexually mature male rabbits treated with finasteride at 80 mg/kg/day (543 times the human exposure) for up to 12 weeks, no effect on fertility, sperm count, or ejaculate volume was seen. In sexually mature male rats treated with 80 mg/kg/day of finasteride (61 times the human exposure), there were no significant effects on fertility after 6 or 12 weeks of treatment; however, when treatment was continued for up to 24 or 30 weeks, there was an apparent decrease in fertility, fecundity and an associated significant decrease in the weights of the seminal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443720" conceptname="Blister">vesicles</span> and prostate. All these effects were reversible within 6 weeks of discontinuation of treatment. No drug-related effect on testes or on mating performance has been seen in rats or rabbits. This decrease in fertility in finasteride-treated rats is secondary to its effect on accessory sex organs (prostate and seminal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443720" conceptname="Blister">vesicles</span>) resulting in failure to form a seminal plug. The seminal plug is essential for normal fertility in rats and is not relevant in man.</p>

<p>Finasteride tablets USP are not indicated for use in women.</p>
<p>Administration of finasteride to pregnant rats at doses ranging from 100 mcg/kg/day to 100 mg/kg/day (1 to 1000 times the recommended human dose of 5 mg/day) resulted in dose-dependent development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196528" conceptname="Hypospadias">hypospadias</span> in 3.6 to 100% of male offspring. Pregnant rats produced male offspring with decreased prostatic and seminal vesicular weights, delayed preputial separation and transient nipple development when given finasteride at ≥30 mcg/kg/day (≥3/10 of the recommended human dose of 5 mg/day) and decreased anogenital distance when given finasteride at ≥3 mcg/kg/day (≥3/100 of the recommended human dose of 5 mg/day). The critical period during which these effects can be induced in male rats has been defined to be days 16 to 17 of gestation. The changes described above are expected pharmacological effects of drugs belonging to the class of Type II 5α-reductase inhibitors and are similar to those reported in male infants with a genetic deficiency of Type II 5α-reductase. No abnormalities were observed in female offspring exposed to any dose of finasteride <span class="Italics">in utero</span>.</p>
<p>No developmental abnormalities have been observed in first filial generation (F<span class="Sub">1</span>) male or female offspring resulting from mating finasteride-treated male rats (80 mg/kg/day; 61 times the human exposure) with untreated females. Administration of finasteride at 3 mg/kg/day (30 times the recommended human dose of 5 mg/day) during the late gestation and lactation period resulted in slightly decreased fertility in F<span class="Sub">1</span> male offspring. No effects were seen in female offspring. No evidence of malformations has been observed in rabbit fetuses exposed to finasteride <span class="Italics">in utero</span> from days 6 to 18 of gestation at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (1000 times the recommended human dose of 5 mg/day). However, effects on male genitalia would not be expected since the rabbits were not exposed during the critical period of genital system development.</p>
<p>The <span class="Italics">in utero</span> effects of finasteride exposure during the period of embryonic and fetal development were evaluated in the rhesus monkey (gestation days 20 to 100), a species more predictive of human development than rats or rabbits. Intravenous administration of finasteride to pregnant monkeys at doses as high as 800 ng/day (at least 60 to 120 times the highest estimated exposure of pregnant women to finasteride from semen of men taking 5 mg/day) resulted in no abnormalities in male fetuses. In confirmation of the relevance of the rhesus model for human fetal development, oral administration of a dose of finasteride (2 mg/kg/day; 20 times the recommended human dose of 5 mg/day or approximately 1 to 2 million times the highest estimated exposure to finasteride from semen of men taking 5 mg/day) to pregnant monkeys resulted in external genital abnormalities in male fetuses. No other abnormalities were observed in male fetuses and no finasteride-related abnormalities were observed in female fetuses at any dose.</p>

<p>The adverse experience profile in the 1-year, placebo-controlled, Phase III studies, the 5-year open extensions, and a long-term efficacy and safety study were similar.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Long-Term Data</span></p>
<p>There is no evidence of increased adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride tablets USP. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy.</p>
<p>During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 4-year, placebo-controlled long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men, but no cases were reported in men treated with finasteride. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown.</p>
<p>In a 7-year placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 healthy men, 9060 had prostate needle biopsy data available for analysis. In the finasteride tablets USP group, 280 (6.4%) men had prostate cancer with Gleason scores of 7 to 10 detected on needle biopsy vs. 237 (5.1%) men in the placebo group. Of the total cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in this study, approximately 98% were classified as intracapsular (stage T1 or T2). The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. This information from the literature (Thompson IM, Goodman PJ, Tangen CM, et al. The influence of finasteride on the development of prostate cancer. <span class="Italics">N Engl J Med</span> 2003;349:213-22) is provided for consideration by physicians when finasteride tablets USP are used as indicated (see <a href="#b96a6ae9-cfe0-4183-99c0-34c7f9df4c01">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</a>).  Finasteride tablets USP are not approved to reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">What is BPH? </span></p>
<p>BPH is an enlargement of the prostate gland. The prostate is located below the bladder. As the prostate enlarges, it may slowly restrict the flow of urine. This can lead to symptoms such as:</p>
<ul class="Disc">
<li>a weak or interrupted urinary stream</li>
<li>a feeling that you cannot empty your bladder completely</li>
<li>a feeling of delay or hesitation when you start to urinate</li>
<li>a need to urinate often, especially at night</li>
<li>a feeling that you must urinate right away.</li>
</ul>
<p>In some men, BPH can lead to serious problems, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="81902" conceptname="Urinary tract infectious disease">urinary tract infections</span>, as well as the need for surgery.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What finasteride tablets USP does </span></p>
<p>Finasteride tablets USP lowers levels of a hormone called DHT (dihydrotestosterone), which is a cause of prostate growth. Lowering DHT leads to shrinkage of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4093346" conceptname="Large prostate">enlarged prostate</span> gland in most men. This can lead to gradual improvement in urine flow and symptoms over the next several months.

However, since each case of BPH is different, you should know that:</p>
<ul class="Disc">
<li>Even though the prostate shrinks, you may NOT notice an improvement in urine flow or symptoms.</li>
<li>You may need to take finasteride tablets USP for six (6) months or more to see whether it improves your symptoms.</li>
<li>Therapy with finasteride tablets USP may reduce the need for surgery for an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4093346" conceptname="Large prostate">enlarged prostate</span>.</li>
