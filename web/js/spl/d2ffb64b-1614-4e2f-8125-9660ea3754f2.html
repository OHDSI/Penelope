<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Like other topical corticosteroids, fluocinolone acetonide has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A<span class="Sub">2</span> inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A<span class="Sub">2</span>.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusion of topical corticosteroids can enhance penetration. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Also, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> and/or other disease processes in the skin can increase percutaneous absorption.</p>
<p>DermOtic<span class="Sup">®</span> Oil is in the low to medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First">Efficacy in a placebo-controlled study for the treatment of chronic eczematous external <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4183452" conceptname="Otitis">otitis</span> on 154 patients (adults and children 2 years of age and older) treated with five drops per ear of DermOtic<span class="Sup">®</span> Oil twice daily, after 7 days of treatment, showed DermOtic<span class="Sup">®</span> Oil to be superior to placebo in clearing the signs and symptoms of eczematous external <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4183452" conceptname="Otitis">otitis</span>. </p>
<p>Clinical safety studies were conducted on the same formulation of fluocinolone acetonide oil 0.01%, marketed as Derma-Smoothe/FS<span class="Sup">®</span> Topical Oil. Open-label safety studies on 33 children (20 subjects ages 2 to 6 years, 13 subjects ages 7 to 12 years) with moderate to severe stable <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133834" conceptname="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</span>, and baseline body surface area involvement greater than 75% in 18 patients, and 50% to 75% in 15 patients, were treated with Derma-Smoothe/FS<span class="Sup">®</span> Topical Oil twice daily for 4 weeks. Morning pre-stimulation cortisol level and post-Cortrosyn stimulation cortisol level were obtained in each subject at the beginning of the trial and at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. At the end of treatment, 4 out of 18 subjects aged 2 to 5 years showed low pre-stimulation cortisol levels (3.2 to 6.6µg/dL; normal: cortisol &gt; 7µg/dL) but all had normal responses to 0.25 mg of Cortrosyn stimulation (cortisol &gt; 18µg/dL).</p>
<p>A clinical study was conducted to assess the safety of Derma-Smoothe/FS<span class="Sup">®</span> Topical Oil, which contains refined peanut oil, on subjects with known peanut allergies. The study enrolled 13 patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133834" conceptname="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</span>, 6 to 17 years of age. Of the 13 patients, 9 were Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST) positive to peanuts and 4 had no peanut sensitivity (controls). The study evaluated the responses to both prick test and patch test utilizing peanut oil NF, Derma-Smoothe/FS<span class="Sup">® </span>Topical Oil and histamine/saline controls on the 13 individuals. These subjects were also treated with Derma-Smoothe/FS<span class="Sup">®</span> Topical Oil twice daily for 7 days. Prick test and patch test results for all 13 patients were negative to Derma-Smoothe/FS<span class="Sup">® </span>Topical Oil and the refined peanut oil. One of the 9 peanut-sensitive patients experienced an exacerbation of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133834" conceptname="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</span> after 5 days of Derma-Smoothe/FS Topical Oil use. Importantly, the bulk peanut oil NF, used in Derma-Smoothe/FS<span class="Sup">®</span> Topical Oil is heated at 475<span class="Sup">°</span> F for at least 15 minutes, which should provide for adequate decomposition of allergenic proteins.</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34072-9">
<a name="section-7.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span>, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on treatment.</p>
<p>Patients applying a topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. This may be done by using the ACTH stimulation, A.M. plasma cortisol, and urinary free cortisol tests.</p>
<p>If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid.  Infrequently, signs and symptoms of glucocorticoid insufficiency may occur requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. For information on systemic supplementation, see prescribing information for those products.</p>
<p>Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> ratios. (See <a href="#P_Pediatric">PRECAUTIONS-Pediatric use</a>)</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134438" conceptname="Contact dermatitis">Allergic contact dermatitis</span> to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation, which may occur with most topical products not containing corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic testing. One peanut-sensitive child experienced a flare of his <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133834" conceptname="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</span> after 5 days of twice daily treatment with Derma-Smoothe/FS<span class="Sup">®</span> Topical Oil (see <a href="#CS">CLINICAL STUDIES</a> section).</p>
<p>If wheal and flare type reactions (which may be limited to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span>) or other manifestations of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> develop, DermOtic<span class="Sup">®</span> Oil should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy instituted.</p>
<p>If concomitant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201093" conceptname="Infection of skin AND/OR subcutaneous tissue">skin infections</span> are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of DermOtic<span class="Sup">®</span> Oil should be discontinued until the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> has been adequately controlled.</p>
<p>DermOtic<span class="Sup">®</span> Oil is formulated with 48% refined peanut oil NF. Peanut oil used in this product is routinely tested for peanut proteins through amino acid analysis; the quantity of amino acids is below 0.5 parts per million (ppm). Physicians should use caution in prescribing DermOtic<span class="Sup">®</span> Oil for peanut-sensitive individuals.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential or the effect on fertility of DermOtic<span class="Sup">®</span> Oil. Studies have not been performed to evaluate the mutagenic potential of fluocinolone acetonide, the active ingredient in DermOtic<span class="Sup">®</span> Oil. Some corticosteroids have been found to be genotoxic in various genotoxicity tests (i.e. the in vitro human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay with metabolic activation, the in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay, the Chinese hamster micronucleus test and the in vitro mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> gene mutation assay).</p>

<h3>Teratogenic effects</h3>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-7.5.1.1"></a><p></p>
<h4>Pregnancy category C</h4>
<p class="First">Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals.</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from DermOtic<span class="Sup">®</span> Oil. Therefore, DermOtic<span class="Sup">®</span> Oil should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34080-2">
<a name="section-7.6"></a><p></p>
<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when DermOtic<span class="Sup">®</span> Oil is administered to a nursing woman.</p>

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">DermOtic<span class="Sup">®</span> Oil may be used twice daily for up to 2 weeks in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older with chronic eczematous external <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4183452" conceptname="Otitis">otitis</span>.</p>
<p>DermOtic<span class="Sup">®</span> Oil is not recommended for use on the face (See <a href="#AR">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a> section).</p>
<p>Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span>, children are at a greater risk than adults of HPA-axis-suppression when they are treated with topical corticosteroids. They are therefore also at greater risk of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment and of Cushing's syndrome while on treatment. Adverse effects including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137054" conceptname="Skin striae">striae</span> have been reported with inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids in infants and children. (See <a href="#PRECAUTIONS">PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>
<p>HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154803" conceptname="Raised intracranial pressure">intracranial hypertension</span> have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> ratios.
