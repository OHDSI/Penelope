<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Lorazepam, a benzodiazepine with antianxiety, sedative, and
                            anticonvulsant effects, is intended for the intramuscular or intravenous
                            routes of administration. It has the chemical formula:
                                7-chloro-5(2-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-3-hydroxy-2<span class="Italics">H</span>-1,<br>4-benzodiazepin-2-one. The
                            molecular weight is 321.16, and the C.A.S. No. is <br>[846-49-1]. The
                            structural formula is:</p>

<p>Lorazepam is a nearly white powder almost insoluble in water.
                            Each mL of sterile injection contains either 2.0 or 4.0 mg of lorazepam,
                            0.18 mL polyethylene glycol 400 in propylene glycol with 2.0% benzyl
                            alcohol as preservative.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Lorazepam interacts with the Î³-aminobutyric acid
                            (GABA)-benzodiazepine receptor complex, which is widespread in the brain
                            of humans as well as other species. This interaction is presumed to be
                            responsible for lorazepamâ€™s mechanism of action. Lorazepam exhibits
                            relatively high and specific affinity for its recognition site but does
                            not displace GABA. Attachment to the specific binding site enhances the
                            affinity of GABA for its receptor site on the same receptor complex. The
                            pharmacodynamic consequences of benzodiazepine agonist actions include
                            antianxiety effects, sedation, and reduction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> activity. The
                            intensity of action is directly related to the degree of benzodiazepine
                            receptor occupancy.</p>

<h2>Effects in Pre-Operative Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Intravenous or intramuscular administration of the
                                    recommended dose of 2 mg to 4 mg of Lorazepam Injection to adult
                                    patients is followed by dose-related effects of sedation
                                    (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>), relief of preoperative <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, and
                                    lack of recall of events related to the day of surgery in the
                                    majority of patients. The clinical sedation (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> or
                                    <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>) thus noted is such that the majority of patients are
                                    able to respond to simple instructions whether they give the
                                    appearance of being awake or asleep. The lack of recall is
                                    relative rather than absolute, as determined under conditions of
                                    careful patient questioning and testing, using props designed to
                                    enhance recall. The majority of patients under these reinforced
                                    conditions had difficulty recalling perioperative events or
                                    recognizing props from before surgery. The lack of recall and
                                    recognition was optimum within 2 hours following intramuscular
                                    administration and 15 to 20 minutes after intravenous
                                    injection.</p>
<p>The intended effects of the recommended adult dose of
                                    Lorazepam Injection usually last 6 to 8 hours. In rare
                                    instances, and where patients received greater than the
                                    recommended dose, excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> and prolonged lack of
                                    recall were noted. As with other benzodiazepines, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4046907" conceptname="Dysequilibrium syndrome">unsteadiness</span>,
                                    enhanced sensitivity to CNS-depressant effects of ethyl alcohol
                                    and other drugs were noted in isolated and rare cases for
                                    greater than 24 hours.</p>

<h2>Physiologic Effects in Healthy Adults</h2>
<p class="First">Studies in healthy adult volunteers reveal that
                                    intravenous lorazepam in doses up to 3.5 mg/70 kg does not alter
                                    sensitivity to the respiratory stimulating effect of carbon
                                    dioxide and does not enhance the respiratory-depressant effects
                                    of doses of meperidine up to 100 mg/70 kg (also determined by
                                    <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135927" conceptname="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</span> challenge) as long as patients remain
                                    sufficiently awake to undergo testing. Upper airway obstruction
                                    has been observed in rare instances where the patient received
                                    greater than the recommended dose and was excessively <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepy</span> and
                                    difficult to arouse (see <a href="#i4i_warnings_id_1e5d7f8d-2a77-46ce-aea1-53cc2147cd23">WARNINGS</a> and <a href="#i4i_adverse_effects_id_1da89e03-3427-4133-946e-27a38ca76434">ADVERSE
                                    REACTIONS</a>).</p>
<p>Clinically employed doses of Lorazepam Injection do not
                                    greatly affect the circulatory system in the supine position or
                                    employing a 70-degree tilt test. Doses of 8 mg to 10 mg of
                                    intravenous lorazepam (2 to 2-1/2 times the maximum recommended
                                    dosage) will produce loss of lid reflexes within 15
                                    minutes.</p>
<p>Studies in 6 healthy young adults who received lorazepam
                                    injection and no other drugs revealed that visual tracking (the
                                    ability to keep a moving line centered) was impaired for a mean
                                    of 8 hours following administration of 4 mg of intramuscular
                                    lorazepam and 4 hours following administration of 2 mg
                                    intramuscularly with considerable subject variation. Similar
                                    findings were noted with pentobarbital, 150 and 75 mg. Although
                                    this study showed that both lorazepam and pentobarbital
                                    interfered with eye-hand coordination, the data are insufficient
                                    to predict when it would be safe to operate a motor vehicle or
                                    engage in a hazardous occupation or sport.</p>

<h4>Intravenous</h4>
<p class="First">A 4-mg dose provides an initial
                                                  concentration of approximately 70

<h4>Intramuscular</h4>
<p class="First">Following intramuscular administration,
                                                  lorazepam is completely and rapidly absorbed
                                                  reaching peak concentrations within 3 hours. A
                                                  4-mg dose provides a C<span class="Sub">max</span> of
                                                  approximately 48 ng/mL. Following administration
                                                  of 1.5 to 5.0 mg of lorazepam IM, the amount of
                                                  lorazepam delivered to the circulation is
                                                  proportional to the dose administered.</p>

<h3>Distribution/Metabolism/Elimination</h3>
<p class="First">At clinically relevant concentrations, lorazepam
                                            is 91Â±2% bound to plasma proteins; its volume of
                                            distribution is approximately 1.3 L/kg. Unbound
                                            lorazepam penetrates the blood/brain barrier freely by
                                            passive diffusion, a fact confirmed by CSF sampling.
                                            Following parenteral administration, the terminal
                                            half-life and total clearance averaged 14Â±5 hours and
                                            1.1Â±0.4 mL/min/kg, respectively.</p>
<p>Lorazepam is extensively conjugated to the
                                            3-O-phenolic glucuronide in the liver and is known to
                                            undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Lorazepam
                                            glucuronide is an inactive metabolite and is eliminated
                                            mainly by the kidneys.</p>
<p>Following a single 2-mg oral dose of
                                                <span class="Sup">14</span>C-lorazepam to 8 healthy subjects,
                                            88Â±4% of the administered dose was recovered in urine
                                            and 7Â±2% was recovered in feces. The percent of
                                            administered dose recovered in urine as lorazepam
                                            glucuronide was 74Â±4%. Only 0.3% of the dose was
                                            recovered as unchanged lorazepam, and the remainder of
                                            the radioactivity represented minor
                                            metabolites.</p>

<h3>Patients With <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span></h3>
<p class="First">Because the kidney is the primary route of

                                            would be expected to compromise its clearance. This
                                            should have no direct effect on the glucuronidation (and
                                            inactivation) of lorazepam. There is a possibility that
                                            the enterohepatic circulation of lorazepam glucuronide
                                            leads to a reduced efficiency of the net clearance of
                                            lorazepam in this population.</p>
<p>Six normal subjects, six patients with renal
                                            impairment (Cl<span class="Sub">cr</span> of 22Â±9 mL/min), and four
                                            patients on chronic maintenance hemodialysis were given
                                            single 1.5 to 3.0 mg intravenous doses of lorazepam.
                                            Mean volume of distribution and terminal half-life
                                            values of lorazepam were 40% and 25% higher,
                                            respectively, in renally impaired patients than in
                                            normal subjects. Both parameters were 75% higher in
                                            patients undergoing hemodialysis than in normal
                                            subjects. Overall, though, in this group of subjects the
                                            mean total clearance of lorazepam did not change. About
                                            8% of the administered intravenous dose was removed as
                                            intact lorazepam during the 6-hour dialysis
                                            session.</p>
<p>The kinetics of lorazepam glucuronide were
                                            markedly affected by renal dysfunction. The mean
                                            terminal half-life was prolonged by 55% and 125% in
                                            renally impaired patients and patients under
                                            hemodialysis, respectively, as compared to normal
                                            subjects. The mean metabolic clearance decreased by 75%
                                            and 90% in renally impaired patients and patients under
                                            hemodialysis, respectively, as compared with normal
                                            subjects. About 40% of the administered lorazepam
                                            intravenous dose was removed as glucuronide conjugate
                                            during the 6-hour dialysis session.</p>

                                    between 18 and 65 years of age. More than half the patients in

                                    with simple partial and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4043559" conceptname="Complex partial status epilepticus">complex partial status epilepticus</span>
                                    comprised the rest of the population studied, along with a
                                    smaller number of patients who had absence status.</p>
<p>One study (n=58) was a double-blind active-control trial
                                    comparing Lorazepam Injection and diazepam. Patients were
                                    randomized to receive lorazepam 2 mg IV (with an additional 2 mg
                                    IV if needed) or diazepam 5 mg IV (with an additional 5 mg IV if
                                    needed). The primary outcome measure was a comparison of the
                                    proportion of responders in each treatment group, where a
                                    responder was defined as a patient whose <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> stopped within
                                    10 minutes after treatment and who continued <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span>-free for at
                                    least an additional 30 minutes. Twenty-four of the 30 (80%)
                                    patients were deemed responders to lorazepam and 16/28 (57%)
                                    patients were deemed responders to diazepam (p=0.04). Of the 24
                                    lorazepam responders, 23 received both 2 mg
                                    infusions.</p>
<p>Non-responders to lorazepam 4 mg were given an additional
                                    2 to 4 mg lorazepam; <br>non-responders to diazepam 10 mg were
                                    given an additional 5 to 10 mg diazepam. After this additional
                                    dose administration, 28/30 (93%) of patients randomized to
                                    lorazepam and 24/28 (86%) of patients randomized to diazepam
                                    were deemed responders, a difference that was not statistically
                                    significant.</p>
<p>Although this study provides support for the efficacy of
                                    lorazepam as the treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span>, it cannot
                                    speak reliably or meaningfully to the comparative performance of
                                    either diazepam (Valium) or lorazepam (Lorazepam Injection)
                                    under the conditions of actual use.</p>
<p>A second study (n=119) was a double-blind dose-comparison
                                    trial with 3 doses of Lorazepam Injection: 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg.
                                    Patients were randomized to receive one of the three doses of
                                    lorazepam. The primary outcome and definition of responder were
                                    as in the first study. Twenty-five of 41 patients (61%)
                                    responded to 1 mg lorazepam; 21/37 patients (57%) responded to 2
                                    mg lorazepam; and 31/41 (76%) responded to 4 mg lorazepam. The
                                    p-value for a statistical test of the difference between the
                                    lorazepam 4 mg dose group and the lorazepam 1 mg dose group was
                                    0.08 (two-sided). Data from all randomized patients were used in
                                    this test.</p>
<p>Although analyses failed to detect an effect of age, sex,
                                    or race on the effectiveness of lorazepam in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span>,
                                    the numbers of patients evaluated were too few to allow a

<h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Lorazepam Injection is contraindicated in patients with a known
                            sensitivity to benzodiazepines or its vehicle (polyethylene glycol,
                            propylene glycol, and benzyl alcohol), in patients with acute

                            Lorazepam Injection intra-arterially is contraindicated because, as with
                            other injectable benzodiazepines, inadvertent intra-arterial injection

<h3>Management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">Status Epilepticus</span></h3>
<p class="First"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">Status epilepticus</span> is a potentially
                                            life-threatening condition associated with a high risk
                                            of permanent neurological impairment, if inadequately
                                            treated. The treatment of status, however, requires far
                                            more than the administration of an anticonvulsant agent.
                                            It involves observation and management of all parameters
                                            critical to maintaining vital function and the capacity
                                            to provide support of those functions as required.
                                            Ventilatory support must be readily available. The use
                                            of benzodiazepines, like Lorazepam Injection, is
                                            ordinarily only one step of a complex and sustained
                                            intervention which may require additional interventions
                                            (e.g., concomitant intravenous administration of
                                            phenytoin). Because <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span> may result from a
                                            correctable acute cause such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>,

                                            such an abnormality must be immediately sought and
                                            corrected. Furthermore, patients who are susceptible to
                                            further <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> episodes should receive adequate

<p>For the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span>, the
                                            usual recommended dose of Lorazepam Injection is 4 mg
                                            given slowly (2 mg/min) for patients 18 years and older.
                                            If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> cease, no additional Lorazepam Injection is
                                            required. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> continue or recur after a 10- to

<p>Patients who receive Lorazepam Injection as a premedicant
                                    should be cautioned that driving a motor vehicle, operating
                                    machinery, or engaging in hazardous or other activities

<h3>Lorazepam-Valproate Interaction</h3>
<p class="First">Concurrent administration of lorazepam (2 mg
                                            intravenously) with valproate (250 mg twice daily orally

                                            decreased total clearance of lorazepam by 40% and
                                            decreased formation rate of lorazepam glucuronide by
                                            55%, as compared with lorazepam administered alone.
                                            Accordingly, lorazepam plasma concentrations were about
                                            two-fold higher for at least 12 hours post-dose
                                            administration during valproate treatment. Lorazepam
                                            dosage should be reduced to 50% of the normal adult dose
                                            when this drug combination is prescribed in patients

<h3>Lorazepam-Oral Contraceptive Steroids Interaction</h3>
<p class="First">Coadministration of lorazepam (2 mg

                                            associated with a 55% decrease in half-life, a 50%
                                            increase in the volume of distribution, thereby
                                            resulting in an almost 3.7-fold increase in total
                                            clearance of lorazepam as compared with control healthy
                                            females (n=8). It may be necessary to increase the dose

<h3>Lorazepam-Probenecid Interaction</h3>
<p class="First">Concurrent administration of lorazepam (2 mg
                                            intravenously) with probenecid (500 mg orally every 6
                                            hours) to 9 healthy volunteers resulted in a
                                            prolongation of lorazepam half-life by 130% and a
                                            decrease in its total clearance by 45%. No change in
                                            volume of distribution was noted during probenecid
                                            co-treatment. Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of lorazepam generally were not adequate
                                    to determine whether subjects aged 65 and over respond
                                    differently than younger subjects; however, age over 65 may be
                                    associated with a greater incidence of central nervous system

<p>Age does not appear to have a clinically significant
                                    effect on lorazepam kinetics (see <a href="#i4i_clinical_pharmacology_id_07632c84-b258-4cf2-b6a5-cf919bc71314">CLINICAL
                                        PHARMACOLOGY</a>). </p>
<p>Clinical circumstances, some of which may be more common
                                    in the elderly, such as hepatic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, should be
                                    considered. Greater sensitivity (e.g., sedation) of some older
                                    individuals cannot be ruled out. In general, dose selection for
                                    an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the
                                    low end of the dosing range (see <a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_bd63bc0c-ae0c-498f-9605-66b74050c418">DOSAGE AND

<h3>Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials</h3>
<p class="First">All adverse events were recorded during the
                                            trials by the clinical investigators using terminology
                                            of their own choosing. Similar types of events were
                                            grouped into standardized categories using modified
                                            COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are
                                            used in the table and listings below with the
                                            frequencies representing the proportion of individuals
                                            exposed to Lorazepam Injection or to comparative
                                            therapy.</p>
<p>The prescriber should be aware that these figures
                                            cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse
                                            events in the course of usual medical practice where
                                            patient characteristics and other factors may differ
                                            from those prevailing during clinical studies.
                                            Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly
                                            compared with figures obtained from other clinical
                                            investigators involving different treatment, uses, or
                                            investigators. An inspection of these frequencies,
                                            however, does provide the prescribing physician with one
                                            basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and
                                            nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the
                                            population studied.</p>

                                            with injectable lorazepam is central-nervous-system
                                            <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>. The incidence varied from one study to
                                            another, depending on the dosage, route of
                                            administration, use of other central-nervous-system
                                            depressants, and the investigatorâ€™s opinion concerning
                                            the degree and duration of desired sedation. Excessive
                                            <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> were the most common
                                            consequences of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span>. This interfered with
                                            patient cooperation in approximately 6% (25/446) of
                                            patients undergoing regional anesthesia, causing
                                            difficulty in assessing levels of anesthesia. Patients
                                            over 50 years of age had a higher incidence of excessive
                                            <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> when compared with those under
                                            50 (21/106 versus 24/245) when lorazepam was given
                                            intravenously (see <a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_bd63bc0c-ae0c-498f-9605-66b74050c418">DOSAGE AND
                                                ADMINISTRATION</a>). On rare occasion
                                            (3/1580) the patient was unable to give personal
                                            identification in the operating room on arrival, and one
                                            patient fell when attempting premature ambulation in the
                                            postoperative period.</p>

                                            about 1.3% (20/1580). One patient injured himself by
                                            picking at his incision during the immediate
                                            postoperative period.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">Hallucinations</span> were present in about 1% (14/1580)
                                            of patients and were visual and
                                            self-limiting.</p>
<p>An occasional patient complained of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>,

                                            infrequently reported during the peak-effect
                                            period.</p>
<p>An occasional patient had a prolonged recovery
                                            room stay, either because of excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> or
                                            because of some form of inappropriate behavior. The
                                            latter was seen most commonly when scopolamine was given
                                            concomitantly as a premedicant. Limited information
                                            derived from patients who were discharged the day after
                                            receiving injectable lorazepam showed one patient
                                            complained of some <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4046907" conceptname="Dysequilibrium syndrome">unsteadiness</span> of gait and a reduced
                                            ability to perform complex mental functions. Enhanced
                                            sensitivity to alcoholic beverages has been reported
                                            more than 24 hours after receiving injectable lorazepam,
                                            similar to experience with other

<h3>Local Effects</h3>
<p class="First">Intramuscular injection of lorazepam has resulted
                                            in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> at the injection site, a sensation of burning,
                                            or observed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">redness</span> in the same area in a very variable
                                            incidence from one study to another. The overall
                                            incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> and burning in patients was about 17%
                                            (146/859) in the immediate postinjection period and
                                            about 1.4% (12/859) at the 24-hour observation time.
                                            Reactions at the injection site (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">redness</span>) occurred in
                                            approximately 2% (17/859) in the immediate postinjection
                                            period and were present 24 hours later in about 0.8%
                                            (7/859).</p>
<p>Intravenous administration of lorazepam resulted
                                            in painful responses in 13/771 patients or approximately
                                            1.6% in the immediate postinjection period, and 24 hours
                                            later 4/771 patients or about 0.5% still complained of

                                            intravenous injection but was noted in 19/771 patients
                                            at the 24-hour observation period. This incidence is
                                            similar to that observed with an intravenous infusion
                                            before lorazepam is given. Intra-arterial injection may
                                            produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4292397" conceptname="Arteriospasm">arteriospasm</span> resulting in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439928" conceptname="Gangrenous disorder">gangrene</span> which may

                                            This was believed due to excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> at the

<h2>Treatment</h2>
<p class="First">Treatment of overdosage is mainly supportive until the
                                    drug is eliminated from the body. Vital signs and fluid balance
                                    should be carefully monitored in conjunction with close
                                    observation of the patient. An adequate airway should be
                                    maintained and assisted respiration used as needed. With
                                    normally functioning kidneys, forced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span> with intravenous
                                    fluids and electrolytes may accelerate elimination of
                                    benzodiazepines from the body. In addition, osmotic diuretics,
                                    such as mannitol, may be effective as adjunctive measures. In
                                    more critical situations, renal dialysis and exchange blood
                                    transfusions may be indicated. Lorazepam does not appear to be
                                    removed in significant quantities by dialysis, although
                                    lorazepam glucuronide may be highly dialyzable. The value of
                                    dialysis has not been adequately determined for
                                    lorazepam.</p>
<p>The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil may be used in
                                    hospitalized patients as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for,

<h3>General Advice</h3>
<p class="First"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">Status epilepticus</span> is a potentially
                                            life-threatening condition associated with a high risk
                                            of permanent neurological impairment, if inadequately
                                            treated. The treatment of status, however, requires far
                                            more than the administration of an anticonvulsant agent.
                                            It involves observation and management of all parameters
                                            critical to maintaining vital function and the capacity
                                            to provide support of those functions as required.
                                            Ventilatory support must be readily available. The use
                                            of benzodiazepines, like Lorazepam Injection, is
                                            ordinarily only an initial step of a complex and
                                            sustained intervention which may require additional
                                            interventions, (e.g., concomitant intravenous
                                            administration of phenytoin). Because <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span>
                                            may result from a correctable acute cause such as

                                            sought and corrected. Furthermore, patients who are
                                            susceptible to further <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> episodes should receive
                                            adequate maintenance antiepileptic therapy.</p>

<h3>Intramuscular Injection</h3>
<p class="First">For the designated indications as a premedicant,
                                            the usual recommended dose of lorazepam for
                                            intramuscular injection is 0.05 mg/kg up to a maximum of
                                            4 mg. As with all premedicant drugs, the dose should be

                                            (0.044 mg/kg), whichever is smaller. This dose will
                                            suffice for sedating most adult patients and ordinarily
                                            should not be exceeded in patients over 50 years of age.
                                            In those patients in whom a greater likelihood of lack
                                            of recall for perioperative events would be beneficial,
                                            larger doses as high as 0.05 mg/kg up to a total of 4 mg

<h3>Dose Adjustment Due to Drug Interactions</h3>
<p class="First">The dose of lorazepam should be reduced by 50%

<h2>Administration</h2>
<p class="First">When given intramuscularly, Lorazepam Injection,
                                    undiluted, should be injected deep in the muscle
                                    <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span>.</p>
<p>Injectable lorazepam can be used with atropine sulfate,
                                    narcotic analgesics, other parenterally used analgesics,
                                    commonly used anesthetics, and muscle relaxants.</p>
<p>Immediately prior to intravenous use, Lorazepam Injection
                                    must be diluted with an equal volume of compatible solution.
                                    Contents should be mixed thoroughly by gently inverting the
                                    container repeatedly until a homogenous solution results. Do not
                                    shake vigorously, as this will result in air entrapment. When
                                    properly diluted, the drug may be injected directly into a vein
                                    or into the tubing of an existing intravenous infusion. The rate
                                    of injection should not exceed 2.0 mg per minute.</p>
<p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for
                                    particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration,
                                    whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if solution
                                    is discolored or contains a precipitate.</p>
<p>Lorazepam Injection is compatible for dilution purposes
                                    with the following solutions: Sterile Water for Injection, USP;
