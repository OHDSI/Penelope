<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY     </h1>
<p class="First">Monoamine oxidase is a complex enzyme system, widely distributed throughout the body. Drugs that inhibit monoamine oxidase in the laboratory are associated with a number of clinical effects.</p>
<p>Thus, it is unknown whether MAO inhibition per se, other pharmacologic actions, or an interaction of both is responsible for the clinical effects observed. Therefore, the physician should become familiar with all the effects produced by drugs of this class.</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE     </h1>
<p class="First">Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets, USP has been found to be effective in depressed patients clinically characterized as â€œatypical,â€? â€œnonendogenous,â€? or â€œneurotic.â€? These patients often have mixed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and phobic or hypochondriacal features. There is less conclusive evidence of its usefulness with severely depressed patients with endogenous features.</p>
<p>Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets should rarely be the first antidepressant drug used. Rather, it is more suitable for use with patients who have failed to respond to the drugs more commonly used for these conditions.</p>

<h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS     </h1>
<p class="First">Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets should not be used in patients who are hypersensitive to the drug or its ingredients, with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118993" conceptname="Pheochromocytoma">pheochromocytoma</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>, severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>, a history of liver disease, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438878" conceptname="Liver function tests abnormal">abnormal liver function tests</span>.</p>
<p>The potentiation of sympathomimetic substances and related compounds by MAO inhibitors may result in hypertensive crises (see <a href="#i4i_warnings_id_36b2e579-d0ce-4c45-9816-59ad89a64d68">WARNINGS</a>). Therefore, patients being treated with Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets should not take sympathomimetic drugs (including amphetamines, cocaine, methylphenidate, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine) or related compounds (including methyldopa, L-dopa, L-tryptophan, L-tyrosine, and phenylalanine). Hypertensive crises during Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets therapy may also be caused by the ingestion of foods with a high concentration of tyramine or dopamine. Therefore, patients being treated with Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets should avoid high protein food that has undergone protein breakdown by aging, fermentation, pickling, smoking, or bacterial contamination. Patients should also avoid cheeses (especially aged varieties), pickled herring, beer, wine, liver, yeast extract (including brewerâ€™s yeast in large quantities), dry sausage (including Genoa salami, hard salami, pepperoni, and Lebanon bologna), pods of broad beans (fava beans), and yogurt. Excessive amounts of caffeine and chocolate may also cause hypertensive reactions.</p>
<p>Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets should not be used in combination with dextromethorphan or with CNS depressants such as alcohol and certain narcotics.

<p>Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets should also not be used in combination with buspirone HCl, since several cases of elevated blood pressure have been reported in patients taking MAO inhibitors who were then given buspirone HCl. At least 14 days should elapse between the discontinuation of Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets and the institution of another antidepressant or buspirone HCl, or the discontinuation of another MAO inhibitor and the institution of Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets.</p>
<p>There have been reports of serious reactions (including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4178904" conceptname="Body temperature above reference range">hyperthermia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4050941" conceptname="Muscle rigidity">rigidity</span>, myoclonic movements and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>) when serotoninergic drugs (e.g., dexfenfluramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, venlafaxine) have been combined with an MAO inhibitor. Therefore, the concomitant use of Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets with serotoninergic agents is contraindicated (see <a href="#i4i_interactions_id_1971faaf-7700-4a6b-8b1c-8847292333e3">PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions</a>). At least 14 days should elapse between the discontinuation of an MAO inhibitor and the start of a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor or vice-versa, with the exception of fluoxetine. Allow at least five weeks between discontinuation of fluoxetine and initiation of Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets and at least 14 days between discontinuation of Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets and initiation of fluoxetine, or other serotoninergic agents. Before initiating Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets after using other serotoninergic agents, a sufficient amount of time must be allowed for clearance of the serotoninergic agent and its active metabolites.</p>

There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18â€“24) with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.</p>
<p>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440374" conceptname="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">obsessive compulsive disorder</span> (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.</p>

<h2>Use in Pregnancy    </h2>
<p class="First">The safe use of Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets during pregnancy or lactation has not been established. The potential benefit of this drug, if used during pregnancy, lactation, or in women of childbearing age, should be weighed against the possible hazard to the mother or fetus.</p>
<p>Doses of Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets in pregnant mice well exceeding the maximum recommended human dose have caused a significant decrease in the number of viable offspring per mouse. In addition, the growth of young dogs and rats has been retarded by doses exceeding the maximum human dose.</p>

<h2>Information for Patients      </h2>
<p class="First">Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about â€œAntidepressant Medicines, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> and other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actionsâ€? is available for Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Clinical Worsening and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> Risk</span></p>

Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt.</p>
<p>Such symptoms should be reported to the patientâ€™s prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patientâ€™s presenting symptoms.</p>
<p>Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication.</p>

<h2>Pediatric Use      </h2>
<p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established (see <a href="#id_2de267c0-c5c1-4472-b3ca-c7805ff46350">BOX WARNING</a> and <a href="#i4i_warnings_id_36b2e579-d0ce-4c45-9816-59ad89a64d68">WARNINGS - Clinical Worsening and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> Risk</a>).</p>
<p>Anyone considering the use of Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need.</p>
<p>Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets, as with other hydrazine derivatives, has been reported to induce pulmonary and vascular tumors in an uncontrolled lifetime study in mice.</p>
<p>In depressed patients, the possibility of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span> should always be considered and adequate precautions taken. It is recommended that careful observations of patients undergoing Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets treatment be maintained until control of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> is achieved. If necessary, additional measures (ECT, hospitalization, etc) should be instituted.</p>
<p>All patients undergoing treatment with Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets should be closely followed for symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span>. Hypotensive side effects have occurred in hypertensive asÂ Â  well as normotensive and hypotensive patients. Blood pressure usually returns to pretreatment levels rapidly when the drug is discontinued or the dosage is reduced.</p>
<p>Because the effect of Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets on the convulsive threshold may be variable, adequate precautions should be taken when treating epileptic patients.</p>
<p>Of the more severe side effects that have been reported with any consistency, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333678" conceptname="Hypomania">hypomania</span> has been the most common. This reaction has been largely limited to patients in whom disorders characterized by hyperkinetic symptoms coexist with, but are obscured by, depressive affect; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333678" conceptname="Hypomania">hypomania</span> usually appeared as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> improved. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span> is present, it may be increased with Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333678" conceptname="Hypomania">Hypomania</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span> have also been reported at higher than recommended doses or following long-term therapy.</p>
<p>Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets may cause excessive stimulation in schizophrenic patients; in manicdepressive states it may result in a swing from a depressive to a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span> phase.</p>
<p>Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets should be used with caution in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus; increased insulin sensitivity may occur. Requirements for insulin or oral hypoglycemics may be decreased.</p>
<p>MAO inhibitors, including Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets, potentiate hexobarbital hypnosis in animals. Therefore, barbiturates should be given at a reduced dose with Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets.</p>
<p>MAO inhibitors inhibit the destruction of serotonin and norepinephrine, which are believed to be released from tissue stores by rauwolfia alkaloids. Accordingly, caution should be exercised when rauwolfia is used concomitantly with an MAO inhibitor, including Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets.</p>
<p>There is conflicting evidence as to whether or not MAO inhibitors affect glucose metabolism or potentiate hypoglycemic agents. This should be kept in mind if Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets is administered to diabetics.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions      </h2>
<p class="First">In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., dexfenfluramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, venlafaxine) there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions. Because Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets is a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets should not be used concomitantly with a serotoninergic agent (See <a href="#i4i_contraindications_id_cdf3051b-d9a0-41f1-b6cc-e70917ce5145">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>).</p>
<p>Administration of guanethidine to patients receiving an MAO inhibitor can produce moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> due to release of catecholamines. At least two weeks should elapse between withdrawal of the MAO inhibitor and the initiation of guanethidine. (see<a href="#i4i_contraindications_id_cdf3051b-d9a0-41f1-b6cc-e70917ce5145">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>)</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use      </h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS     </h1>
<p class="First">Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets is a potent inhibitor of monoamine oxidase. Because this enzyme is widely distributed throughout the body, diverse pharmacologic effects can be expected to occur.</p>
<p>When they occur, such effects tend to be mild or moderate in severity (see below), often subside as treatment continues, and can be minimized by adjusting dosage; rarely is it necessary to institute counteracting measures or to discontinue Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION     </h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Initial dose</span></p>
<p>The usual starting dose of Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets is one tablet (15 mg) three times a day.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Early phase treatment</span></p>
<p>Dosage should be increased to at least 60 mg per day at a fairly rapid pace consistent with patient tolerance. It may be necessary to increase dosage up to 90 mg per day to obtain sufficient MAO inhibition. Many patients do not show a clinical response until treatment at 60 mg has been continued for at least 4 weeks.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Maintenance dose</span></p>
<p>After maximum benefit from Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets is achieved, dosage should be reduced slowly over several weeks. Maintenance dose may be as low as one tablet, 15 mg, a day or every other day, and should be continued for as long as is required.</p>

<p>Accidental or intentional overdosage may be more common in patients who are depressed. It should be remembered that multiple drugs and/or alcohol may have been ingested.</p>
<p>Depending on the amount of overdosage with Phenelzine Sulfate Tablets, a varying and mixed clinical picture may develop, including signs and symptoms of central nervous system and cardiovascular stimulation and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>. Signs and symptoms may be absent or minimal during the initial 12-hour period following ingestion and may develop slowly thereafter, reaching a maximum in 24â€“48 hours. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Death</span> has been reported following overdosage. Therefore, immediate hospitalization, with continuous patient observation and monitoring throughout this period, is essential.</p>

<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Treatment</span></span></p>
<p>Respiration should be supported by appropriate measures, including management of the airway, use of supplemental oxygen, and mechanical ventilatory assistance, as required.</p>
<p>Body temperature should be monitored closely. Intensive management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260205" conceptname="Hyperpyrexia">hyperpyrexia</span> may be required. Maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance is essential.</p>
<p>There are no data on the lethal dose in man. The pathophysiologic effects of massive overdosage may persist for several days, since the drug acts by inhibiting physiologic enzyme systems. With symptomatic and supportive measures, recovery from <span class="Italics">mild </span>overdosage may be expected within 3 to 4 days.</p>
<p>Hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and charcoal hemoperfusion may be of value in massive overdosage, but sufficient data are not available to recommend their routine use in these cases.</p>
<p>Toxic blood levels of phenelzine have not been established, and assay methods are not practical for clinical or toxicological use.</p>
