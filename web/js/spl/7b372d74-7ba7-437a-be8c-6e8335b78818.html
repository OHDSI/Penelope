<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Methylphenidate is a racemic mixture comprised of the <span class="Italics">d-</span> and <span class="Italics">l-threo</span> enantiomers. The <span class="Italics">d-threo</span> enantiomer is more pharmacologically active than the <span class="Italics">l-threo</span> enantiomer.</p>
<p>Methylphenidate HCl is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant.</p>
<p>The mode of therapeutic action in humans is not completely understood, but methylphenidate presumably activates the brain stem arousal system and cortex to produce its stimulant effect. Methylphenidate is thought to block the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space.</p>
<p>There is neither specific evidence which clearly establishes the mechanism whereby Methylphenidate HCl Oral Solution produces its mental and behavioral effects in children, nor conclusive evidence regarding how these effects relate to the condition of the central nervous system.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p>
<p>Methylphenidate HCl Oral Solution is readily absorbed. Following oral administration of Methylphenidate HCl Oral Solution, peak plasma methylphenidate concentrations are achieved at 1 to 2 hours. Methylphenidate HCl Oral Solution has been shown to be bioequivalent to Ritalin<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">Â®</span></span> tablet. The mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> following a 20 mg dose is approximately 9 ng/mL.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Food Effect</span></p>
<p>In a study in adult volunteers to investigate the effects of a high-fat meal on the bioavailability of Methylphenidate HCl Oral Solution at a dose of 20 mg, the presence of food delayed the peak by approximately 1 hour (1.7 hours, fasted and 2.7 hours, fed). Overall, a high-fat meal increased the C<span class="Sub">max</span> of Methylphenidate HCl Oral Solution by about 13% and the AUC by about 25%, on average. Through a cross-study comparison, the magnitude of increase in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC is found to be comparable between the Methylphenidate HCl Oral Solution and Ritalin, the immediate release tablet.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Metabolism and Excretion</span></p>
<p>In humans, methylphenidate is metabolized primarily via deesterification to alpha-phenylpiperidine acetic acid (PPA, ritalinic acid). The metabolite has little or no pharmacologic activity.</p>
<p>After oral dosing of radiolabeled methylphenidate in humans, about 90% of the radioactivity was recovered in urine. The main urinary metabolite was PPA, accounting for approximately 80% of the dose.</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of the Methylphenidate HCl Oral Solution have been studied in healthy adult volunteers. The mean terminal half-life (t<span class="Sub">Â½</span>) of methylphenidate following administration of 20 mg Methylphenidate HCl Oral Solution (t<span class="Sub">Â½</span> = 2.7 hours) is comparable to the mean terminal t<span class="Sub">Â½</span> following administration of Ritalin (methylphenidate hydrochloride immediate-release tablets) (t<span class="Sub">Â½</span> = 2.8h) in healthy adult volunteers.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Special Populations</span></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Gender</span> â€“ The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate after Methylphenidate HCl Oral Solution administration has not been studied.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Race</span> â€“ The influence of race on the pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate after Methylphenidate HCl Oral Solution administration has not been studied.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Age</span> â€“ The pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate after Methylphenidate HCl Oral Solution administration have not been studied in pediatrics.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span></span></p>
<p>There is no experience with the use of Methylphenidate HCl Oral Solution in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>. After oral administration of radiolabeled methylphenidate in humans, methylphenidate was extensively metabolized and approximately 80% of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine in the form of ritalinic acid. Since renal clearance is not an important route of methylphenidate clearance, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> is expected to have little effect on the pharmacokinetics of Methylphenidate HCl Oral Solution.</p>

<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4149353" conceptname="Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, predominantly inattentive type">Attention Deficit Disorders</span> </span>(previously known as Minimal Brain Dysfunction in Children). Other terms being used to describe the behavioral syndrome below include: Hyperkinetic Child Syndrome, Minimal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4080670" conceptname="Brain damage">Brain Damage</span>, Minimal Cerebral Dysfunction, Minor Cerebral Dysfunction.</p>
<p>Methylphenidate HCl Oral Solution is indicated as an integral part of a total treatment program which typically includes other remedial measures (psychological, educational, social) for a stabilizing effect in children with a behavioral syndrome characterized by the following group of developmentally inappropriate symptoms: moderate-to-severe distractibility, short attention span, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">hyperactivity</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4078201" conceptname="Mood swings">emotional lability</span>, and impulsivity. The diagnosis of this syndrome should not be made with finality when these symptoms are only of comparatively recent origin. Nonlocalizing (soft) neurological signs, learning <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052648" conceptname="Disability">disability</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168553" conceptname="Electroencephalogram abnormal">abnormal EEG</span> may or may not be present, and a diagnosis of central nervous system dysfunction may or may not be warranted.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Special Diagnostic Considerations</span></p>
<p>Specific etiology of this syndrome is unknown, and there is no single diagnostic test. Adequate diagnosis requires the use not only of medical but of special psychological, educational, and social resources.</p>
<p>Characteristics commonly reported include: chronic history of short attention span, distractibility, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4078201" conceptname="Mood swings">emotional lability</span>, impulsivity, and moderate-to-severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">hyperactivity</span>; minor neurological signs and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168553" conceptname="Electroencephalogram abnormal">abnormal EEG</span>. Learning may or may not be impaired. The diagnosis must be based upon a complete history and evaluation of the child and not solely on the presence of one or more of these characteristics.</p>
<p>Drug treatment is not indicated for all children with this syndrome. Stimulants are not intended for use in the child who exhibits symptoms secondary to environmental factors and/or primary psychiatric disorders, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychosis</span>. Appropriate educational placement is essential and psychosocial intervention is generally necessary. When remedial measures alone are insufficient, the decision to prescribe stimulant medication will depend upon the physicianâ€™s assessment of the chronicity and severity of the childâ€™s symptoms.</p>

Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild; however, very rare sequelae include digital ulceration and/or soft tissue breakdown. Effects of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaudâ€™s phenomenon, were observed in post-marketing reports at different times and at therapeutic doses in all age groups throughout the course of treatment. Signs and symptoms generally improve after reduction in dose or discontinuation of drug. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228617" conceptname="Add">ADHD</span> stimulants. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for certain patients. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Long-Term Suppression of Growth</span></p>
<p>Careful follow-up of weight and height in children ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or non-medication treatment groups over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate-treated and non-medication treated children over 36 months (to the ages of 10 to 13 years), suggests that consistently medicated children (i.e., treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have a temporary slowing in growth rate (on average, a total of about 2 cm less growth in height and 2.7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years), without evidence of growth rebound during this period of development.</p>
<p>Published data are inadequate to determine whether chronic use of amphetamines may cause a similar suppression of growth, however, it is anticipated that they likely have this effect as well. Therefore, growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants, and patients who are not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted.</p>

<p class="First">Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with methylphenidate and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide is available for Methylphenidate HCl Oral Solution. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Methylphenidate HCl Oral Solution may decrease the hypotensive effect of guanethidine. Use cautiously with pressor agents.</p>
<p>Human pharmacologic studies have shown that Methylphenidate HCl Oral Solution may inhibit the metabolism of coumarin anticoagulants, anticonvulsants (phenobarbital, diphenylhydantoin, primidone), phenylbutazone, and tricyclic drugs (imipramine, clomipramine, desipramine). Downward dosage adjustments of these drugs may be required when given concomitantly with Methylphenidate HCl Oral Solution.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">In a lifetime carcinogenicity study carried out in B6C3F1 mice, methylphenidate caused an increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4301500" conceptname="Liver cell adenoma">hepatocellular adenomas</span> and, in males only, an increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4001172" conceptname="Hepatoblastoma">hepatoblastomas</span>, at a daily dose of approximately 60 mg/kg/day. This dose is approximately 30 times and 2.5 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/kg and mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, respectively. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4001172" conceptname="Hepatoblastoma">Hepatoblastoma</span> is a relatively rare rodent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197506" conceptname="Malignant neoplasm of abdomen">malignant tumor</span> type. There was no increase in total malignant hepatic tumors. The mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span> used is sensitive to the development of hepatic tumors, and the significance of these results to humans is unknown.</p>
<p>Methylphenidate did not cause any increase in tumors in a lifetime carcinogenicity study carried out in F344 rats; the highest dose used was approximately 45 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 22 times and 4 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/kg and mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, respectively.</p>
<p>Methylphenidate was not mutagenic in the <span class="Italics">in </span><span class="Italics">vitro</span> Ames reverse mutation assay or in the <span class="Italics">in </span><span class="Italics">vitro</span> mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> cell forward mutation assay.

<h2><span class="Bold">Usage in Pregnancy</span></h2>
<p class="First">Adequate animal reproduction studies to establish safe use of Methylphenidate HCl Oral Solution during pregnancy have not been conducted. However, in a recently conducted study, methylphenidate has been shown to have teratogenic effects in rabbits when given in doses of 200 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 167 times and 78 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/kg and a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, respectively. In rats, teratogenic effects were not seen when the drug was given in doses of 75 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 62.5 and 13.5 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/kg and a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, respectively. Therefore, until more information is available, methylphenidate should not be prescribed for women of childbearing age unless, in the opinion of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible risks.</p>
