<p>Glycopyrrolate occurs as a white, odorless crystalline powder. It is soluble in water and alcohol, and practically insoluble in chloroform and ether.<br>Unlike atropine, glycopyrrolate is completely ionized at physiological pH values. ROBINUL (glycopyrrolate) Injection is a clear, colorless, sterile liquid; pH 2.0â€“ 3.0. The partition coefficient of glycopyrrolate in a n-octanol/water system is 0.304 (log10 P= -1.52) at ambient room temperature (24Â°C).<br></p>

<h1>Clinical Pharmacology</h1>
<p class="First">Glycopyrrolate, like other anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents, inhibits the action of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves and on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These peripheral cholinergic receptors are present in the autonomic effector cells of smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, the sinoatrial node,<br>the atrioventricular node, exocrine glands and, to a limited degree, in the autonomic ganglia. Thus, it diminishes the volume and free acidity of gastric secretions and controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal, and bronchial secretions. Glycopyrrolate antagonizes muscarinic symptoms (e.g., bronchorrhea, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256717" conceptname="Bronchospasm">bronchospasm</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010029" conceptname="Increased intestinal motility">intestinal hypermotility</span>) induced by cholinergic drugs such as the anticholinesterases. The highly polar quaternary ammonium group of glycopyrrolate limits its passage across lipid membranes, such as the blood-brain barrier, in contrast to atropine sulfate and scopolamine hydrobromide, which are highly non-polar tertiary amines which penetrate lipid barriers easily. With intravenous injection, the onset of action is generally evident within one minute. Following intramuscular administration, the onset of action is noted in 15 to 30 minutes, with peak effects occurring within approximately 30 to 45 minutes. The vagal blocking effects persist for 2 to 3 hours and the antisialagogue effects persist up to 7 hours, periods longer than for atropine.<br><span class="Bold"></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span><br>The following pharmacokinetic information and conclusions were obtained from published studies that used nonspecific assay methods.<br></p>
<p>Distribution<br>The mean volume of distribution of glycopyrrolate was estimated to be 0.42Â±0.22L/kg.<br></p>
<p>Metabolism<br>Thein vivometabolism of glycopyrrolate in humans has not been studied.<br><br>Excretion<br>The mean clearance and mean T1/2 values were reported to be 0.54Â±0.14 L/kg/hr and 0.83Â±0.13 hr, respectively post IV administration. After IV administration of a 0.2 mg radiolabeled glycopyrrolate, 85% of dose recovered was recovered in urine 48 hours postdose and some of the radioactivity was also recovered in bile. After IM administration of glycopyrrolate to adults, the<br>mean T1/2 value is reported to be between 0.55 to 1.25 hrs. Over 80% of IM dose administered was recovered in urine and the bile as unchanged drug and half the IM dose is excreted within 3 hrs.

There have been rare reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span>, primarily in preterm infants, associated with exposure to excessive amounts of benzyl alcohol. The amount of benzyl alcohol from medications is usually considered negligible compared to that received in flush solutions containing benzyl alcohol. Administration of high dosages of medications containing this preservative must take into account the total amount of benzyl alcohol administered. The amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. If the patient requires more than the recommended dosages or other medications containing this preservative, the practitioner must consider the daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from these combined sources. (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use).

Dosage adjustments may be necessary (seePharmacokineticsâ€“<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal Impairment</span>). Use ROBINUL with caution in the elderly and in all patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4080146" conceptname="Autonomic neuropathy">autonomic neuropathy</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="81893" conceptname="Ulcerative colitis">ulcerative colitis</span>, prostic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4210465" conceptname="Hypertrophy">hypertrophy</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224004" conceptname="Hiatal hernia">hiatal hernia</span>, since anticholinergic drugs may aggravate these conditions. The use of anticholinergetic drugs in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4265600" conceptname="Gastric ulcer">gastric ulcer</span> may produce a delay in gastric emptying due to antral statis.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Information for the Patient</span><br>Because ROBINUL Injection may produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079185" conceptname="Hazy vision">blurred vision</span>, the patient should be cautioned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness and/or visual acuity such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery, or performing hazardous work while taking this drug (seeWARNINGS). The patient also should be cautioned about the use of this drug during exercise or hot weather since overheating may result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4181404" conceptname="Heat stroke">heat stroke</span>. The patient may experience a possible sensitivity of the eyes to light.<br><span class="Bold"></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span><br>The concurrent use of ROBINUL Injection with other anticholinergics or medications with anticholinergic activity, such as phenothiazines, antiparkinson drugs, or tricyclic antidepressants, may intensify the antimuscarinic effects and may result in an increase in anticholinergic side effects. Concomitant administration of ROBINUL Injection and potassium chloride in a wax matrix may increase the severity of potassium chloride-induced gastrointestinal lesions as a result of a slower gastrointestinal transit time.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility</span><br>Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Studies to evaluate the mutagenic potential of glycopyrrolate have not been conducted. In reproduction studies in rats, dietary administration of glycopyrrolate resulted in diminished rates of conception in a dose-related manner. Other studies in dogs suggest that this may be due to diminished seminal secretion which is evident at high doses of glycopyrrolate.<br><span class="Bold"></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy</span><br>Teratogenic Effectsâ€“ Pregnancy Category B.<br>Reproduction studies with glycopyrrolate were performed in rats at a dietary dose of approximately 65 mg/kg/day (exposure was approximately 320 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of 2 mg on a mg/m2 basis) and rabbits at intramuscular doses of up to 0.5 mg/kg/day (exposure was approximately 5 times the maximum recommended daily human dose on a mg/m2 basis). These studies produced no teratogenic effects to the fetus.Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.Â  <br></p>
<p>Single-dose studies in humans found that very small amounts of glycopyrrolate passed the placental barrier.<br></p>
<p>Nonteratogenic Effects<br>Published literature suggest the following regarding the use of glycopyrrolate during pregnancy. Unlike atropine, glycopyrrolate in normal doses (0.004 mg/kg) does not appear to affect fetal heart rate or fetal heart rate variability to a significant degree. Concentrations of glycopyrrolate in umbilical venous and aterial blood and in the amniotic fluid are low after intramuscular<br>administration to parturients. Therefore, glycopyrrolate does not appear to penetrate through the placental barrier in significant amounts. In reproduction studies in rats, dietary administration of glycopyrrolate resulted in diminished rats of pup survival in a doserelated manner.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers</span><br>It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when ROBINUL Injection is administered to a nursing woman. As with other anticholinergics, glycopyrrolate may cause suppression of lactation (seeADVERSE REACTIONS).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use</span><br>Due to its benzyl alcohol content, ROBINUL Injection should not be used in neonates, i.e., patients less than 1 month of age. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 16 years have not been established. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established for the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4027663" conceptname="Peptic ulcer">peptic ulcer</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">Dysrhythmias</span> associated with the use of glycopyrrolate intravenously as a premedicant or during anesthesia have been observed in pediatric patients. Infants, patients with Downâ€™s syndrome, and pediatric patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4300746" conceptname="Spastic paralysis">spastic paralysis</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4080670" conceptname="Brain damage">brain damage</span> may experience an increased response to anticholinergics, thus increasing the potential for side effects. A paradoxical reaction characterized by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">hyperexcitability</span> may occur in pediatric patients taking large doses of anticholinergics including ROBINUL Injection. Infants and young children are especially susceptible to the toxic effects of anticholinergics.<br>Benzyl alcohol, a component of this drug product, has been associated with serious adverse events and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>, particularly in pediatric patients. Theâ€œgasping syndrome,â€? (characterized by central nervous system <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">gasping</span> respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites found in the blood and urine) has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages greater than 99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low-birth-weight neonates. Additional symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439847" conceptname="Intracranial hemorrhage">intracranial hemorrhage</span>, hemotologic abnormalities, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140842" conceptname="Changes in skin texture">skin breakdown</span>, hepatic and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443240" conceptname="Collapse">cardiovascular collapse</span>. Although normal therapeutic doses of this product deliver amounts of benzyl alcohol that are substantially lower than those reported in association with theâ€œgasping syndrome,â€? the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Premature and low-birthweight infants, as well as patients receiving high dosages, may be more likely to develop toxicity. Practitioners administering this and other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Geriatric Use</span><br>Clinical Studies of ROBINUL Injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other therapy.</p>

For this reason the occurrence of CNS-related side effects is lower, in comparison to their incidence following administration of anticholinergics which are chemically tertiary amines that can cross this barrier readily.</p>

<h1>Overdosage</h1>
<p class="First">To combat peripheral anticholinergic effects, a quaternary ammonium anticholinesterase such as neostigmine methylsulfate (which does not cross the blood-brain barrier) may be given intravenously in increments of 0.25 mg in adults. This dosage may be repeated every five to ten minutes until anticholinergic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">overactivity</span> is reversed or up to a maximum of 2.5 mg. Proportionately smaller doses should be used in pediatric patients. Indication for repetitive doses of neostigmine should be based on close monitoring of the decrease in heart rate and the return of bowel sounds. If CNS symptoms (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">excitement</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">restlessness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychotic</span> behavior) occur, physostigmine (which does cross the bloodâ€“brain barrier) may be used. Physostigmine 0.5 to 2 mg should be slowly administered intravenously and repeated as necessary up to a total of 5 mg in adults. Proportionately smaller doses should be used in pediatric patients. To combat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, administer IV fluids and/or pressor agents along with supportive care. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">Fever</span> should be treated symptomatically. Following overdosage, a curare-like action may occur, i.e., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">neuromuscular blockade</span> leading to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79908" conceptname="Muscle weakness">muscular weakness</span> and possible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440377" conceptname="Paralysis">paralysis</span>. In the event of a curare-like effect on respiratory muscles, artificial respiration should be instituted and maintained until effective respiratory action returns.</p>

<h1>Dosage and Administration</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">NOTE: CONTAINS BENZYL ALCOHOL (see PRECAUTIONS)</span><br>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.<br>ROBINUL Injection may be administered intramuscularly, or intravenously, without dilution, in the following indications.<br></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Adults</span><br></p>
<p>Preanesthetic Medication<br>The recommended dose of ROBINUL Injection is 0.004 mg/kg by intramuscular injection, given 30 to 60 minutes prior to the anticipated time of induction of anesthesia or at the time the preanesthetic narcotic and/or sedative are administered.<br></p>
<p>Intraoperative Medication<br>ROBINUL Injection may be used during surgery to counteract drug-induced or vagal reflexes and their associated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span> (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>). It should be administered intravenously as single doses of 0.1 mg and repeated, as needed, at intervals of 2 to 3 minutes. The usual attempts should be made to determine the etiology of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span>, and the surgical or anesthetic manipulations necessary to correct parasympathetic imbalance should be performed.<br></p>
<p>Reversal of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">Neuromuscular Blockade</span><br>The recommended dose of ROBINUL Injection is 0.2 mg for each 1.0 mg of neostigmine or 5.0 mg of pyridostigmine. In order to minimize the appearance of cardiac side effects, the drugs may be administered simultaneously by intravenous injection and may be mixed in the same syringe.<br></p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4027663" conceptname="Peptic ulcer">Peptic Ulcer</span><br>The usual recommended dose of ROBINUL Injection is 0.1 mg administered at 4-hour intervals, 3 or 4 times daily intravenously or intramuscularly. Where more profound effect is required, 0.2 mg may be given. Some patients may need only a single dose, and frequency of administration should be dictated by patient response up to a maximum of four times daily. <br></p>
<p>ROBINUL Injection is not recommended for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4027663" conceptname="Peptic ulcer">peptic ulcer</span> in pediatric patients (seePRECAUTIONSâ€“ Pediatric Use).<br></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients</span><br>(seePRECAUTIONSâ€“ Pediatric Use)<br></p>

<p>Infants<br>(1 month to 2 years of age) may require up to 0.009 mg/kg.<br></p>
<p>Intraoperative Medication<br>Because of the long duration of action of ROBINUL Injection if used as preanesthetic medication, additional ROBINUL Injection for anticholinergic effect intraoperatively is rarely needed; in the event it is required the recommended pediatric dose is 0.004 mg/ kg intravenously, not to exceed 0.1 mg in a single dose which may be repeated, as needed, at intervals of 2 to 3 minutes.
