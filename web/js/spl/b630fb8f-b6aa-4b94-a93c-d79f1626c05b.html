<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:
</h1>
<p class="First">NuLYTELY induces a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span> which rapidly cleanses the bowel, usually within four hours. The osmotic activity of polyethylene glycol 3350 and the electrolyte concentration result in virtually no net absorption or excretion of ions or water. Accordingly, large volumes may be administered without significant changes in fluid or electrolyte balance.

If a patient experiences severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442597" conceptname="Swollen abdomen">bloating</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218984" conceptname="Abdominal distension">distention</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal pain</span>, administration should be slowed or temporarily discontinued until the symptoms abate.

<a name="s9"></a><a name="section-7.2"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Information for patients:</span> NuLYTELY produces a watery stool which cleanses the bowel before examination. Prepare the solution according to the instructions on the bottle. It is more palatable if chilled. For best results, no solid food should be consumed during the 3 to 4 hour period before drinking the solution, but in no case should solid foods be eaten within 2 hours of taking NuLYTELY.
</p>
<p>Adults drink 240 mL (8 oz.) every 10 minutes. Continue drinking until the watery stool is clear and free of solid matter. This usually requires at least 3 liters. Any unused portion should be discarded. Pediatric patients (aged 6 months or greater) drink 25 mL/kg/hour. Continue drinking until the watery stool is clear and free of solid matter. Any unused portion should be discarded. Rapid drinking of each portion is better than drinking small amounts continuously. The first bowel movement should occur approximately one hour after the start of NuLYTELY administration. You may experience some <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4023572" conceptname="Abdominal bloating">abdominal bloating</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218984" conceptname="Abdominal distension">distention</span> before the bowels start to move.

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:
</h1>
<p class="First">NuLYTELY is usually administered orally, but may be given via nasogastric tube to patients who are unwilling or unable to drink the solution. Ideally, the patient should fast for approximately three or four hours prior to NuLYTELY administration, but in no case should solid food be given for at least two hours before the solution is given.
</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s16"></a><a name="section-9.1"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Oral administration: Adults:</span> At a rate of 240 mL(8 oz.) every 10 minutes, until the rectal effluent is clear or 4 liters are consumed. <span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients (aged 6 months or greater):</span> At a rate of 25 mL/kg/hour, until the rectal effluent is clear. Rapid drinking of each portion is preferred to drinking small amounts continuously. <span class="Bold">Nasogastric tube administration: Adults:</span> At a rate of 20-30 mL per minute (1.2-1.8 liters per hour). <span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients (aged 6 months or greater):</span> At a rate of 25 mL/kg/hour, until the rectal effluent is clear.
</p>
<p>The first bowel movement should occur approximately one hour after the start of NuLYTELY administration. Ingestion of 4 liters of NuLYTELY solution prior to gastrointestinal examination produces satisfactory preparation in over 95% of patients.
</p>
<p>Various regimens have been used. One method is to schedule patients for examination in midmorning or later, allowing the patients three hours for drinking and an additional one hour period for complete bowel evacuation. Another method is to administer NuLYTELY on the evening before the examination.
