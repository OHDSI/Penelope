<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">FOSAMAX<a href="#footnote-1">1</a> (alendronate sodium) is a bisphosphonate that 
acts as a specific inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. 
Bisphosphonates are synthetic analogs of pyrophosphate that bind to the 
hydroxyapatite found in bone.</p>
<p>Alendronate sodium is chemically described as (4-amino-1-hydroxybutylidene) 
bisphosphonic acid monosodium salt trihydrate.</p>The empirical formula of alendronate sodium is C<span class="Sub">4</span>H<span class="Sub">12</span>NNaO<span class="Sub">7</span>P<span class="Sub">2</span>•3H<span class="Sub">2</span>O and its formula weight is 325.12. 
The structural formula is:<div class="Figure"><img alt="image of chemical structure" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=e6ffadda-2ace-4e99-8bb4-75631c54f39b&amp;name=chemical%20structure.jpg"></div>
<p>Alendronate sodium is a white, crystalline, nonhygroscopic powder. It is 
soluble in water, very slightly soluble in alcohol, and practically insoluble in 
chloroform.</p>
<p>Tablets FOSAMAX for oral administration contain 6.53, 13.05, 45.68, 52.21 or 
91.37 mg of alendronate monosodium salt trihydrate, which is the molar 
equivalent of 5, 10, 35, 40 and 70 mg, respectively, of free acid, and the 
following inactive ingredients: microcrystalline cellulose, anhydrous lactose, 
croscarmellose sodium, and magnesium stearate. Tablets FOSAMAX 10 mg also 
contain carnauba wax.</p>
<p>Each bottle of the oral solution contains 91.35 mg of alendronate monosodium 
salt trihydrate, which is the molar equivalent to 70 mg of free acid. Each 
bottle also contains the following inactive ingredients: sodium citrate 
dihydrate and citric acid anhydrous as buffering agents, sodium saccharin, 
artificial raspberry flavor, and purified water. Added as preservatives are 
sodium propylparaben 0.0225% and sodium butylparaben 0.0075%.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<a href="http://"></a>Mechanism of Action<p class="First">Animal studies have indicated the following mode of action. At 
the cellular level, alendronate shows preferential localization to sites of bone 
resorption, specifically under osteoclasts. The osteoclasts adhere normally to 
the bone surface but lack the ruffled border that is indicative of active 
resorption. Alendronate does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment or 
attachment, but it does inhibit osteoclast activity. Studies in mice on the 
localization of radioactive [<span class="Sup">3</span>H]alendronate in bone 
showed about 10-fold higher uptake on osteoclast surfaces than on osteoblast 
surfaces. Bones examined 6 and 49 days after [<span class="Sup">3</span>H]alendronate administration in rats and mice, respectively, 
showed that normal bone was formed on top of the alendronate, which was 
incorporated inside the matrix. While incorporated in bone matrix, alendronate 
is not pharmacologically active. Thus, alendronate must be continuously 
administered to suppress osteoclasts on newly formed resorption surfaces. 
Histomorphometry in baboons and rats showed that alendronate treatment reduces 
bone turnover (i.e., the number of sites at which bone is remodeled). In 
addition, bone formation exceeds bone resorption at these remodeling sites, 
leading to progressive gains in bone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span>.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pharmacokinetics<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Absorption<p>Relative to an intravenous (IV) reference dose, the mean oral 
bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses ranging from 5 to 
70 mg when administered after an overnight fast and two hours before a 
standardized breakfast. Oral bioavailability of the 10 mg tablet in men (0.59%) 
was similar to that in women when administered after an overnight fast and 
2 hours before breakfast.</p>
<p>FOSAMAX 70 mg oral solution and FOSAMAX 70 mg tablet are equally 
bioavailable.</p>
<p>A study examining the effect of timing of a meal on the bioavailability of 
alendronate was performed in 49 postmenopausal women. Bioavailability was 
decreased (by approximately 40%) when 10 mg alendronate was administered either 
0.5 or 1 hour before a standardized breakfast, when compared to dosing 2 hours 
before eating. In studies of treatment and prevention of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span>, 
alendronate was effective when administered at least 30 minutes before 
breakfast.</p>
<p>Bioavailability was negligible whether alendronate was administered with or 
up to two hours after a standardized breakfast. Concomitant administration of 
alendronate with coffee or orange juice reduced bioavailability by approximately 
60%.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Distribution<p>Preclinical studies (in male rats) show that alendronate 
transiently distributes to soft tissues following 1 mg/kg IV administration but 
is then rapidly redistributed to bone or excreted in the urine. The mean 
steady-state volume of distribution, exclusive of bone, is at least 28 L in 
humans. Concentrations of drug in plasma following therapeutic oral doses are 
too low (less than 5 ng/mL) for analytical detection. Protein binding in human 
plasma is approximately 78%.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Metabolism<p>There is no evidence that alendronate is metabolized in animals 
or humans.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Excretion<p>Following a single IV dose of [<span class="Sup">14</span>C]alendronate, approximately 50% of the radioactivity was 
excreted in the urine within 72 hours and little or no radioactivity was 
recovered in the feces. Following a single 10 mg IV dose, the renal clearance of 
alendronate was 71 mL/min (64, 78; 90% confidence interval [CI]), and systemic 
clearance did not exceed 200 mL/min. Plasma concentrations fell by more than 95% 
within 6 hours following IV administration. The terminal half-life in humans is 
estimated to exceed 10 years, probably reflecting release of alendronate from 
the skeleton. Based on the above, it is estimated that after 10 years of oral 
treatment with FOSAMAX (10 mg daily) the amount of alendronate released daily 
from the skeleton is approximately 25% of that absorbed from the 
gastrointestinal tract.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Special Populations<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pediatric:<p>The oral bioavailability in children was similar to that observed 
in adults; however, FOSAMAX is not indicated for use in children (see <a href="#section-8.11">PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use</a>).</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Gender:<p>Bioavailability and the fraction of an IV dose excreted in urine 
were similar in men and women.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Geriatric:<p>Bioavailability and disposition (urinary excretion) were similar 
in elderly and younger patients. No dosage adjustment is necessary (see <a href="#section-11">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Race:<p>Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been 
studied.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span>:<p>Preclinical studies show that, in rats with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">kidney failure</span>, 
increasing amounts of drug are present in plasma, kidney, spleen, and tibia. In 
healthy controls, drug that is not deposited in bone is rapidly excreted in the 
urine. No evidence of saturation of bone uptake was found after 3 weeks dosing 
with cumulative IV doses of 35 mg/kg in young male rats. Although no clinical 
information is available, it is likely that, as in animals, elimination of 
alendronate via the kidney will be reduced in patients with impaired renal 
function. Therefore, somewhat greater accumulation of alendronate in bone might 
be expected in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>.</p>
<p>No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild-to-moderate renal 
insufficiency (creatinine clearance 35 to 60 mL/min). <span class="Bold">FOSAMAX 
is not recommended for patients with more severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> (creatinine 
clearance less than 35 mL/min) due to lack of experience with alendronate in renal

insufficiency. No dosage adjustment is necessary.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Drug Interactions<p>(also see <a href="#section-8.7">PRECAUTIONS, Drug 
Interactions</a>)</p>
<p>Intravenous ranitidine was shown to double the bioavailability of oral 
alendronate. The clinical significance of this increased bioavailability and 
whether similar increases will occur in patients given oral H<span class="Sub">2</span>-antagonists is unknown.</p>
<p>In healthy subjects, oral prednisone (20 mg three times daily for five days) 
did not produce a clinically meaningful change in the oral bioavailability of 
alendronate (a mean increase ranging from 20 to 44%).</p>
<p>Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations are likely to 
interfere with absorption of alendronate.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pharmacodynamics<p>Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that binds to bone hydroxyapatite 
and specifically inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells. 
Alendronate reduces bone resorption with no direct effect on bone formation, 
although the latter process is ultimately reduced because bone resorption and 
formation are coupled during bone turnover.</p>

mortality.</p>
<p>Daily oral doses of alendronate (5, 20, and 40 mg for six weeks) in 
postmenopausal women produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent 
inhibition of bone resorption, including decreases in urinary calcium and 
urinary markers of bone collagen degradation (such as deoxypyridinoline and 
cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen). These biochemical changes 
tended to return toward baseline values as early as 3 weeks following the 
discontinuation of therapy with alendronate and did not differ from placebo 
after 7 months.</p>
<p>Long-term treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> with FOSAMAX 10 mg/day (for up to five 
years) reduced urinary excretion of markers of bone resorption, 
deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type l collagen, by 
approximately 50% and 70%, respectively, to reach levels similar to those seen 
in healthy premenopausal women. Similar decreases were seen in patients in 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> prevention studies who received FOSAMAX 5 mg/day. The decrease in 
the rate of bone resorption indicated by these markers was evident as early as 
one month and at three to six months reached a plateau that was maintained for 
the entire duration of treatment with FOSAMAX. In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> treatment studies 
FOSAMAX 10 mg/day decreased the markers of bone formation, osteocalcin and bone 
specific alkaline phosphatase by approximately 50%, and total serum alkaline 
phosphatase by approximately 25 to 30% to reach a plateau after 6 to 12 months. 
In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> prevention studies FOSAMAX 5 mg/day decreased osteocalcin and 
total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 40% and 15%, respectively. 
Similar reductions in the rate of bone turnover were observed in postmenopausal 
women during one-year studies with once weekly FOSAMAX 70 mg for the treatment 
of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> and once weekly FOSAMAX 35 mg for the prevention of 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span>. These data indicate that the rate of bone turnover reached a new 
steady-state, despite the progressive increase in the total amount of 
alendronate deposited within bone.</p>
<p>As a result of inhibition of bone resorption, asymptomatic reductions in 
serum calcium and phosphate concentrations were also observed following 
treatment with FOSAMAX. In the long-term studies, reductions from baseline in 
serum calcium (approximately 2%) and phosphate (approximately 4 to 6%) were 
evident the first month after the initiation of FOSAMAX 10 mg. No further 
decreases in serum calcium were observed for the five-year duration of 
treatment; however, serum phosphate returned toward prestudy levels during years 
three through five. Similar reductions were observed with FOSAMAX 5 mg/day. In 
one-year studies with once weekly FOSAMAX 35 and 70 mg, similar reductions were 
observed at 6 and 12 months. The reduction in serum phosphate may reflect not 
only the positive bone mineral balance due to FOSAMAX but also a decrease in 
renal phosphate reabsorption.</p>

as a result of inhibited bone formation and increased bone resorption resulting

<p>In clinical studies of up to two years' duration, FOSAMAX 5 and 10 mg/day 
reduced cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (a marker of bone 
resorption) by approximately 60% and reduced bone-specific alkaline phosphatase 
and total serum alkaline phosphatase (markers of bone formation) by 
approximately 15 to 30% and 8 to 18%, respectively. As a result of inhibition of 
bone resorption, FOSAMAX 5 and 10 mg/day induced asymptomatic decreases in serum 
calcium (approximately 1 to 2%) and serum phosphate (approximately 1 
to 8%).</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Paget's disease of bone<p>Paget's disease of bone is a chronic, focal skeletal disorder 
characterized by greatly increased and disorderly bone remodeling. Excessive 
osteoclastic bone resorption is followed by osteoblastic new bone formation, 
leading to the replacement of the normal bone architecture by disorganized, 
enlarged, and weakened bone structure.</p>
<p>Clinical manifestations of Paget's disease range from no symptoms to severe 
morbidity due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129418" conceptname="Bone pain">bone pain</span>, bone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168498" conceptname="Deformity">deformity</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="73571" conceptname="Pathological fracture">pathological fractures</span>, and 
neurological and other complications. Serum alkaline phosphatase, the most 
frequently used biochemical index of disease activity, provides an objective 
measure of disease severity and response to therapy.</p>
<p>FOSAMAX decreases the rate of bone resorption directly, which leads to an 
indirect decrease in bone formation. In clinical trials, FOSAMAX 40 mg once 
daily for six months produced significant decreases in serum alkaline 
phosphatase as well as in urinary markers of bone collagen degradation. As a 
result of the inhibition of bone resorption, FOSAMAX induced generally mild, 
transient, and asymptomatic decreases in serum calcium and phosphate.</p>

<br><p>At three years significant increases in BMD, relative both to baseline and 
placebo, were seen at each measurement site in each study in patients who 
received FOSAMAX 10 mg/day. Total body BMD also increased significantly in each 
study, suggesting that the increases in bone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> of the spine and hip did not 
occur at the expense of other skeletal sites. Increases in BMD were evident as 
early as three months and continued throughout the three years of treatment. 
(See figures below for lumbar spine results.) In the two-year extension of these 
studies, treatment of 147 patients with FOSAMAX 10 mg/day resulted in continued 
increases in BMD at the lumbar spine and trochanter (absolute additional 
increases between years 3 and 5: lumbar spine, 0.94%; trochanter, 0.88%). BMD at 
the femoral neck, forearm and total body were maintained. FOSAMAX was similarly 
effective regardless of age, race, baseline rate of bone turnover, and baseline 
BMD in the range studied (at least 2 standard deviations below the premenopausal 
mean). Thus, overall FOSAMAX reverses the loss of bone mineral density, a

baseline <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4066995" conceptname="Fracture of vertebral column with spinal cord injury">vertebral fracture</span>.</p>
<p>To assess the effects of FOSAMAX on the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4066995" conceptname="Fracture of vertebral column with spinal cord injury">vertebral fractures</span> 
(detected by digitized radiography; approximately one third of these were 
clinically symptomatic), the U.S. and Multinational studies were combined in an 
analysis that compared placebo to the pooled dosage groups of FOSAMAX 
(5 or 10 mg for three years or 20 mg for two years followed by 5 mg for one 
year). There was a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of 
patients treated with FOSAMAX experiencing one or more new <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4066995" conceptname="Fracture of vertebral column with spinal cord injury">vertebral fractures</span> 
relative to those treated with placebo (3.2% vs. 6.2%; a 48% relative risk 
reduction). A reduction in the total number of new <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4066995" conceptname="Fracture of vertebral column with spinal cord injury">vertebral fractures</span> (4.2 vs. 
11.3 per 100 patients) was also observed. In the pooled analysis, patients who 
received FOSAMAX had a loss in stature that was statistically significantly less 
than was observed in those who received placebo (-3.0 mm vs. -4.6 mm).</p>
<p>The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">Fracture</span> Intervention Trial (FIT) consisted of two studies in 
postmenopausal women: the Three-Year Study of patients who had at least one

In both studies of 
FIT, 96% of randomized patients completed the studies (i.e., had a closeout 
visit at the scheduled end of the study); approximately 80% of patients were 
still taking study medication upon completion.</p>

total body, 1.6%. Treatment with FOSAMAX also reduced height loss (FOSAMAX, 
-0.6 mm vs. placebo, -2.4 mm).</p>
<p>A one-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of once

receiving glucocorticoids (at least 7.5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) was 
demonstrated in two, one-year, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
multicenter studies of virtually identical design, one performed in the United 
States and the other in 15 different countries (Multinational [which also 
included FOSAMAX 2.5 mg/day]). These studies enrolled 232 and 328 patients, 
respectively, between the ages of 17 and 83 with a variety of 
glucocorticoid-requiring diseases. Patients received supplemental calcium and 
vitamin D. The following figure shows the mean increases relative to placebo in 
BMD of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and trochanter in patients receiving 
FOSAMAX 5 mg/day for each study.<img alt="image of figure 5 (Studies in Glucocorticoid-Treated Patients)" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=e6ffadda-2ace-4e99-8bb4-75631c54f39b&amp;name=figure%205.jpg"></p>
<p></p>
<p>Studies in Glucocorticoid-Treated Patients: Increase 
in BMD: FOSAMAX 5 mg/day at One Year</p>
<p>After one year, significant increases relative to placebo in BMD were seen in 
the combined studies at each of these sites in patients who received FOSAMAX 
5 mg/day. In the placebo-treated patients, a significant decrease in BMD 
occurred at the femoral neck (-1.2%), and smaller decreases were seen at the 
lumbar spine and trochanter. Total body BMD was maintained with FOSAMAX 
5 mg/day. The increases in BMD with FOSAMAX 10 mg/day were similar to those with 
FOSAMAX 5 mg/day in all patients except for postmenopausal women not receiving 
estrogen therapy. In these women, the increases (relative to placebo) with 
FOSAMAX 10 mg/day were greater than those with FOSAMAX 5 mg/day at the lumbar 
spine (4.1% vs. 1.6%) and trochanter (2.8% vs. 1.7%), but not at other sites. 
FOSAMAX was effective regardless of dose or duration of glucocorticoid use. In 
addition, FOSAMAX was similarly effective regardless of age (less than 65 vs. 
greater than or equal to 65 years), race (Caucasian vs. other races), gender, underlying disease, 
baseline BMD, baseline bone turnover, and use with a variety of common 
medications.</p>
<p>Bone histology was normal in the 49 patients biopsied at the end of one year 
who received FOSAMAX at doses of up to 10 mg/day.</p>
<p>Of the original 560 patients in these studies, 208 patients who remained on 
at least 7.5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent continued into a one-year 
double-blind extension. After two years of treatment, spine BMD increased by 
3.7% and 5.0% relative to placebo with FOSAMAX 5 and 10 mg/day, respectively. 
Significant increases in BMD (relative to placebo) were also observed at the 
femoral neck, trochanter, and total body.</p>
<p>After one year, 2.3% of patients treated with FOSAMAX 5 or 10 mg/day (pooled) 
vs. 3.7% of those treated with placebo experienced a new <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4066995" conceptname="Fracture of vertebral column with spinal cord injury">vertebral fracture</span> (not

FOSAMAX (pooled dosage groups: 5 or 10 mg for two years or 2.5 mg for one year 
followed by 10 mg for one year) significantly reduced the incidence of patients 
with a new <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4066995" conceptname="Fracture of vertebral column with spinal cord injury">vertebral fracture</span> (FOSAMAX 0.7% vs. placebo 6.8%).</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Paget's disease of bone<br><p>The efficacy of FOSAMAX 40 mg once daily for six months was

upper limit of normal): a placebo-controlled, multinational study and a U.S. 
comparative study with etidronate disodium 400 mg/day. The following figure 
shows the mean percent changes from baseline in serum alkaline phosphatase for 
up to six months of randomized treatment.<img alt="image of figure 6 (Studies in Paget's Disease of Bone)" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=e6ffadda-2ace-4e99-8bb4-75631c54f39b&amp;name=figure%206.jpg"></p>

<p>Studies in Paget's Disease of Bone: Effect on Serum 
Alkaline Phosphatase of FOSAMAX 40 mg/day Versus Placebo or Etidronate 400 
mg/day</p>
<p>At six months the suppression in alkaline phosphatase in patients treated 
with FOSAMAX was significantly greater than that achieved with etidronate and 
contrasted with the complete lack of response in placebo-treated patients. 
Response (defined as either normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase or 
decrease from baseline greater than or equal to 60%) occurred in approximately 85% of patients treated 
with FOSAMAX in the combined studies vs. 30% in the etidronate group and 0% in 
the placebo group. FOSAMAX was similarly effective regardless of age, gender, 
race, prior use of other bisphosphonates, or baseline alkaline phosphatase 
within the range studied (at least twice the upper limit of normal).</p>
<p>Bone histology was evaluated in 33 patients with Paget's disease treated with 
FOSAMAX 40 mg/day for 6 months. As in patients treated for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> (see <a href="#section-3.9.1.1.6">Clinical Studies, Treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> in 
postmenopausal women, Bone histology</a>), FOSAMAX did not impair 
mineralization, and the expected decrease in the rate of bone turnover was 
observed. Normal lamellar bone was produced during treatment with FOSAMAX, even 
where preexisting bone was woven and disorganized. Overall, bone histology data 
support the conclusion that bone formed during treatment with FOSAMAX is of 
normal quality.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First">FOSAMAX, like other bisphosphonates, may cause local irritation 
of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa.</p>

<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4268622" conceptname="Stricture of esophagus">esophageal stricture</span> or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving 
treatment with FOSAMAX. In some cases these have been severe and required 
hospitalization. Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms 
signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to 
discontinue FOSAMAX and seek medical attention if they develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31317" conceptname="Dysphagia">dysphagia</span>, 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4147218" conceptname="Swallowing painful">odynophagia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77670" conceptname="Chest pain">retrosternal pain</span> or new or worsening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="23325" conceptname="Heartburn">heartburn</span>.</p>
<p>The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in 
patients who lie down after taking FOSAMAX and/or who fail to swallow it with 
the recommended amount of water, and/or who continue to take FOSAMAX after 
developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very 
important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, 
the patient (see <a href="#section-11">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>). In 
patients who cannot comply with dosing instructions due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4170893" conceptname="Mental handicap">mental disability</span>, 
therapy with FOSAMAX should be used under appropriate supervision.</p>
<p>Because of possible irritant effects of FOSAMAX on the upper gastrointestinal 
mucosa and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should 
be used when FOSAMAX is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal 
problems (such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31317" conceptname="Dysphagia">dysphagia</span>, esophageal diseases, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201340" conceptname="Gastritis">gastritis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433516" conceptname="Duodenitis">duodenitis</span>, or

<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435510" conceptname="Hypocalcemia">Hypocalcemia</span> must be corrected before initiating therapy with FOSAMAX (see <a href="#section-6">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>). Other disorders affecting mineral 
metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency) should also be effectively treated. In 
patients with these conditions, serum calcium and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435510" conceptname="Hypocalcemia">hypocalcemia</span> 
should be monitored during therapy with FOSAMAX.</p>
<p>Presumably due to the effects of FOSAMAX on increasing bone mineral, small, 
asymptomatic decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur, especially in 
patients with Paget's disease, in whom the pretreatment rate of bone turnover 
may be greatly elevated and in patients receiving glucocorticoids, in whom 
calcium absorption may be decreased.</p>
<p>Ensuring adequate calcium and vitamin D intake is especially important in 
patients with Paget's disease of bone and in patients receiving 
glucocorticoids.</p>

reports have been infrequent. This category of drugs includes FOSAMAX 
(alendronate). Most of the patients were postmenopausal women. The time to onset 
of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. 
Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms 
after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the 
same drug or another bisphosphonate.</p>
<p>In placebo-controlled clinical studies of FOSAMAX, the percentages of 
patients with these symptoms were similar in the FOSAMAX and placebo

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Information for Patients<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>General<p>Physicians should instruct their patients to read the patient 
package insert before starting therapy with FOSAMAX and to reread it each time 
the prescription is renewed.</p>
<p>Patients should be instructed to take supplemental calcium and vitamin D, if 
daily dietary intake is inadequate. Weight-bearing exercise should be considered 
along with the modification of certain behavioral factors, such as cigarette 
smoking and/or excessive alcohol consumption, if these factors exist.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Dosing Instructions<p>Patients should be instructed that the expected benefits of 
FOSAMAX may only be obtained when it is taken with plain water the first thing 
upon arising for the day at least 30 minutes before the first food, beverage, or 
medication of the day. Even dosing with orange juice or coffee has been shown to 
markedly reduce the absorption of FOSAMAX (see <a href="#section-3.2.1">CLINICAL 
PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics, Absorption</a>).</p>
<p>To facilitate delivery to the stomach and thus reduce the potential for 
esophageal irritation patients should be instructed to swallow each tablet of 
FOSAMAX with a full glass of water (6-8 oz). To facilitate gastric emptying 
patients should drink at least 2 oz (a quarter of a cup) of water after taking 
FOSAMAX oral solution. Patients should be instructed not to lie down for at 
least 30 minutes <span class="Underline">and</span> until after their first food 
of the day. Patients should not chew or suck on the tablet because of a 
potential for oropharyngeal ulceration. Patients should be specifically 
instructed not to take FOSAMAX at bedtime or before arising for the day. 
Patients should be informed that failure to follow these instructions may 
increase their risk of esophageal problems. Patients should be instructed that 
if they develop symptoms of esophageal disease (such as difficulty or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> upon 
swallowing, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77670" conceptname="Chest pain">retrosternal pain</span> or new or worsening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="23325" conceptname="Heartburn">heartburn</span>) they should stop 
taking FOSAMAX and consult their physician.</p>
<p>Patients should be instructed that if they miss a dose of once weekly 
FOSAMAX, they should take one dose on the morning after they remember. They 
should not take two doses on the same day but should return to taking one dose 
once a week, as originally scheduled on their chosen day.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Drug Interactions <p>(also see <a href="#section-3.3">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, 
Pharmacokinetics, Drug Interactions</a>)</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Estrogen/hormone replacement therapy (HRT)<p>Concomitant use of HRT (estrogen ± progestin) and FOSAMAX was 
assessed in two clinical studies of one or two years' duration in postmenopausal 
osteoporotic women. In these studies, the safety and tolerability profile of the 
combination was consistent with those of the individual treatments; however, the 
degree of suppression of bone turnover (as assessed by mineralizing surface) was 
significantly greater with the combination than with either component alone. The 
long-term effects of combined FOSAMAX and HRT on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">fracture</span> occurrence have not 
been studied (see <a href="#section-3.9.3">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Calcium Supplements/Antacids<p>It is likely that calcium supplements, antacids, and some oral

<p>Bisphosphonates are incorporated into the bone matrix, from which they are 
gradually released over a period of years. The amount of bisphosphonate 
incorporated into adult bone, and hence, the amount available for release back 
into the systemic circulation, is directly related to the dose and duration of 
bisphosphonate use. There are no data on fetal risk in humans. However, there is 
a theoretical risk of fetal harm, predominantly skeletal, if a woman becomes 
pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. The impact of 
variables such as time between cessation of bisphosphonate therapy to 
conception, the particular bisphosphonate used, and the route of administration 
(intravenous versus oral) on the risk has not been studied.</p>
<p>There are no studies in pregnant women. FOSAMAX should be used during 
pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the 
mother and fetus.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Nursing Mothers<p>It is not known whether alendronate is excreted in human milk. 
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when 
FOSAMAX is administered to nursing women.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pediatric Use<p>The efficacy and safety of FOSAMAX were examined in a randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled two-year study of 139 pediatric patients, aged 
4-18 years, with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="78257" conceptname="Osteogenesis imperfecta">osteogenesis imperfecta</span>. One-hundred-and-nine patients 
were randomized to 5 mg FOSAMAX daily (weight less than 40 kg) or 10 mg FOSAMAX daily 
(weight greater than or equal to 40 kg) and 30 patients to placebo. The mean baseline lumbar spine BMD 
Z-score of the patients was -4.5. The mean change in lumbar spine BMD Z-score 
from baseline to Month 24 was 1.3 in the FOSAMAX-treated patients and 0.1 in the 
placebo-treated patients. Treatment with FOSAMAX did not reduce the risk of

at Month 24 compared with 9% of the placebo-treated patients. In FOSAMAX-treated

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">FOSAMAX must be taken <span class="Italics">at least</span> 
one-half hour before the first food, beverage, or medication of the day with 
plain water only (see <a href="#section-8.6">PRECAUTIONS, Information for 
Patients</a>). Other beverages (including mineral water), food, and some 
medications are likely to reduce the absorption of FOSAMAX (see <a href="#section-8.7">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</a>). Waiting less than 30 
minutes, or taking FOSAMAX with food, beverages (other than plain water) or 
other medications will lessen the effect of FOSAMAX by decreasing its absorption 
into the body.</p>
<p>FOSAMAX should only be taken upon arising for the day. To facilitate delivery 
to the stomach and thus reduce the potential for esophageal irritation, a 
FOSAMAX tablet should be swallowed with a full glass of water (6-8 oz). To 
facilitate gastric emptying FOSAMAX oral solution should be followed by at least 
2 oz (a quarter of a cup) of water. Patients should not lie down for at least 30 
minutes <span class="Underline">and </span>until after their first food of the 
day. FOSAMAX should not be taken at bedtime or before arising for the day. 
Failure to follow these instructions may increase the risk of esophageal adverse 
experiences (see <a href="#section-7">WARNINGS</a>, <a href="#section-8.6">PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients</a>).</p>
<p>Patients should receive supplemental calcium and vitamin D, if dietary intake 
is inadequate (see <a href="#section-8.1">PRECAUTIONS, General</a>).</p>
<p>No dosage adjustment is necessary for the elderly or for patients with 
mild-to-moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> (creatinine clearance 35 to 60 mL/min).

(creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min) due to lack of experience.</p>

<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span>?</span><p>Normally your bones are being rebuilt all the time. First, old 
bone is removed (resorbed). Then a similar amount of new bone is formed. This 
balanced process keeps your skeleton healthy and strong.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">Osteoporosis</span> is a thinning and weakening of the bones. It is common in women 
after <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span>, and may also occur in men. In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span>, bone is removed 
faster than it is formed, so overall bone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> is lost and bones become weaker. 
Therefore, keeping bone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> is important to keep your bones healthy. In both 
men and women, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> may also be caused by certain medicines called 
corticosteroids.</p>
<p>At first, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> usually has no symptoms, but it can cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">fractures</span> 
(broken bones). <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">Fractures</span> usually cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">Fractures</span> of the bones of the 
spine may not be painful, but over time they can make you shorter. Eventually, 
your spine can curve and your body can become bent over. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">Fractures</span> may happen 
during normal, everyday activity, such as lifting, or from minor injury that 
would normally not cause bones to break. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">Fractures</span> most often occur at the hip,

<li>
<span class="Bold">Exercise regularly.</span> Like muscles, bones need 
exercise to stay strong and healthy. Exercise must be safe to prevent injuries,

they have the same symptoms you have. It may harm them.</p>
<p>FOSAMAX is not indicated for use in children.</p>
<p>This leaflet is a summary of information about FOSAMAX. If you have any 
questions or concerns about FOSAMAX or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span>, talk to your doctor, 
pharmacist, or other health care provider. You can ask your doctor or pharmacist 
for information about FOSAMAX written for health care providers. For more

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><span class="Bold">What are the ingredients in 
FOSAMAX?</span><p>FOSAMAX contains alendronate sodium as the active ingredient and 
the following inactive ingredients: cellulose, lactose, croscarmellose sodium 
and magnesium stearate. The 10 mg tablet also contains carnauba wax.</p>

<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span>?</span><p>Normally your bones are being rebuilt all the time. First, old 
bone is removed (resorbed). Then a similar amount of new bone is formed. This 
balanced process keeps your skeleton healthy and strong.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">Osteoporosis</span> is a thinning and weakening of the bones. It is common in women 
after <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span>, and may also occur in men. In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span>, bone is removed 
faster than it is formed, so overall bone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> is lost and bones become weaker. 
Therefore, keeping bone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> is important to keep your bones healthy. In both 
men and women, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> may also be caused by certain medicines called 
corticosteroids. </p>
<p>At first, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> usually has no symptoms, but it can cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">fractures</span> 
(broken bones). <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">Fractures</span> usually cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">Fractures</span> of the bones of the 
spine may not be painful, but over time they can make you shorter. Eventually, 
your spine can curve and your body can become bent over. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">Fractures</span> may happen 
during normal, everyday activity, such as lifting, or from minor injury that 
would normally not cause bones to break. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">Fractures</span> most often occur at the hip, 
spine, or wrist. This can lead to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052648" conceptname="Disability">disability</span>, or loss of ability to

treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span>?</span><p>In addition to FOSAMAX, your doctor may suggest one or more of 
the following lifestyle changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="Bold">Stop smoking.</span> Smoking may increase your chance of 
getting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span>. 
</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">Reduce the use of alcohol.</span> Too much alcohol may

</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">Exercise regularly.</span> Like muscles, bones need 
exercise to stay strong and healthy. Exercise must be safe to prevent injuries, 
including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">fractures</span>. Talk with your doctor before you begin any exercise 
program. 
</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">Eat a balanced diet.</span> Having enough calcium in your 
diet is important. Your doctor can advise you whether you need to change your 
diet or take any dietary supplements, such as calcium or vitamin D. </li>
