<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Nulecit<span class="Sup">TM</span> is used to replete the total body content of iron.  Iron is critical for normal hemoglobin synthesis to maintain oxygen transport.  Additionally, iron is necessary for metabolism and various enzymatic processes.</p>
<p>The total body iron content of an adult ranges from 2 to 4 grams.  Approximately 2/3 is in hemoglobin and 1/3 is in reticuloendothelial (RE) storage (bone marrow, spleen, liver) bound to intracellular ferritin.  The body highly conserves iron (daily loss of 0.03%) requiring supplementation of about 1 mg/day to replenish losses in healthy, non-menstruating adults.  The etiology of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4146209" conceptname="Iron deficiency">iron deficiency</span> in hemodialysis patients is varied and can include blood loss and/or increased iron utilization (e.g., from epoetin therapy).  The administration of exogenous epoetin increases red blood cell production and iron utilization.  The increased iron utilization and blood losses in the hemodialysis patient may lead to absolute or functional <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4146209" conceptname="Iron deficiency">iron deficiency</span>.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4146209" conceptname="Iron deficiency">Iron deficiency</span> is absolute when hematological indicators of iron stores are low.  Patients with functional <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4146209" conceptname="Iron deficiency">iron deficiency</span> do not meet laboratory criteria for absolute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4146209" conceptname="Iron deficiency">iron deficiency</span> but demonstrate an increase in hemoglobin/hematocrit or a decrease in epoetin dosage with stable hemoglobin/hematocrit when parenteral iron is administered.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Multiple sequential single dose intravenous pharmacokinetic studies were performed on 14 healthy iron-deficient volunteers. Entry criteria included hemoglobin â‰¥ 10.5 g/dL and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306252" conceptname="Transferrin saturation">transferrin saturation</span> â‰¤ 15% (TSAT) or serum ferritin value â‰¤ 20 ng/mL. In the first stage, each subject was randomized 1:1 to undiluted sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection of either 125 mg/hr or 62.5 mg/0.5 hr (2.1 mg/min). Five days after the first stage, each subject was re-randomized 1:1 to undiluted sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection of either 125 mg/7 min or 62.5 mg/4 min (&gt;15.5 mg/min).</p>
<p>Peak drug levels (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) varied significantly by dosage and by rate of administration with the highest C<span class="Sub">max</span> observed in the regimen in which 125 mg was administered in 7 minutes (19.0 mg/L). The initial volume of distribution (V<span class="Sub">Ferr</span>) of 6 L corresponds well to calculated blood volume. V<span class="Sub">Ferr</span> did not vary by dosage or rate of administration. The terminal elimination half-life (Î»z-HL) for drug bound iron was approximately 1 hour. Î»z-HL varied by dose but not by rate of administration. The shortest value (0.85 h) occurred in the 62.5 mg/4 min regimen; the longest value (1.45 h) occurred in the 125 mg/7 min regimen. Total clearance of sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection was 3.02 to 5.35 L/h. There was no significant variation by rate of administration. The AUC for sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection bound iron varied by dose from 17.5 mg-h/L (62.5 mg) to 35.6 mg-h/L (125 mg). There was no significant variation by rate of administration. Approximately 80% of drug bound iron was delivered to transferrin as a mononuclear ionic iron species within 24 hours of administration in each dosage regimen. Direct movement of iron from sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection to transferrin was not observed. Mean peak <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306252" conceptname="Transferrin saturation">transferrin saturation</span> did not exceed 100% and returned to near baseline by 40 hours after administration of each dosage regimen.</p>

<h2>Pediatrics</h2>
<p class="First">Single dose intravenous pharmacokinetic analyses were performed on 48 iron-deficient pediatric hemodialysis patients. Twenty-two patients received 1.5 mg/kg sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection and 26 patients received 3.0 mg/kg sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection (maximum dose 125 mg). The mean C<span class="Sub">max</span>, AUC<span class="Sub">0-âˆž</span>, and terminal elimination half-life values for the 22 patients who received a 1.5 mg/kg dose were 12.9 mg/L, 95.0 mgâ€¢hr/L, and 2.0 hours, respectively. The mean C<span class="Sub">max</span>, AUC<span class="Sub">0-âˆž</span>, and terminal elimination half-life values for the 26 patients who received a 3.0 mg/kg dose were 22.8 mg/L, 170.9 mgâ€¢hr/L, and 2.5 hours, respectively.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> experiments have shown that less than 1% of the iron species within Nulecit<span class="Sup">TM</span> can be dialyzed through membranes with pore sizes corresponding to 12,000 to 14,000 daltons over a period of up to 270 minutes.  Human studies in renally competent patients suggest the clinical insignificance of urinary excretion.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Drug-drug Interactions:</span>  Drug-drug interactions involving Nulecit<span class="Sup">TM</span> have not been studied.  However, like other parenteral iron preparations, Nulecit<span class="Sup">TM</span> may be expected to reduce the absorption of concomitantly administered oral iron preparations.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First">Two clinical studies (Studies A and B) were conducted in adults and one clinical study was conducted in pediatric patients (Study C) to assess the efficacy and safety of sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Study A</span></span></p>
<p>Study A was a three-center, randomized, open-label study of the safety and efficacy of two doses of sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection administered intravenously to iron-deficient hemodialysis patients. The study included both a dose-response concurrent control and an historical control. Enrolled patients received a test dose of sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection (25 mg of elemental iron) and were then randomly assigned to receive sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection at cumulative doses of either 500 mg (low dose) or 1000 mg (high dose) of elemental iron. Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection was given to both dose groups in eight divided doses during sequential dialysis sessions (a period of 16 to 17 days). At each dialysis session, patients in the low-dose group received sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection 62.5 mg of elemental iron over 30 minutes, and those in the high-dose group received sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection 125 mg of elemental iron over 60 minutes. The primary endpoint was the change in hemoglobin from baseline to the last available observation through Day 40.</p>
<p>Eligibility for this study included chronic hemodialysis patients with a hemoglobin below 10 g/dL (or hematocrit at or below 32%) and either serum ferritin below 100 ng/mL or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306252" conceptname="Transferrin saturation">transferrin saturation</span> below 18%. Exclusion criteria included significant underlying disease or inflammatory conditions or an epoetin requirement of greater than 10,000 units three times per week. Parenteral iron and red cell transfusion were not allowed for two months before the study. Oral iron and red cell transfusion were not allowed during the study for sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection-treated patients.</p>
<p>The historical control population consisted of 25 chronic hemodialysis patients who received only oral iron supplementation for 14 months and did not receive red cell transfusion. All patients had stable epoetin doses and hematocrit values for at least two months before initiation of oral iron therapy.</p>
<p>The evaluated population consisted of 39 patients in the low-dose sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection group (50% female, 50% male; 74% white, 18% black, 5% Hispanic, 3% Asian; mean age 54 years, range 22 to 83 years), 44 patients in the high-dose sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection group (50% female, 48% male, 2% unknown; 75% white, 11% black, 5% Hispanic, 7% other, 2% unknown; mean age 56 years, range 20 to 87 years), and 25 historical control patients (68% female, 32% male; 40% white, 32% black, 20% Hispanic, 4% Asian, 4% unknown; mean age 52 years, range 25 to 84 years).</p>
<p>The mean baseline hemoglobin and hematocrit were similar between treatment and historical control patients: 9.8 g/dL and 29% and 9.6 g/dL and 29% in low- and high-dose sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection-treated patients, respectively, and 9.4 g/dL and 29% in historical control patients. Baseline serum <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306252" conceptname="Transferrin saturation">transferrin saturation</span> was 20% in the low-dose group, 16% in the high-dose group, and 14% in the historical control. Baseline serum ferritin was 106 ng/mL in the low-dose group, 88 ng/mL in the high-dose group, and 606 ng/mL in the historical control.</p>
<p>Patients in the high-dose sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection group achieved significantly higher increases in hemoglobin and hematocrit than either patients in the low-dose sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection group or patients in the historical control group (oral iron). Patients in the low-dose sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection group did not achieve significantly higher increases in hemoglobin and hematocrit than patients receiving oral iron. See Table 1.</p>

<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Study B</span></span></p>
<p>Study B was a single-center, non-randomized, open-label, historically-controlled, study of the safety and efficacy of variable, cumulative doses of intravenous sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection in iron-deficient hemodialysis patients. Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection administration was identical to Study A. The primary efficacy variable was the change in hemoglobin from baseline to the last available observation through Day 50.</p>
<p>Inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical to those of Study A as was the historical control population. Sixty-three patients were evaluated in this study: 38 in the sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection-treated group (37% female, 63% male; 95% white, 5% Asian; mean age 56 years, range 22 to 84 years) and 25 in the historical control group (68% female, 32% male; 40% white, 32% black, 20% Hispanic, 4% Asian, 4% unknown; mean age 52 years, range 25 to 84 years).</p>
<p>Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection-treated patients were considered to have completed the study per protocol if they received at least eight sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection doses of either 62.5 mg or 125 mg of elemental iron. A total of 14 patients (37%) completed the study per protocol. Twelve (32%) sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection -treated patients received less than eight doses, and 12 (32%) patients had incomplete information on the sequence of dosing. Not all patients received sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection at consecutive dialysis sessions and many received oral iron during the study.</p>

<p>Baseline hemoglobin and hematocrit values were similar between the treatment and control groups, and were 9.1 g/dL and 27.3%, respectively, for sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection-treated patients. Serum iron studies were also similar between treatment and control groups, with the exception of serum ferritin, which was 606 ng/mL for historical control patients, compared to 77 ng/mL for sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection -treated patients. In this patient population, only the sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection-treated group achieved significant increase in hemoglobin and hematocrit from baseline. This increase was significantly greater than that seen in the historical oral iron treatment group. See Table 2.</p>

<p>Study C was a multicenter, randomized, open-label study of the safety and efficacy of two sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection dose regimens (1.5 mg/kg or 3.0 mg/kg of elemental iron) administered intravenously to 66 iron-deficient (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306252" conceptname="Transferrin saturation">transferrin saturation</span> &lt; 20% and/or serum ferritin &lt; 100 ng/mL) pediatric hemodialysis patients, 6 to 15 years of age, inclusive who were receiving a stable erythropoietin dosing regimen.</p>
<p>Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg or 3.0 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 125 mg of elemental iron) in 25 mL 0.9% sodium chloride was infused intravenously over 1 hour during each hemodialysis session for eight sequential dialysis sessions. Thirty-two patients received the 1.5 mg/kg dosing regimen (47% male, 53% female; 66% Caucasian, 25% Hispanic, and 3% Black, Asian, or Other; mean age 12.3 years).

<h2>Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Long term carcinogenicity studies in animals were not performed.  Studies to assess the effects of sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection on fertility were not conducted.  Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection was not mutagenic in the Ames test and the rat micronucleus test.

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.  Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.  In particular, 51/159 hemodialysis patients in North American clinical studies were aged 65 years or older.  Among these patients, no differences in safety or efficacy as a result of age were identified.  In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Exposure to sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection has been documented in over 1,400 patients on hemodialysis.  This population included 1,097 sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection-naÃ¯ve patients who received a single-dose of sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection in a placebo-controlled, cross-over, post-marketing safety study.  Undiluted sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection was administered over ten minutes (125 mg of elemental iron at 12.5 mg/min).  No test dose was used.  From a total of 1,498 sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection-treated patients in medical reports, North American trials, and post-marketing studies, twelve patients (0.8%) experienced serious reactions which precluded further therapy with sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">The dosage of Nulecit<span class="Sup">TM</span> is expressed in terms of mg of elemental iron.  Each 5 mL vial contains 62.5 mg of elemental iron (12.5 mg/mL).  </p>
<p>The recommended dosage of Nulecit<span class="Sup">TM</span> for the repletion treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4146209" conceptname="Iron deficiency">iron deficiency</span> in hemodialysis patients is 10 mL of sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection (125 mg of elemental iron).  Nulecit<span class="Sup">TM</span> may be diluted in 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride administered by intravenous infusion over 1 hour.  Nulecit<span class="Sup">TM</span> may also be administered undiluted as a slow IV injection (at a rate of up to 12.5 mg/min).  Most patients will require a minimum cumulative dose of 1.0 gram of elemental iron, administered over eight sessions at sequential dialysis treatments, to achieve a favorable hemoglobin or hematocrit response.  Patients may continue to require therapy with intravenous iron at the lowest dose necessary to maintain target levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and laboratory parameters of iron storage within acceptable limits.  Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection has been administered at sequential dialysis sessions by infusion or by slow IV injection during the dialysis session itself.</p>
<p>Data from sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection postmarketing spontaneous reports indicate that individual doses exceeding 125 mg may be associated with a higher incidence and/or severity of adverse events.  See <a href="#LINK_bbd2a99b-544e-4ec2-90b8-021f140a5996">OVERDOSAGE.</a></p>

The maximum dosage should not exceed 125 mg per dose. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Note: </span> Do not mix Nulecit<span class="Sup">TM</span> with other medications, or add to parenteral nutrition solutions for intravenous infusion.  The compatibility of Nulecit<span class="Sup">TM</span> with intravenous infusion vehicles other than 0.9% sodium chloride has not been evaluated.  Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration before administration, whenever the solution and container permit.</p>
