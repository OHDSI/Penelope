<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"><a name="inv-5203a680-fe84-4858-88cc-fca10b1b19b1"></a>Both components of chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets exert their action in the central nervous system. Extensive studies with chlordiazepoxide in many animal species suggest action in the limbic system. Recent evidence indicates that the limbic system is involved in emotional response. Taming action was observed in some species. The mechanism of action of amitriptyline in man is not known, but the drug appears to interfere with the reuptake of norepinephrine into adrenergic nerve endings. This action may prolong the sympathetic activity of biogenic amines. </p>

<h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h1>
<p class="First"><a name="inv-066d1acf-ff67-4b7c-9c36-c9f816cf2d76"></a>Chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> to either benzodiazepines or tricyclic antidepressants. It should not be given concomitantly with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. Hyperpyretic crises, severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> have occurred in patients receiving a tricyclic antidepressant and a monoamine oxidase inhibitor simultaneously. When it is desired to replace a monoamine oxidase inhibitor with chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride, a minimum of 14 days should be allowed to elapse after the former is discontinued. Chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride should then be initiated cautiously with gradual increase in dosage until optimum response is achieved. </p>

Pooled analyses of short-term placebo controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18-24) with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. </p>

The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but the tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in <span class="Bold">Table 1.</span></p>

<h2>Drug and Treatment Interactions</h2>
<p class="First"><a name="inv-6b3b640b-7371-4d12-b949-ef18c306d1d5"></a>Because of its amitriptyline component, chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride may block the antihypertensive action of guanethidine or compounds with a similar mechanism of action.</p>
<p><a name="inv-479a30eb-1050-43ef-a4ef-98a3eeb48dcd"></a><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6: </span></span>The biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase) is reduced in a subset of the Caucasian population (about 7% to 10% of Caucasians are so called â€œpoor metabolizersâ€?); reliable estimates of the prevalence of reduced P450 2D6 isozyme activity among Asian, African and other populations are not yet available. Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) when given usual doses. Depending on the fraction of drug metabolized by P450 2D6, the increase in plasma concentration may be small or quite large (8-fold increase in plasma AUC of the TCA).</p>
<p><a name="inv-06ac0162-581f-4475-90d9-d15be75f0c51"></a>In addition, certain drugs inhibit the activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers. An individual who is stable on a given dose of TCA may become abruptly toxic when given one of these inhibiting drugs as concomitant therapy. The drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 include some that are not metabolized by the enzyme (quinidine; cimetidine) and many that are substrates for P450 2D6 (many other antidepressants, phenothiazines, and the type 1c antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide). While all the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline and paroxetine, inhibit P450 2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition. The extent to which SSRI TCA interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the coadministration of TCAs with any of the SSRIs and also in switching from one class to the other. Of particular importance, sufficient time must elapse before initiating TCA treatment in a patient being withdrawn from fluoxetine, given the long half-life of the parent and active metabolite (at least 5 weeks may be necessary).</p>
<p><a name="inv-ed8c4102-77a0-42d4-9c1d-7a99e7078218"></a>Concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the tricyclic antidepressant or the other drug. Furthermore, whenever one of these other drugs is withdrawn from cotherapy, an increased dose of tricyclic antidepressant may be required. It is desirable to monitor TCA plasma levels whenever a TCA is going to be coadministered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6. </p>
<p><a name="inv-0b1f9f06-da39-439e-bb2a-8e7eb34f75f2"></a>The effects of concomitant administration of chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride and other psychotropic drugs have not been evaluated. Sedative effects may be additive.</p>
<p><a name="inv-f0ed4c3b-8f49-4974-adec-a069c5e1ba4a"></a>Cimetidine is reported to reduce hepatic metabolism of certain tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines, thereby delaying elimination and increasing steady-state concentrations of these drugs. Clinically significant effects have been reported with the tricyclic antidepressants when used concomitantly with cimetidine (Tagamet<span class="Sup">Â®</span>).</p>
<p><a name="inv-6f48adce-63ee-4bb5-a9fc-61531cb4cd54"></a>The drug should be discontinued several days before elective surgery.</p>
<p><a name="inv-97bf15a2-5d1e-4650-b825-772c735af1b0"></a>Concurrent administration of ECT and chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride should be limited to those patients for whom it is essential.</p>

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First"><a name="inv-9adeeae0-9ed4-45e6-8c46-f2b50ba2a9e4"></a>Optimum dosage varies with the severity of the symptoms and the response of the individual patient. When a satisfactory response is obtained, dosage should be reduced to the smallest amount needed to maintain the remission. The larger portion of the total daily dose may be taken at bedtime. In some patients, a single dose at bedtime may be sufficient. In general, lower dosages are recommended for elderly patients.</p>
<p><a name="inv-f7b6c9a8-98b8-48c8-8aa7-1d80b8336bd0"></a>Chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets are recommended in an initial dosage of 3 or 4 tablets daily in divided doses; this may be increased to 6 tablets daily as required. Some patients respond to smaller doses and can be maintained on 2 tablets daily. </p>
