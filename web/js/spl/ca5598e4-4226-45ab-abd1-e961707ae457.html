<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<span class="Bold">
              Perphenazine<br></span>In common with all members of the piperazine group of phenothiazine derivatives, perphenazine has greater behavioral potency than phenothiazine derivatives of other groups without a corresponding increase in autonomic, hematologic, or hepatic side effects.<br>Extrapyramidal effects, however, may occur more frequently. These effects are interpreted as neuropharmacologic. They usually regress after discontinuation of the drug.<br>Perphenazine is a potent tranquilizer and also a potent antiemetic. Orally, its milligram potency is about 5 or 6 times that of chlorpromazine with respect to behavioral effects. It is capable of alleviating symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4200706" conceptname="Tension">tension</span>, psychomotor <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">excitement</span>, and other manifestations of emotional stress without apparent dulling of mental acuity.<br><br><span class="Bold">
              Amitriptyline Hydrochloride<br></span>Amitriptyline hydrochloride is an antidepressant with sedative effects. Its mechanism of action in man is not known. It is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and it does not act primarily by stimulation of the central nervous system.<br><br>

<h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h1>
<br>It should not be given concomitantly with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Hyperpyretic crises, severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> have occurred in patients receiving tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors simultaneously. When it is desired to replace a monoamine oxidase inhibitor with perphenazine and amitriptyline hydrochloride, a minimum of 14 days should be allowed to elapse after the former is discontinued. Perphenazine and amitriptyline hydrochloride should then be initiated cautiously with gradual increase in dosage until optimum response is achieved.<br>Amitriptyline hydrochloride is not recommended for use during the acute recovery phase following <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>.<br><br>

The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications.

However, as with other phenothiazine compounds, patients receiving perphenazine in any dosage should be kept under close supervision.<br>The antiemetic effect of perphenazine may obscure signs of toxicity due to overdosage of other drugs, or render more difficult the diagnosis of disorders such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4116092" conceptname="Intracranial tumor">brain tumors</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="193518" conceptname="Intestinal obstruction">intestinal obstruction</span>.<br>A significant, not otherwise explained, rise in body temperature may suggest individual intolerance to perphenazine, in which case this product should be discontinued.<br>Neuroleptic drugs elevate prolactin levels; the elevation persists during chronic administration.

<h1>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</h1>
            While on therapy with perphenazine and amitriptyline hydrochloride, patients should be advised as to the possible impairment of mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle.<br>Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with perphenazine and amitriptyline hydrochloride and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide aboutAntidepressant Medicines, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> and other Serious Mental Illnesses and Suicidal Thoughts or Actionsis available for perphenazine and amitriptyline hydrochloride.

<h1>DRUG INTERACTIONS</h1>
<br><span class="Bold">
              Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6<br></span><br>In addition, certain drugs inhibit the activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers. An individual who is stable on a given dose of TCA may become abruptly toxic when given one of these inhibiting drugs as concomitant therapy. The drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 include some that are not metabolized by the enzyme (quinidine; cimetidine) and many that are substrates for P450 2D6 (many other antidepressants, phenothiazines, and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide). While all the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine, inhibit P450 2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition. The extent to which SSRI TCA interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the coadministration of TCAs with any of the SSRIs and also in switching from one class to the other. Of particular importance, sufficient time must elapse before initiating TCA treatment in a patient being withdrawn from fluoxetine, given the long half-life of the parent and active metabolite (at least 5 weeks may be necessary).<br>Concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the tricyclic antidepressant or the other drug. Furthermore, whenever one of these other drugs is withdrawn from cotherapy, an increased dose of tricyclic antidepressant may be required. It is desirable to monitor TCA plasma levels whenever a TCA is going to be coadministered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6.<br><br><span class="Bold">
              Perphenazine<br></span>Patients on large doses of a phenothiazine drug who are undergoing surgery should be watched carefully for possible hypotensive phenomena. Moreover, reduced amounts of anesthetics or central nervous system depressants may be necessary.<br>Since phenothiazines and central nervous system depressants (opiates, analgesics, antihistamines, barbiturates) can potentiate each other, less than the usual dosage of the added drug is recommended and caution is advised when they are administered concomitantly.<br>Use with caution in patients who are receiving atropine or related drugs because of the additive anticholinergic effects and also in patients who will be exposed to extreme heat or organic phosphate insecticides.<br>The use of alcohol should be avoided, since additive effects and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> may occur. Patients should be cautioned that their response to alcohol may be increased while they are being treated with perphenazine and amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets.

Such treatment should be limited to patients for whom it is essential.<br>Discontinue the drug several days before elective surgery, if possible.<br>Concurrent administration of cimetidine and tricyclic antidepressants can produce clinically significant increases in the plasma concentrations of the tricyclic antidepressant.

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
            To date, clinical evaluation of perphenazine has not revealed any adverse reactions peculiar to the combination. The adverse reactions that occurred were limited to those that have been reported previously for perphenazine and amitriptyline.<br>Treatment with perphenazine and amitriptyline hydrochloride is commonly associated with sedation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, neurological impairments and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226991" conceptname="Aptyalism">dry mouth</span>.<br><br><span class="Bold">
              Perphenazine<br></span>The common acute neurological effects of neuroleptic drugs, including perphenazine, consist of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375800" conceptname="Dystonia">dystonia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4108925" conceptname="Akathisia">akathisia</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">motor restlessness</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4140090" conceptname="Parkinsonism">pseudoparkinsonism</span>.<br>More chronic use of neuroleptics may be associated with the development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>. The salient features of this syndrome are described in the<span class="Underline">WARNINGS</span>section and below.<br>The following adverse reactions have been reported and, within each category, are listed in order of decreasing severity.<br><br><span class="Bold">

The severity of the syndrome and the degree of impairment produced vary widely.<br>The syndrome may become clinically recognizable either during treatment, upon dosage reduction, or upon withdrawal of treatment. Movements may decrease in intensity and may disappear altogether if further treatment with neuroleptics is withheld. It is generally believed that reversibility is more likely after short rather than long term neuroleptic exposure. Consequently, early detection of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> is important. To increase the likelihood of detecting the syndrome at the earliest possible time, the dosage of neuroleptic drug should be reduced periodically (if clinically possible) and the patient observed for signs of the disorder. It has been suggested that fine vermicular movements of the tongue may be an early sign of the syndrome, and that the full blown syndrome may not develop if medication is stopped when lingual vermiculation appears.<br>     1. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375800" conceptname="Dystonia">Dystonia</span>:Class Effect: Symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375800" conceptname="Dystonia">dystonia</span>, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment.

              Maintenance Dosage<br></span>Depending on the condition being treated, therapeutic response may take from a few days to a few weeks or even longer. After a satisfactory response is noted, dosage should be reduced to the smallest amount necessary to obtain relief from the symptoms for which this product is being administered. A useful maintenance dosage is one tablet of the 2 mg/25 mg or 4 mg/25 mg combination two to four times a day or one tablet of the 4 mg/50 mg combination twice a day. Perphenazine and amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets, 2 mg/10 mg and 4 mg/10 mg can be used to increase flexibility in adjusting maintenance dosage to the lowest amount consistent with relief of symptoms. In some patients, maintenance dosage is required for many months.<br><br>
