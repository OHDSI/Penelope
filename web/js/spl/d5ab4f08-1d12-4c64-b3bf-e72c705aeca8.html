<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<span class="Bold">
              PHARMACODYNAMICS<br></span>Tramadol Hydrochloride contains tramadol, a centrally acting synthetic opioid analgesic. Although its mode of action is not completely understood, from animal tests, at least two complementary mechanisms appear applicable: binding of parent and M1 metabolite toreceptors and weak inhibition of re-uptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.<br>Opioid activity is due to both low affinity binding of the parent compound and higher affinity binding of the O-demethylated metabolite M1 toreceptors. In animal models, M1 is up to 6 times more potent than tramadol in producing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> and 200 times more potent inbinding. Tramadol-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> is only partially antagonized by the opiate antagonist naloxone in several animal tests. The relative contribution of both tramadol and M1 to human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> is dependent upon the plasma concentrations of each compound (see<span class="Underline">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics</span>).<br>Tramadol has been shown to inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in vitro, as have some other opioid analgesics. These mechanisms may contribute independently to the overall analgesic profile of tramadol hydrochloride. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">Analgesia</span> in humans begins approximately within one hour after administration and reaches a peak in approximately two to three hours.<br>Apart from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, tramadol hydrochloride administration may produce a constellation of symptoms (including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">constipation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span>) similar to that of other opioids. In contrast to morphine, tramadol has not been shown to cause histamine release. At therapeutic doses, tramadol hydrochloride has no effect on heart rate, left-ventricular function or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208254" conceptname="Cardiac index">cardiac index</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">Orthostatic hypotension</span> has been observed.<br><br><span class="Bold">
              PHARMACOKINETICS<br></span>The analgesic activity of tramadol hydrochloride is due to both parent drug and the M1 metabolite (see<span class="Underline">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacodynamics</span>). Tramadol is administered as a racemate and both the [-] and [+] forms of both tramadol and M1 are detected in the circulation. Linear pharmacokinetics have been observed following multiple doses of 50 and 100 mg to steady-state.<br>Absorption<br>The mean absolute bioavailability of a 100 mg oral dose is approximately 75%. The mean peak plasma concentration of racemic tramadol and M1 occurs at two and three hours, respectively, after administration in healthy adults. In general, both enantiomers of tramadol and M1 follow a parallel time course in the body following single and multiple doses although small differences (10%) exist in the absolute amount of each enantiomer present.<br>Steady-state plasma concentrations of both tramadol and M1 are achieved within two days with four times per day dosing. There is no evidence of self-induction (see Figure 1 and Table 1 below).<br>Figure 1: Mean Tramadol and M1 Plasma Concentration Profiles after a Single 100 mg Oral Dose and after Twenty-Nine 100 mg Oral Doses of Tramadol HCl given four times per year<br><div class="Figure"><img alt="MM3" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=d5ab4f08-1d12-4c64-b3bf-e72c705aeca8&amp;name=MM3.jpg"></div>

The binding of tramadol to human plasma proteins is approximately 20% and binding also appears to be independent of concentration up to 10Saturation of plasma protein binding occurs only at concentrations outside the clinically relevant range.<br>Metabolism<br>Tramadol is extensively metabolized after oral administration by a number of pathways, including CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, as well as by conjugation of parent and metabolites. Approximately 30% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug, whereas 60% of the dose is excreted as metabolites. The remainder is excreted either as unidentified or as unextractable metabolites. The major metabolic pathways appear to be N- and O-demethylation and glucuronidation or sulfation in the liver. One metabolite (O-desmethyltramadol, denoted M1) is pharmacologically active in animal models. Formation of M1 is dependent on CYP2D6 and as such is subject to inhibition, which may affect the therapeutic response (see<span class="Underline">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interaction</span>).<br>Approximately 7% of the population has reduced activity of the CYP2D6 isoenzyme of cytochrome P-450. These individuals are "poor metabolizers" of debrisoquine, dextromethorphan, tricyclic antidepressants, among other drugs. Based on a population PK analysis of Phase I studies in healthy subjects, concentrations of tramadol were approximately 20% higher in "poor metabolizers" versus "extensive metabolizers", while M1 concentrations were 40% lower. Concomitant therapy with inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as fluoxetine, paroxetine and quinidine could result in significant drug interactions. In vitro drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as fluoxetine and its metabolite norfluoxetine, amitriptyline and quinidine inhibit the metabolism of tramadol to various degrees, suggesting that concomitant administration of these compounds could result in increases in tramadol concentrations and decreased concentrations of M1. The full pharmacological impact of these alterations in terms of either efficacy or safety is unknown. Concomitant use of SEROTONIN re-uptake INHIBITORS and MAO INHIBITORS may enhance the risk of adverse events, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> (see<span class="Underline">WARNINGS</span>) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span>.<br>Elimination<br>Tramadol is eliminated primarily through metabolism by the liver and the metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys. The mean terminal plasma elimination half-lives of racemic tramadol and racemic M1 are 6.31.4 and 7.41.4 hours, respectively. The plasma elimination half-life of racemic tramadol increased from approximately six hours to seven hours upon multiple dosing.<br><br><span class="Bold">

In patients with creatinine clearances of less than 30 mL/min, adjustment of the dosing regimen is recommended (see<span class="Underline">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>). The total amount of tramadol and M1 removed during a 4-hour dialysis period is less than 7% of the administered dose.<br>Hepatic<br>Metabolism of tramadol and M1 is reduced in patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver, resulting in both a larger area under the concentration time curve for tramadol and longer tramadol and M1 elimination half-lives (13 hrs. for tramadol and 19 hrs. for M1). In cirrhotic patients, adjustment of the dosing regimen is recommended (see<span class="Underline">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).<br>Geriatric<br>Healthy elderly subjects aged 65 to 75 years have plasma tramadol concentrations and elimination half-lives comparable to those observed in healthy subjects less than 65 years of age. In subjects over 75 years, maximum serum concentrations are elevated (208 vs. 162 ng/mL) and the elimination half-life is prolonged (7 vs. 6 hours) compared to subjects 65 to 75 years of age. Adjustment of the daily dose is recommended for patients older than 75 years (see<span class="Underline">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).<br>Gender<br>The absolute bioavailability of tramadol was 73% in males and 79% in females. The plasma clearance was 6.4 mL/min/kg in males and 5.7 mL/min/kg in females following a 100 mg IV dose of tramadol. Following a single oral dose, and after adjusting for body weight, females had a 12% higher peak tramadol concentration and a 35% higher area under the concentration-time curve compared to males. The clinical significance of this difference is unknown.<br><br>

Caution is advised when tramadol hydrochloride is coadministered with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, such as SSRIs, MAOIs, triptans, linezolid (an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), lithium, or St. John's Wort. If concomitant treatment of tramadol hydrochloride with a drug affecting the serotonergic neurotransmitter system is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases (see<span class="Underline">WARNINGS, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">Serotonin Syndrome</span></span>).<br>Triptans<br>Based on the mechanism of action of tramadol and the potential for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span>, caution is advised when tramadol hydrochloride is coadministered with a triptan.

<h1>CARCINOGENESIS &amp; MUTAGENESIS &amp; IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY</h1>
            A slight, but statistically significant, increase in two common murine tumors, pulmonary and hepatic, was observed in a mouse carcinogenicity study, particularly in aged mice. Mice were dosed orally up to 30 mg/kg (90 mg/m2 or 0.36 times the maximum daily human dosage of 246 mg/m2) for approximately two years, although the study was not done with the Maximum Tolerated Dose. This finding is not believed to suggest risk in humans. No such finding occurred in a rat carcinogenicity study (dosing orally up to 30 mg/kg, 180 mg/m2, or 0.73 times the maximum daily human dosage).<br>Tramadol was not mutagenic in the following assays: Ames <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span> microsomal activation test, CHO/HPRT mammalian cell assay, mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> assay (in the absence of metabolic activation), dominant lethal mutation tests in mice, chromosome aberration test in Chinese hamsters, and bone marrow micronucleus tests in mice and Chinese hamsters.

phosphate 30 mg), and aspirin 325 mg with codeine phosphate 30 mg, however, the rates of withdrawals due to adverse events appeared to be higher in the tramadol hydrochloride groups.<br>Table 2:

Thereafter the total daily dose may be increased by 50 mg as tolerated every 3 days to reach 200 mg/day (50 mg q.i.d.).

<dd>Â Â Â Â Â In all patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, it is recommended that the dosing interval of tramadol hydrochloride tablets be increased to 12 hours, with a maximum daily dose of 200 mg. Since only 7% of an administered dose is removed by hemodialysis, dialysis patients can receive their regular dose on the day of dialysis.
