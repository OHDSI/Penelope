<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span> is a product containing a highly purified preparation of human follicle stimulating hormone (hFSH) extracted from the urine of postmenopausal women. Human FSH consists of two non-covalently linked glycoproteins designated as the α and β subunits. The α subunit has 92 amino acids of which two are modified by attachment of carbohydrates. The β subunit has 111 amino acids of which two are modified by attachment of carbohydrates.</p>
<p>Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span> is a sterile, lyophilize powder intended for subcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular (IM) injection after reconstitution with sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Each vial of Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span> contains 82.5 International Units (IU) of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) activity, 23 mg Lactose Monohydrate, 0.005 mg Polysorbate 20, and Sodium Phosphate buffer (Sodium Phosphate dibasic, Heptahydrate and Phosphoric acid) for pH adjustments, which, when reconstituted with diluent, will deliver 75 IU of FSH. Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span> contains up to 2% luteinizing hormone (LH) activity based on bioassay. Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) is not detected in Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span>. When stored at 3° to 25°C, up to 40% of the α subunits may be oxidized.</p>
<p>The in vivo biological activity of urofollitropin for injection, purified is determined by using reference standards calibrated against the First International Standard for follicle-stimulating hormone, (FSH, Urofollitropin), Urinary, Human for Bioassay, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) at its 46th meeting in 1995.</p>
<p>FSH is a glycoprotein that is acidic and water-soluble.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span> administered for 7 to 12 days produces ovarian follicular growth in women who do not have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="193739" conceptname="Ovarian failure">primary ovarian failure</span>. Treatment with Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span> in most instances results only in follicular growth and maturation. When sufficient follicular maturation has occurred, hCG must be given to induce ovulation.</p>

<h2>PHARMACOKINETICS</h2>
<p class="First">Single doses of 225 IU and multiple daily doses (7 days) of 150 IU of Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span> were administered to healthy volunteer female subjects while their endogenous FSH was suppressed. Sixteen subjects received Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span> SC and 12 received the drug IM. Serum FSH concentrations were determined. Based on the steady state ratio of FSH Cmax and AUC, SC and IM administration of Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span> were not bioequivalent. Multiple doses of Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span> IM resulted in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of 77.7% and 81.8% compared to multiple doses of Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span> SC. The FSH pharmacokinetic parameters for single and multiple dose Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span>, administered SC and IM are in Table 1.</p>

<h2>Selection of Patients</h2>
<ol>
<li>Before treatment with Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span> is instituted, a thorough gynecologic and endocrinologic evaluation must be performed. Except for those patients enrolled in an <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>fertilization program, this should include a hysterosalpingography (to rule out uterine and tubal pathology) and documentation of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4144685" conceptname="Anovulation">anovulation</span> by means of basal body temperature, serial vaginal smears, examination of cervical mucus, determination of serum (or urine) progesterone, urinary pregnanediol and endometrial biopsy. Patients with tubal pathology should receive Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span> only if enrolled in an <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>fertilization program.<br>
</li>
<li><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="193739" conceptname="Ovarian failure">Primary ovarian failure</span> should be excluded by the determination of gonadotropin levels.<br>

<p>In a clinical study of ovulation induction, 6 of 72 (8.33%) Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span> treated women developed OHSS and two were classified as severe. In a clinical study for multiple follicular development during IVF, 3 of 60 Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span> treated women developed OHSS and 1 was classified as severe. Cases of OHSS are more common, more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. OHSS develops rapidly; therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration. Most often, OHSS occurs after treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about 7 to 10 days after treatment. Usually, in cases where OHSS may be developing prior to hCG administration (see <a href="#D3037AD2-B468-487C-88FA-B0B1987F7D5E">PRECAUTIONS - Laboratory Tests</a>), the hCG should be withheld.</p>
<p>If severe OHSS occurs, treatment <span class="Italics">must </span>be stopped and the patient should be hospitalized.</p>
<p>A physician experienced in the management of the syndrome, or who is experienced in the management of fluid and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022093" conceptname="Electrolyte imbalance">electrolyte imbalances</span> should be consulted.</p>

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Prior to therapy with Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span> patients should be informed of the duration of treatment and the monitoring of their condition that will be required. Possible adverse reactions (see <a href="#D3ADF887-C108-41E5-9891-7FE9A432FA43">ADVERSE REACTIONS </a>section) and the risk of multiple births should also be discussed.</p>

<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">The combination of both estradiol levels and ultrasonography are useful for monitoring the growth and development of follicles, timing hCG administration, as well as minimizing the risk of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4305298" conceptname="Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome">Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432969" conceptname="Multiple pregnancy">multiple gestations</span>.</p>
<p>The clinical confirmation of ovulation, is determined by:</p>
<p>a. A rise in basal body temperature,<br>b. Increase in serum progesterone, and<br>c. Menstruation following the shift in basal body temperature.</p>
<p>When used in conjunction with indices of progesterone production, sonographic visualization of the ovaries will assist in determining if ovulation has occurred. Sonographic evidence of ovulation may include the following:</p>
<p>a. Fluid in the cul-de-sac, <br>b. Ovarian stigmata, and <br>c. Collapsed follicle.</p>
<p>Because of the subjectivity of the various tests for the determination of follicular maturation and ovulation, it cannot be overemphasized that the physician should choose tests with which he/she is thoroughly familiar.</p>

The lowest dose consistent with achieving good results based on clinical experience and reported clinical data should be used.</p>
<p>The recommended initial dose of Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span> for patients who have received GnRH agonist or antagonist pituitary suppression is 150 IU daily administered SC or IM for the first 5 days of treatment. Based on clinical monitoring (including serum estradiol levels and vaginal ultrasound results) subsequent dosing should be adjusted according to individual patient response.

<p>If patient response to Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span> is appropriate, hCG (5000 to 10,000 USP units) should be given 1 day following the last dose of Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span>.

Patients should be followed closely for at least 2 weeks after hCG administration. If there is inadequate follicle development or ovulation without subsequent pregnancy, the course of treatment with Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span>may be repeated. The couple should be encouraged to have intercourse daily, beginning on the day prior to the administration of hCG until ovulation becomes apparent from the indices employed for the determination of progestational, activity. In the light of the foregoing indices and parameters mentioned, it should become obvious that, unless a physician is willing to devote considerable time to these patients and be familiar with and conduct the necessary laboratory studies, he/she should not use Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span>.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Assisted Reproductive Technologies: </span>The recommended initial dose of Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span> for patients undergoing IVF and donor egg patients who have received GnRH agonist or antagonist pituitary suppression is 225 IU daily administered SC for the first 5 days of treatment. Based on clinical monitoring (including serum estradiol levels and vaginal ultrasound results) subsequent dosing should be adjusted according to individual patient response. Adjustments in dose should not be made more frequently than once every 2 days and should not exceed more than 75 to 150 IU per adjustment. The maximum daily dose of Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span> given should not exceed 450 IU and in most cases dosing beyond 12 days is not recommended.</p>
<p>Once adequate follicular development is evident, hCG (5,000-10,000 USP units) should be administered to induce final follicular maturation in preparation for oocyte retrieval. The administration of hCG must be withheld in cases where the ovaries are abnormally enlarged on the last day of therapy. This should reduce the chance of developing OHSS.</p>

<h2>Directions for Using Bravelle®</h2>
<p class="First">1)     Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water.<br>2)     Before injections, the septum tops of the vials should be wiped with an aseptic solution<br>        to prevent contamination of the contents.<br>3)     To prepare the Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span> solution, inject 1 mL of Sterile Saline for Injection, USP into the<br>        vial of Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span>. <span class="Bold">DO NOT </span><span class="Bold">SHAKE, </span>but gently swirl until the solution is clear. Generally,<br>        the Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span> dissolves immediately. Check the liquid in the container. If it is not clear or<br>        has particles in it, <span class="Bold">DO NOT USE </span><span class="Bold">IT.<br></span>4)     For patients requiring a single injection from multiple vials of Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span>, up to 6 vials can be<br>        reconstituted with 1 mL of Sterile Saline for Injection, USP. This can be accomplished by<br>        reconstituting a single vial as described above (see step 3). Then draw the entire contents of<br>        the first vial into a syringe, and inject the contents into a second vial of lyophilized Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span>.<br>        Gently swirl the second vial, as described above, once again checking to make sure the solution<br>        is clear and free of particles. This step can be repeated with 4 additional vials for a total of up<br>        to 6 vials of lyophilized Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span> into 1 mL of diluent.<br>5)     Immediately <span class="Bold">ADMINISTER </span>the reconstituted Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span> either <span class="Bold">SC</span> (for ovulation induction or<br>        multifollicular development during ART) or <span class="Bold">IM </span>(for ovulation induction). Any unused reconstituted<br>        material should be discarded.<br>6)     Draw the reconstituted Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span> into an empty, sterile syringe.<br>7)     Hold the syringe pointing upwards and gently tap the side to force any air bubbles to the top;<br>        then squeeze the plunger gently until all the air has been expelled and only Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span> solution is<br>        left in the syringe.<br>8)     Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span> works if it is injected <span class="Bold">SC</span> (for ovulation induction or multifollicular development during<br>        ART) or <span class="Bold">IM </span>(for ovulation induction). The recommended sites for SC injection are either side of<br>        the lower abdomen in alternating fashion with the actual injection site varied a little with each<br>        injection. SC injection of Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span> into the thigh is not recommended unless the lower abdomen<br>        is not usable because of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4050007" conceptname="Scar">scarring</span>, surgical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168498" conceptname="Deformity">deformity</span> or other medical conditions.</p>
<p>The best site for IM injection of Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span> is the upper outer quadrant of the buttock muscle near the hip. This area contains few blood vessels and major nerves. Stretching the skin helps the needle to go in more easily and pushes the tissue beneath the skin out of the way. This helps the solution disperse correctly.</p>
<p>9)     The injection site should be swabbed with a disinfectant to remove any surface bacteria. Clean<br>        about two inches around the point where the needle will go in and let the disinfectant dry for<br>        at least one minute before proceeding.<br>10)    For <span class="Bold">SC</span> injection, the needle should be inserted at a 90° angle to the skin surface.</p>
<p>For <span class="Bold">IM </span>injection, the needle should be inserted at a 90° angle to the skin surface. Pushing in with a quick thrust causes the least <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090431" conceptname="Discomfort">discomfort</span>.</p>
<p>11)    If the needle is correctly positioned, it will be difficult to draw back on the plunger. Any blood<br>        drawn into the syringe means the needle tip has penetrated a vein or artery. If this happens,<br>         remove the syringe, cover the injection site with a swab containing disinfectant and apply<br>         pressure; the site should stop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> in a minute or two.<br>12)    Once the needle is properly placed, depress the plunger <span class="Bold">slowly </span>and steadily, so the solution<br>         is correctly injected and the skin or muscle tissue is not damaged.<br>13)    Pull the syringe out quickly and apply pressure to the site with a swab containing disinfectant.<br>         A gentle massage of the site - while still maintaining pressure - helps disperse the Bravelle<span class="Sup">®</span><br>         solution and relieve any <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090431" conceptname="Discomfort">discomfort</span>.<br>14)    Use the disposable syringe only once and dispose of it properly.</p>
