<p>Omeprazole is a white to off-white crystalline powder that melts with 
decomposition at about 155Â°C. It is a weak base, freely soluble in ethanol and 
methanol, and slightly soluble in acetone and isopropanol and very slightly 
soluble in water. The stability of omeprazole is a function of pH; it is rapidly 
degraded in acid media, but has acceptable stability under alkaline conditions.

<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a>12.1 Mechanism of Action<p class="First">Omeprazole belongs to a class of antisecretory compounds, the 
substituted benzimidazoles, that suppress gastric acid secretion by specific 
inhibition of the H<span class="Sup">+</span>/K<span class="Sup">+</span> ATPase 
enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because 
this enzyme system is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the gastric 
mucosa, omeprazole has been characterized as a gastric acid-pump inhibitor, in 
that it blocks the final step of acid production. This effect is dose-related 
and leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion irrespective 
of the stimulus. Animal studies indicate that after rapid disappearance from 
plasma, omeprazole can be found within the gastric mucosa for a day or 
more.</p>
<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a>12.2 Pharmacodynamics<p><span class="Italics">Antisecretory Activity</span></p>
<p>After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory effect of 
omeprazole occurs within one hour, with the maximum effect occurring within two 
hours. Inhibition of secretion is about 50% of maximum at 24 hours and the 
duration of inhibition lasts up to 72 hours. The antisecretory effect thus lasts 
far longer than would be expected from the very short (less than one hour) 
plasma half-life, apparently due to prolonged binding to the parietal H<span class="Sup">+</span>/K<span class="Sup">+</span> ATPase enzyme. When the drug is 
discontinued, secretory activity returns gradually, over 3 to 5 days. The 
inhibitory effect of omeprazole on acid secretion increases with repeated 
once-daily dosing, reaching a plateau after four days. </p>
<p>Results from numerous studies of the antisecretory effect of multiple doses 
of 20 mg and 40 mg of omeprazole in normal volunteers and patients are shown 
below. The â€œmaxâ€? value represents determinations at a time of maximum effect 
(2-6 hours after dosing), while â€œminâ€? values are those 24 hours after the last 
dose of omeprazole.</p>
<p>Single daily oral doses of omeprazole ranging from a dose of 10 mg to 40 mg 
have produced 100% inhibition of 24-hour intragastric acidity in some 
patients.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Serum Gastric Effects</span></p>
<p>In studies involving more than 200 patients, serum gastrin levels increased 
during the first 1 to 2 weeks of once-daily administration of therapeutic doses 
of omeprazole in parallel with inhibition of acid secretion. No further increase 
in serum gastrin occurred with continued treatment. In comparison with histamine 
H<span class="Sub">2</span>-receptor antagonists, the median increases produced by 
20 mg doses of omeprazole were higher (1.3 to 3.6 fold vs. 1.1 to 1.8 fold 
increase). Gastrin values returned to pretreatment levels, usually within 1 to 2 
weeks after discontinuation of therapy.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) Cell Effects</span></p>
<p>Human gastric biopsy specimens have been obtained from more than 3000 
patients treated with omeprazole in long-term clinical trials. The incidence of 
ECL cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4296894" conceptname="Hyperplasia">hyperplasia</span> in these studies increased with time; however, no case of 
ECL cell carcinoids, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4093447" conceptname="Dysplasia">dysplasia</span>, or neoplasia has been found in these patients. 
[<span class="Italics">See <a href="#section-">   Clinical 
Pharmacology</a> (12</span> ] However, these studies are of insufficient 
duration and size to rule out the possible influence of long-term administration 
of omeprazole on the development of any premalignant or malignant conditions. 
</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Other Effects</span></p>
<p>Systemic effects of omeprazole in the CNS, cardiovascular and respiratory 
systems have not been found to date. Omeprazole, given in oral doses of 30 or 40 
mg for 2 to 4 weeks, had no effect on thyroid function, carbohydrate metabolism, 
or circulating levels of parathyroid hormone, cortisol, estradiol, testosterone, 
prolactin, cholecystokinin or secretin. </p>
<p>No effect on gastric emptying of the solid and liquid components of a test 
meal was demonstrated after a single dose of omeprazole 90 mg. In healthy 
subjects, a single I.V. dose of omeprazole (0.35 mg/kg) had no effect on 
intrinsic factor secretion. No systematic dose-dependent effect has been 
observed on basal or stimulated pepsin output in humans. </p>
<p>However, when intragastric pH is maintained at 4.0 or above, basal pepsin 
output is low, and pepsin activity is decreased. </p>
<p>As do other agents that elevate intragastric pH, omeprazole administered for 
14 days in healthy subjects produced a significant increase in the intragastric 
concentrations of viable bacteria. The pattern of the bacterial species was 
unchanged from that commonly found in saliva. All changes resolved within three 
days of stopping treatment. </p>
<p>The course of Barrettâ€™s esophagus in 106 patients was evaluated in a U.S. 
double-blind controlled study of PRILOSEC 40 mg twice daily for 12 months 
followed by 20 mg twice daily for 12 months or ranitidine 300 mg twice daily for 
24 months. No clinically significant impact on Barrettâ€™s mucosa by antisecretory 
therapy was observed. Although neosquamous epithelium developed during 
antisecretory therapy, complete elimination of Barrettâ€™s mucosa was not 
achieved. No significant difference was observed between treatment groups in 
development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4093447" conceptname="Dysplasia">dysplasia</span> in Barrettâ€™s mucosa and no patient developed esophageal 
carcinoma during treatment. No significant differences between treatment groups

<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a>12.3 Pharmacokinetics<p><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></p>
<p>PRILOSEC Delayed-Release Capsules contain an enteric-coated granule 
formulation of omeprazole (because omeprazole is acid-labile), so that 
absorption of omeprazole begins only after the granules leave the stomach. 
Absorption is rapid, with peak plasma levels of omeprazole occurring within 0.5 
to 3.5 hours. Peak plasma concentrations of omeprazole and AUC are approximately 
proportional to doses up to 40 mg, but because of a saturable first-pass effect, 
a greater than linear response in peak plasma concentration and AUC occurs with 
doses greater than 40 mg. Absolute bioavailability (compared with intravenous 
administration) is about 30-40% at doses of 20-40 mg, due in large part to 
presystemic metabolism. In healthy subjects the plasma half-life is 0.5 to 1 
hour, and the total body clearance is 500-600 mL/min.</p>
<p>Based on a relative bioavailability study, the AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of PRILOSEC (omeprazole magnesium) for Delayed-Release Oral 
Suspension were 87% and 88% of those for PRILOSEC Delayed-Release Capsules, 
respectively. </p>
<p>The bioavailability of omeprazole increases slightly upon repeated 
administration of PRILOSEC Delayed-Release Capsules. </p>
<p>PRILOSEC Delayed-Release Capsule 40 mg was bioequivalent when administered 
with and without applesauce. However, PRILOSEC Delayed-Release Capsule 20 mg was 
not bioequivalent when administered with and without applesauce. When 
administered with applesauce, a mean 25% reduction in C<span class="Sub">max</span> was observed without a significant change in AUC for 
PRILOSEC Delayed-Release Capsule 20 mg. The clinical relevance of this finding 
is unknown. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></p>
<p>Protein binding is approximately 95%. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p>
<p>Omeprazole is extensively metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme 
system. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p>
<p>Following single dose oral administration of a buffered solution of 
omeprazole, little if any unchanged drug was excreted in urine. The majority of 
the dose (about 77%) was eliminated in urine as at least six metabolites. Two 
were identified as hydroxyomeprazole and the corresponding carboxylic acid. The 
remainder of the dose was recoverable in feces. This implies a significant 
biliary excretion of the metabolites of omeprazole. Three metabolites have been 
identified in plasma â€” the sulfide and sulfone derivatives of omeprazole, and 
hydroxyomeprazole. These metabolites have very little or no antisecretory 
activity. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials</span></p>
<p>Omeprazole 40 mg daily was given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg 
every 8 hours to healthy adult male subjects. The steady state plasma 
concentrations of omeprazole were increased (C<span class="Sub">max</span>, 
AUC<span class="Sub">0-24</span>, and T<span class="Sub">1/2</span> increases of 
30%, 89% and 34% respectively) by the concomitant administration of 
clarithromycin. The observed increases in omeprazole plasma concentration were 
associated with the following pharmacological effects. The mean 24-hour gastric 
pH value was 5.2 when omeprazole was administered alone and 5.7 when 
co-administered with clarithromycin.</p>
<p>The plasma levels of clarithromycin and 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin were 
increased by the concomitant administration of omeprazole. For clarithromycin, 
the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> was 10% greater, the mean C<span class="Sub">min</span> was 27% greater, and the mean AUC<span class="Sub">0-8</span> 
was 15% greater when clarithromycin was administered with omeprazole than when 
clarithromycin was administered alone. Similar results were seen for 
14-hydroxy-clarithromycin, the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> was 45% greater, 
the mean C<span class="Sub">min</span> was 57% greater, and the mean AUC<span class="Sub">0-8</span> was 45% greater. Clarithromycin concentrations in the 
gastric tissue and mucus were also increased by concomitant administration of 
omeprazole.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Special Populations</span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Geriatric Population</span></p>
<p>The elimination rate of omeprazole was somewhat decreased in the elderly, and 
bioavailability was increased. Omeprazole was 76% bioavailable when a single 40 
mg oral dose of omeprazole (buffered solution) was administered to healthy 
elderly volunteers, versus 58% in young volunteers given the same dose. Nearly 
70% of the dose was recovered in urine as metabolites of omeprazole and no 
unchanged drug was detected. The plasma clearance of omeprazole was 250 mL/min 
(about half that of young volunteers) and its plasma half-life averaged one 
hour, about twice that of young healthy volunteers.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Pediatric Use</span></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of omeprazole have been investigated in pediatric 
patients 2 to 16 years of age:</p>
<p>Following comparable mg/kg doses of omeprazole, younger children (2 to 5 
years of age) have lower AUCs than children 6 to16 years of age or adults; AUCs 
of the latter two groups did not differ. [<span class="Italics">See <a href="#section-"> Dosage and Administration</a> (2)</span> ]</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic Impairment</span> </span></p>
<p>In patients with chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span>, the bioavailability increased to 
approximately 100% compared with an I.V. dose, reflecting decreased first-pass 
effect, and the plasma half-life of the drug increased to nearly 3 hours 
compared with the half-life in normals of 0.5-1 hour. Plasma clearance averaged 
70 mL/min, compared with a value of 500-600 mL/min in normal subjects. Dose 
reduction, particularly where maintenance of healing of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4024833" conceptname="Esophageal erosions">erosive esophagitis</span> is 
indicated, for the hepatically impaired should be considered. </p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal Impairment</span></span></p>
<p>In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196991" conceptname="Chronic renal impairment">chronic renal impairment</span>, whose creatinine clearance ranged 
between 10 and 62 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>, the disposition of 
omeprazole was very similar to that in healthy volunteers, although there was a 
slight increase in bioavailability. Because urinary excretion is a primary route 
of excretion of omeprazole metabolites, their elimination slowed in proportion 
to the decreased creatinine clearance. No dose reduction is necessary in 
patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Asian Population</span></p>
<p>In pharmacokinetic studies of single 20 mg omeprazole doses, an increase in 
AUC of approximately four-fold was noted in Asian subjects compared with 
Caucasians. Dose reduction, particularly where maintenance of healing of erosive 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="30753" conceptname="Esophagitis">esophagitis</span> is indicated, for Asian subjects should be considered.</p>

Monotherapy<p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying 
conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug 
cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and 
may not reflect the rates observed in practice. </p>
<p>The safety data described below reflects exposure to PRILOSEC Delayed-Release 
Capsules in 3096 patients from worldwide clinical trials (465 patients from US 
studies and 2,631 patients from international studies). Indications clinically 
studied in US trials included <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4057053" conceptname="Acute duodenal ulcer">duodenal ulcer</span>, resistant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcer</span>, and 
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The international clinical trials were double blind 
and open-label in design. The most common adverse reactions reported (i.e., with 
an incidence rate greater or equal to 2%) from PRILOSEC-treated patients enrolled in these studies 
included <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> (6.9%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal pain</span> (5.2%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> (4.0%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span> (3.7%),

<p>The clinical trial safety profile in patients greater than 65 years of age 
was similar to that in patients 65 years of age or less. </p>
<p>The clinical trial safety profile in pediatric patients who received PRILOSEC 
Delayed-Release Capsules was similar to that in adult patients. Unique to the 
pediatric population, however, adverse reactions of the respiratory system were 
most frequently reported in both the 1 to greater than 2 and 2 to 16 year age groups 
(75.0% and 18.5%, respectively). Similarly, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span> was frequently reported in the 
1 to 2 year age group (33.0%) and accidental injuries were reported frequently

Combination Therapy for <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span> Eradication<p>In clinical trials using either dual therapy with PRILOSEC and 
clarithromycin, or triple therapy with PRILOSEC, clarithromycin, and

observed. Adverse reactions observed were limited to those previously reported 
with omeprazole, clarithromycin, or amoxicillin alone. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Dual Therapy (PRILOSEC/clarithromycin) </span></p>
<p>Adverse reactions observed in controlled clinical trials using combination

previous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span> to penicillins, cephalosporins or other 
allergens. If an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergic reaction</span> occurs, amoxicillin should be discontinued 
and appropriate therapy instituted. Serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylactic reactions</span> require

potential hazard to the fetus. (See Warnings in prescribing information for 
clarithromycin.) </p>
<p>Co-administration of omeprazole and clarithromycin has resulted in increases 
in plasma levels of omeprazole, clarithromycin, and 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin.

<a href="http://"></a>10 OVERDOSAGE<p class="First">Reports have been received of overdosage with omeprazole in 
humans. Doses ranged up to 2400 mg (120 times the usual recommended clinical

were transient, and no serious clinical outcome has been reported when PRILOSEC 
was taken alone. No specific antidote for omeprazole overdosage is known. 
Omeprazole is extensively protein bound and is, therefore, not readily 
dialyzable. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and 
supportive. </p>
<p>As with the management of any <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, the possibility of multiple drug 
ingestion should be considered. For current information on treatment of any drug
