<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Bumetanide is a loop diuretic, available as scored tablets, 0.5 mg (light green), 1 mg (yellow) and 2 mg (peach) for oral administration; each tablet also contains: anhydrous lactose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, corn starch and talc, with the following colorants: 0.5 mg (D&amp;C Yellow No. 10 Aluminum Lake and FD&amp;C Blue No. 1 Aluminum Lake); 1 mg (D&amp;C Yellow No. 10 Aluminum Lake); 2 mg (Ferric oxide red).</p>
<p>Chemically, bumetanide is 3-(butylamino)-4-phenoxy-5-sulfamoyl-benzoic acid. It is a practically white powder. It is slightly soluble in water and soluble in alkaline solutions. It has the following structural formula:</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Bumetanide is a loop diuretic with a rapid onset and short duration of action. Pharmacological and clinical studies have shown that 1 mg bumetanide has a diuretic potency equivalent to approximately 40 mg furosemide. The major site of bumetanide action is the ascending limb of the loop of Henle. The mode of action has been determined through various clearance studies in both humans and experimental animals. Bumetanide inhibits sodium reabsorption in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, as shown by marked reduction of free-water clearance (<span class="Sup">C</span>H<span class="Sub">2</span>O) during hydration and tubular free-water reabsorption (T<span class="Sup">C</span>H<span class="Sub">2</span>O) during hydropenia. Reabsorption of chloride in the ascending limb is also blocked by bumetanide, and bumetanide is somewhat more chloruretic than natriuretic.</p>
<p>Potassium excretion is also increased by bumetanide, in a dose-related fashion.</p>
<p>Bumetanide may have an additional action in the proximal tubule. Since phosphate reabsorption takes place largely in the proximal tubule, phosphaturia during bumetanide-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span> is indicative of this additional action. This is further supported by the reduction in the renal clearance of bumetanide by probenecid, associated with diminution in the natriuretic response. This proximal tubular activity does not seem to be related to an inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. Bumetanide does not appear to have a noticeable action on the distal tubule.</p>
<p>Bumetanide decreases uric acid excretion and increases serum uric acid. Following oral administration of bumetanide the onset of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span> occurs in 30 to 60 minutes. Peak activity is reached between 1 and 2 hours. At usual doses (1 to 2 mg) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span> is largely complete within 4 hours; with higher doses, the diuretic action lasts for 4 to 6 hours. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">Diuresis</span> starts within minutes following an intravenous injection and reaches maximum levels within 15 to 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Several pharmacokinetic studies have shown that bumetanide, administered orally or parenterally, is eliminated rapidly in humans, with a half-life of between 1 and 1 1/2 hours. Plasma protein-binding is in the range of 94% to 96%.</p>
<p>Oral administration of carbon-14 labeled bumetanide to human volunteers revealed that 81% of the administered radioactivity was excreted in the urine, 45% of it as unchanged drug. Urinary and biliary metabolites identified in this study were formed by oxidation of the N-butyl side chain. Biliary excretion of bumetanide amounted to only 2% of the administered dose.</p>

<h2>Pediatric Pharmacology</h2>
<p class="First">Elimination of bumetanide appears to be considerably slower in neonatal patients compared with adults, possibly because of immature renal and hepatobiliary function in this population. Small pharmacokinetic studies of intravenous bumetanide in preterm and full term neonates with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320136" conceptname="Disorder of respiratory system">respiratory disorders</span> have reported an apparent half-life of approximately 6 hours with a range up to 15 hours and a serum clearance ranging from 0.2 to 1.1 mL/min/kg. In a population of neonates receiving bumetanide for volume overload, mean serum clearance rates were 2.17 mL/min/kg in patients less than 2 months of age and 3.8 mL/min/kg in patients aged 2 to 6 months. Mean serum half-life of bumetanide was 2.5 hours and 1.5 hours in patients aged less than 2 months and those aged 2 to 6 months, respectively. Elimination half-life decreased considerably during the first month of life, from a mean of approximately 6 hours at birth to approximately 2.4 hours at 1 month of age.</p>
<p>In preterm neonates, mean serum concentrations following a single 0.05 mg/kg dose ranged from 126 mcg/L at 1 hour to 57 mcg/L at 8 hours. In another study, mean serum concentrations following a single 0.05 mg/kg dose were 338 ng/mL at 30 minutes and 176 ng/mL after 4 hours.</p>
<p>A single dose of 0.1 mg/kg produced mean serum levels of 314 ng/mL at 1 hour, and 195 ng/mL at 6 hours. Mean volume of distribution in neonates and infants has been reported to range from 0.26 L/kg to 0.39 L/kg.</p>
<p>The degree of protein binding of bumetanide in cord sera from healthy neonates was approximately 97%, suggesting the potential for bilirubin displacement. A study using pooled sera from critically ill neonates found that bumetanide at concentrations of 0.5 to 50 mcg/mL, but not 0.25 mcg/mL, caused a linear increase in unbound bilirubin concentrations.</p>
<p>In 56 infants aged 4 days to 6 months, bumetanide doses ranging from 0.005 mg/kg to 0.1 mg/kg were studied for pharmacodynamic effect. Peak bumetanide excretion rates increased linearly with increasing doses of drug. Maximal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuretic effect</span> was observed at a bumetanide excretion rate of about 7 mcg/kg/hr, corresponding to doses of 0.035 to 0.040 mg/kg. Higher doses produced a higher bumetanide excretion rate but no increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuretic effect</span>. Urine flow rate peaked during the first hour after drug administration in 80% of patients and by 3 hours in all patients.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Pharmacology</h2>
<p class="First">In a group of ten geriatric subjects between the ages of 65 and 73 years, total bumetanide clearance was significantly lower (1.8 Â± 0.3 mL/minâ€¢kg) compared with younger subjects (2.9 Â± 0.2 mL/minâ€¢kg) after a single oral bumetanide 0.5 mg dose. Maximum plasma concentrations were higher in geriatric subjects (16.9 Â± 1.8 ng/mL) compared with younger subÂ­jects (10.3 Â± 1.5 ng/mL). Urine flow rate and total excretion of sodium and potassium were increased less in the geriatric subjects compared with younger subjects, although potassium excretion and fractional sodium excretion were similar between the two age groups. Nonrenal clearance, bioavailability, and volume of distribution were not significantly different between the two groups.</p>

In these test animals bumetanide was 5 to 6 times more potent than furosemide and, since the diuretic potency of bumetanide is about 40 to 60 times furosemide, it is anticipated that blood levels necessary to produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4236623" conceptname="Ototoxicity">ototoxicity</span> will rarely be achieved. The potential exists, however, and must be considered a risk of intravenous therapy, especially at high doses, repeated frequently in the face of renal excretory function impairment.

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Drugs With Ototoxic Potential (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>) </p>
<p>Especially in the presence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>, the use of parenterally administered bumetanide in patients to whom aminoglycoside antibiotics are also being given should be avoided, except in life-threatening conditions.</p>
<p>Drugs With Nephrotoxic Potential </p>
<p>There has been no experience with the concurrent use of bumetanide with drugs known to have a nephrotoxic potential. Therefore, the simultaneous administration of these drugs should be avoided.</p>
<p>Lithium </p>
<p>Lithium should generally not be given with diuretics (such as bumetanide) because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium toxicity</span>.</p>
<p>Probenecid </p>
<p>Pretreatment with probenecid reduces both the natriuresis and hyperreninemia produced by bumetanide. This antagonistic effect of probenecid on bumetanide natriuresis is not due to a direct action on sodium excretion but is probably secondary to its inhibitory effect on renal tubular secretion of bumetanide. Thus, probenecid should not be administered concurrently with bumetanide.</p>
<p>Indomethacin </p>
<p>Indomethacin blunts the increases in urine volume and sodium excretion seen during bumetanide treatment and inhibits the bumetanide-induced increase in plasma renin activity. Concurrent therapy with bumetanide is thus not recommended.</p>
<p>Antihypertensives </p>
<p>Bumetanide may potentiate the effect of various antihypertensive drugs, necessitating a reduction in the dosage of these drugs.</p>
<p>Digoxin </p>
<p>Interaction studies in humans have shown no effect on digoxin blood levels.</p>
<p>Anticoagulants </p>
<p>Interaction studies in humans have shown bumetanide to have no effect on warfarin metabolism or on plasma <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> activity.</p>

A repeat study at the same doses failed to duplicate this finding. Reproduction studies were performed to evaluate general reproductive performance and fertility in rats at oral dose levels of 10, 30, 60 or 100 mg/kg/day. The pregnancy rate was slightly decreased in the treated animals; however, the differences were small and not statistically significant.</p>

These effects were associated with maternal weight reductions noted during dosing. No such adverse effects were observed at 30 mg/kg/day (1000 times the maximum human therapeutic dose). No fetotoxicity was observed at 1000 to 2000 times the human therapeutic dose.</p>
<p>In rabbits, a dose-related decrease in litter size and an increase in resorption rate were noted at oral doses of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg/day (3.4 and 10 times the maximum human therapeutic dose). A slightly increased incidence of delayed ossification of sternebrae occurred at 0.3 mg/kg/day; however, no such adverse effects were observed at the dose of 0.03 mg/kg/day. The sensitivity of the rabbit to bumetanide parallels the marked pharmacologic and toxicologic effects of the drug in this species.</p>
<p>Bumetanide was not teratogenic in the hamster at an oral dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day (17 times the maximum human therapeutic dose). Bumetanide was not teratogenic when given intravenously to mice and rats at doses up to 140 times the maximum human therapeutic dose.</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. A small investigational experience in the United States and marketing experience in other countries to date have not indicated any evidence of adverse effects on the fetus, but these data do not rule out the possibility of harmful effects. Bumetanide should be given to a pregnant woman only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while the patient is on bumetanide since it may be excreted in human milk.</p>

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 18 have not been established.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies using pooled sera from critically ill neonates have shown bumetanide to be a potent displacer of bilirubin (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>,Â  <span class="Bold">Pediatric Pharmacology</span>).

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of bumetanide did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>
<p>This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p>

<h2>Oral Administration</h2>
<p class="First">The usual total daily dosage of bumetanide is 0.5 to 2 mg and in most patients is given as a single dose.</p>
<p>If the diuretic response to an initial dose of bumetanide is not adequate, in view of its rapid onset and short duration of action, a second or third dose may be given at 4- to 5-hour intervals up to a maximum daily dose of 10 mg. An intermittent dose schedule, whereby bumetanide is given on alternate days or for 3 to 4 days with rest periods of 1 to 2 days in between, is recommended as the safest and most effective method for the continued control of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span>. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic failure</span>, the dosage should be kept to a minimum, and if necessary, dosage increased very carefully. Because cross-sensitivity with furosemide has rarely been observed, bumetanide can be substituted at approximately a 1:40 ratio of bumetanide to furosemide in patients allergic to furosemide.</p>
