<h4><span class="Italics">Oral Bioavailability</span></h4>
<p class="First">Following oral administration, cefditoren pivoxil is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and hydrolyzed to cefditoren by esterases. Maximal plasma concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of cefditoren under fasting conditions average 1.8 Â± 0.6 Âµg/mL following a single 200 mg dose and occur 1.5 to 3 hours following dosing.</p>
<p>Less than dose-proportional increases in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) were observed at doses of 400 mg and above. Cefditoren does not accumulate in plasma following twice daily administration to subjects with normal renal function. Under fasting conditions, the estimated absolute bioavailability of cefditoren pivoxil is approximately 14%. The absolute bioavailability of cefditoren pivoxil administered with a low fat meal (693 cal, 14 g fat, 122 g carb, 23 g protein) is 16.1 Â± 3.0%.</p>

<h4><span class="Italics">Food Effect</span></h4>
<p class="First">Administration of cefditoren pivoxil following a high fat meal (858 cal, 64 g fat, 43 g carb, 31 g protein) resulted in a 70% increase in mean AUC and a 50% increase in mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> compared to administration of cefditoren pivoxil in the fasted state. After a high fat meal, the C<span class="Sub">max </span>averaged 3.1 Â± 1.0 Âµg/mL following a single 200 mg dose of cefditoren pivoxil and 4.4 Â± 0.9 Âµg/mL following a 400 mg dose. Cefditoren AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> values from studies conducted with a moderate fat meal (648 cal, 27 g fat, 73 g carb, 29 g protein) are similar to those obtained following a high fat meal.</p>

<h3>Distribution</h3>
<p class="First">The mean volume of distribution at steady state (V<span class="Sub">ss</span>) of cefditoren is 9.3 Â± 1.6 L. Binding of cefditoren to plasma proteins averages 88% from <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>determinations, and is concentration-independent at cefditoren concentrations ranging from 0.05 to10 Âµg/mL. Cefditoren is primarily bound to human serum albumin and its binding is decreased when serum albumin concentrations are reduced. Binding to Î±-1-acid glycoprotein ranges from 3.3 to 8.1%. Penetration into red blood cells is negligible.</p>

<h3>Metabolism and Excretion</h3>
<p class="First">Cefditoren is eliminated from the plasma, with a mean terminal elimination half-life (t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>) of 1.6 Â± 0.4 hours in young healthy adults. Cefditoren is not appreciably metabolized.  After absorption, cefditoren is mainly eliminated by excretion into the urine, with a renal clearance of approximately 4-5 L/h. Studies with the renal tubular transport blocking agent probenecid indicate that tubular secretion, along with glomerular filtration is involved in the renal elimination of cefditoren. Cefditoren renal clearance is reduced in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>. (See Special Populations, <span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span> </span>and <span class="Italics">Hemodialysis.)</span></p>
<p>Hydrolysis of cefditoren pivoxil to its active component, cefditoren, results in the formation of pivalate. Following multiple doses of cefditoren pivoxil, greater than 70% of the pivalate is absorbed. Pivalate is mainly eliminated (&gt;99%) through renal excretion, nearly exclusively as pivaloylcarnitine. Following a 200 mg BID regimen for 10 days, the mean decrease in plasma concentrations of total carnitine was 18.1 Â± 7.2 nmole/mL, representing a 39% decrease in plasma carnitine concentrations. Following a 400 mg BID regimen for 14 days, the mean decrease in plasma concentrations of carnitine was 33.3 Â± 9.7 nmole/mL, representing a 63% decrease in plasma carnitine concentrations. Plasma concentrations of carnitine returned to the normal control range within 7 to 10 days after discontinuation of cefditoren pivoxil.

<h4><span class="Italics">Geriatric</span></h4>
<p class="First">The effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of cefditoren was evaluated in 48 male and female subjects aged 25 to 75 years given 400 mg cefditoren pivoxil BID for 7 days. Physiological changes related to increasing age increased the extent of cefditoren exposure in plasma, as evidenced by a 26% higher C<span class="Sub">max</span> and a 33% higher AUC for subjects aged â‰¥ 65 years compared with younger subjects. The rate of elimination of cefditoren from plasma was lower in subjects aged â‰¥ 65 years, with t<span class="Sub">1/2 </span>values 16-26% longer than for younger subjects. Renal clearance of cefditoren in subjects aged â‰¥ 65 years was 20-24% lower than in younger subjects. These changes could be attributed to age-related changes in creatinine clearance. No dose adjustments are necessary for elderly patients with normal (for their age) renal function.</p>

<h4><span class="Italics">Gender</span></h4>
<p class="First">The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of cefditoren was evaluated in 24 male and 24 female subjects given 400 mg cefditoren pivoxil BID for 7 days. The extent of exposure in plasma was greater in females than in males, as evidenced by a 14% higher C<span class="Sub">max</span> and a 16% higher AUC for females compared to males. Renal clearance of cefditoren in females was 13% lower than in males.

<p>A report of â€œSusceptibleâ€? indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentration usually achievable. A report of â€œIntermediateâ€? indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone that prevents small, uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of â€œResistantâ€? indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentration usually achievable and that other therapy should be selected.</p>

In community-acquired <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255848" conceptname="Pneumonia">pneumonia</span> patients (N=192, mean age 51.3 Â± 17.8 years) given a 400 mg BID regimen for 14 days, the mean decrease in serum concentrations of total carnitine while on therapy was 21.5 Â± 13.1 mole/mL, representing a 46% decrease in serum carnitine concentrations. Plasma concentrations of carnitine returned to the normal control range within 7 days after discontinuation of cefditoren pivoxil. Comparable decreases in carnitine were observed in healthy volunteers (mean age 33.6 Â± 7.4 years) following a 200 mg or 400 mg BID regimen. (See <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>.) Community-acquired <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255848" conceptname="Pneumonia">pneumonia</span> clinical trials demonstrated no adverse events attributable to decreases in serum carnitine concentrations.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Information for Patients</span></h2>
<p class="First">Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including SPECTRACEFÂ® should only be used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432545" conceptname="Bacterial infectious disease">bacterial infections</span>. They do not treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440029" conceptname="Viral disease">viral infections</span> (e.g., the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">common cold</span>). When SPECTRACEFÂ® is prescribed to treat a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432545" conceptname="Bacterial infectious disease">bacterial infection</span>, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by SPECTRACEFÂ® or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p>
<p>SPECTRACEFÂ® (cefditoren pivoxil) should be taken with meals to enhance absorption.</p>
<p>SPECTRACEFÂ® may be taken concomitantly with oral contraceptives.</p>
<p>It is not recommended that SPECTRACEFÂ® be taken concomitantly with antacids or other drugs taken to reduce stomach acids. (See <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions.</span>)</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</span></h2>
<p class="First">No long-term animal carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with cefditoren pivoxil. Cefditoren pivoxil was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial reverse mutation assay, or in the mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> mutation assay at the hypoxanthineguanine phosphoribosyltransferase locus. In Chinese hamster lung cells, chromosomal aberrations were produced by cefditoren pivoxil, but not by cefditoren. Subsequent studies showed that the chromosome aberrations were due to the release of formaldehyde from the pivoxil ester moiety in the <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>assay system. Neither cefditoren nor cefditoren pivoxil produced chromosomal aberrations when tested in an <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>human peripheral blood lymphocyte assay, or in the <span class="Italics">in vivo </span>mouse micronucleus assay. Cefditoren pivoxil did not induce unscheduled DNA syntheses when tested.

<h3>Pregnancy Category B</h3>
<p class="First">Cefditoren pivoxil was not teratogenic up to the highest doses tested in rats and rabbits. In rats, this dose was 1000 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 24 times a human dose of 200 mg BID based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day. In rabbits, the highest dose tested was 90 mg/kg/day, which is approximately four times a human dose of 200 mg BID based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day. This dose produced severe maternal toxicity and resulted in fetal toxicity and abortions.</p>
<p>In a postnatal development study in rats, cefditoren pivoxil produced no adverse effects on postnatal survival, physical and behavioral development, learning abilities, and reproductive capability at sexual maturity when tested at doses of up to 750 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested. This is approximately 18 times a human dose of 200 mg BID based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day. </p>
<p>There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p>

<p class="First">Of the 2675 patients in clinical studies who received cefditoren pivoxil 200 mg BID, 308 (12%) were &gt;65 years of age. Of the 2159 patients in clinical studies who received cefditoren pivoxil 400 mg BID, 307 (14%) were &gt;65 years of age. No clinically significant differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between older and younger patients. No dose adjustments are necessary in geriatric patients with normal (for their age) renal function.

<h1><span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span></h1>
<p class="First">Information on cefditoren pivoxil overdosage in humans is not available.

Hemodialysis may aid in the removal of cefditoren from the body, particularly if renal function is compromised (30% reduction of plasma concentrations following 4 hours of hemodialysis). Treat overdosage symptomatically and institute supportive measures as required.</p>
<p>In acute animal toxicity studies, cefditoren pivoxil when tested at the limit oral doses of 5100 mg/kg in rats and up to 2000 mg/kg in dogs did not exhibit any health effects of concern. Certain effects, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span> and soft stool lasting for a few days were observed in some animals as expected with most oral antibiotics due to inhibition of intestinal microflora.</p>
