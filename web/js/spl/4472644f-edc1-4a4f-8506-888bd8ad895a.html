<h2>Dogs</h2>
<p class="First">The initial recommended vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> dose is 0.5 IU insulin/kg body weight. Initially, this dose should be given once daily concurrently with, or right after a meal.</p>
<p>Twice daily therapy should be initiated if the duration of insulin action is determined to be inadequate. If twice daily treatment is initiated, the two doses should each be 25% less than the once daily dose required to attain an acceptable nadir. For example, if a dog receiving 20 units of vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> once daily has an acceptable nadir but inadequate duration of activity, the vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> dose should be changed to 15 units twice daily.</p>
<p>The veterinarian should re-evaluate the dog at appropriate intervals and adjust the dose based on clinical signs, urinalysis results, and glucose curve values until adequate glycemic control has been attained. Further adjustments in dosage may be necessary with changes in the dog's diet, body weight, or concomitant medication, or if the dog develops concurrent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span>, neoplasia, or an additional endocrine or other medical disorder.</p>

<h2>Cats</h2>
<p class="First">The initial recommended dose in cats is 1 to 2 IU per injection. The injections should be given twice daily at approximately 12 hour intervals. For cats fed twice daily, the injections should be given concurrently with, or right after each meal. For cats fed <span class="Italics">ad libitum</span>, no change in feeding schedule is needed.</p>
<p>The veterinarian should re-evaluate the cat at appropriate intervals and adjust the dose based on clinical signs, urinalysis results, and glucose curve values until adequate glycemic control has been attained.

<h2>Dogs</h2>
<p class="First">In the field effectiveness and safety study, 66 dogs were treated with vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span>. Sixty-two dogs were included in the assessment of safety. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">Hypoglycemia</span> (defined as blood glucose &lt; 50 mg/dL) with or without associated clinical signs occurred in 35.5% (22/62) of the dogs at various times during the study. Clinical signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> were generally mild in nature (described as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">weakness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4061577" conceptname="Lethargy">lethargy</span>, stumbling, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falling down</span>, and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>). <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4011527" conceptname="Spatial disorientation">Disorientation</span> and collapse were reported less frequently and occurred in 16.1% (10/62) of the dogs. Two dogs had a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> and one dog died during the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span>. Although never confirmed, the presumptive diagnosis was <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>. In the rest of the dogs, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> resolved with appropriate therapy and adjustments in insulin dosage. Seven owners recorded the following observations about the injection site on the home monitoring forms: swollen, painful, sore, and a bleb under the skin.</p>
<p>The following clinical observations occurred in the field study following treatment with vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> and may be directly attributed to the drug or may be secondary to the diabetic state or other underlying conditions in the dogs: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75004" conceptname="Frank hematuria">hematuria</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192640" conceptname="Pancreatitis">pancreatitis</span>, non-specific hepatopathy/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192640" conceptname="Pancreatitis">pancreatitis</span>, development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">cataracts</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="81902" conceptname="Urinary tract infectious disease">urinary tract infections</span>.</p>
<p>In a 21-day field safety and effectiveness study, 40 dogs, already well controlled on vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span>, were administered vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> using a VetPen™ insulin pen loaded with a pre-filled 2.7 mL vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> cartridge and 29 gauge/12 mm pen needles. All dogs enrolled in the study were evaluated for safety. Loss of diabetic control was reported in 10 dogs, 3 of which were withdrawn from the study. Four dogs' loss of control resolved after dose adjustment while still using the insulin pen. For the remaining 3 dogs, the loss of diabetic control was reported at the end of the study and outcome was not documented.

<h1>GENERAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> is a mixture of amorphous and crystalline insulin resulting in immediate and prolonged insulin activity. In dogs, vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> may show two peaks of activity. In a laboratory study, 12 healthy adult Beagles were administered vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> at a dose of 0.5 IU/kg. The onset of activity varied from 0.5 to 2 hours; the time to peak activity varied from 1 to 10 hours; and the duration of activity varied from 10 to 24 hours. In diabetic dogs, vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> has two peaks of activity following subcutaneous administration (the first occurs at 2 to 6 hours and the second at 8 to 14 hours). The duration of activity varies between 14 and 24 hours.</p>
<p>In cats, vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> has a single peak of activity. In a laboratory study, 12 healthy adult cats were administered vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> at a dose of 0.5 IU/kg. The onset of activity varied from 0.5 to 2 hours; the time to peak activity varied from 2 to 6 hours; and the duration of activity varied from 8 to 24 hours. In diabetic cats, the peak activity following subcutaneous administration of vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> occurs between 1.5 and 8 hours, and the duration of activity varies between 8 and 12 hours.</p>
<p>The peak(s) of activity, duration of activity, and dose required to adequately control diabetic signs vary between individuals and may vary in the same individual from day to day. The time ranges should only be considered as initial guidelines.</p>

<p>Dogs were started on vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> at a dose of 1 IU/kg plus a body weight-dependent dose supplement once daily. The initial treatment time to reach acceptable glycemic control (Dose determination period) ranged from 5 to 151 days. Dogs were evaluated for treatment effectiveness three times at 30-day intervals (Study Period). The blood glucose curve means and mean nadirs were compared pre- and post-treatment to assess effectiveness. Glycemic control was considered adequate if an acceptable blood glucose curve was achieved (reduction in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span> and a nadir of 60 - 160 mg/dL), clinical signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">polyuria</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432454" conceptname="Excessive thirst">polydipsia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171926" conceptname="Ketonuria">ketonuria</span>) were improved, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> (blood glucose &lt; 50 mg/dL) was avoided. The blood glucose curve mean was reduced from 370 mg/dL pre-treatment to 151 mg/dL, 185 mg/dL, and 184 mg/dL at the three treatment period evaluations. The blood glucose mean nadir was reduced from 315 mg/dL pre-treatment to 93 mg/dL, 120 mg/dL, and 119 mg/dL at the three treatment period evaluations. Sixty days after an adequate vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> dose was initially established, 94%, 96% and 83% of study dogs experienced a reduction in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">polyuria</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432454" conceptname="Excessive thirst">polydipsia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171926" conceptname="Ketonuria">ketonuria</span>, respectively. Investigators reported adequate glycemic control an average of 81% of the time during the Study Period.</p>
<p>In a 21-day field safety and effectiveness study, 40 dogs, already well controlled on vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span>, were administered vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> using a VetPen™ insulin pen loaded with a pre-filled 2.7 mL vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> cartridge and 29 gauge/12 mm pen needles. Thirty-eight of 40 dogs were evaluated for effectiveness. Thirty-seven of the 38 owners (97.4 %) said they were able to learn how to use the pen. Thirty-five of the 38 owners (92.1 %) said the pen was well tolerated by the dogs. For 34 of the 38 dogs (89.5%), the investigators said that the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> was not negatively affected by the use of the pen.</p>

<h2>Cats</h2>
<p class="First"> A total of 85 client-owned cats (53 males and 25 females—all neutered) of various breeds were enrolled in a 60 day field effectiveness and safety study with continued use up to Day 180. Seven cats were removed from the study prior to the Day 7 evaluation. The remaining cats ranged in age from 3 to 17.5 years and in weight from 1.9 to 10.8 kg. Seventy-two cats completed the study to Day 60 and 66 cats completed to Day 180. The cats were started on vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> at an initial dose of 1 to 2 IU insulin twice daily. Scheduled evaluations occurred at Days 7, 14, 30, 60, and 180. Dose adjustments were allowed at and between the evaluations. Effectiveness was based on blood glucose curve mean, blood glucose nadir and improvement in clinical signs. Blood glucose curve means decreased from 394 mg/dL on Day 0 to 217 mg/dL on Day 60. The mean blood glucose nadir decreased from 343 mg/dL on Day 0 to 146 mg/dL on Day 60. Fourteen client-owned cats (10 males and 4 females—all neutered) of various breeds were enrolled in a 60 day effectiveness and safety field study. The cats ranged in age from 5 to 14 years and in weight from 3.40 to 6.97 kg. Twelve cats completed the study. The cats were started on vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> at an initial dose of 1 to 2 IU insulin twice daily. Scheduled evaluations occurred at Days 7, 14, 30, and 60. Dose adjustments were allowed at and between the evaluations. The blood glucose curve means decreased from 354 mg/dL on Day 0 to 162 mg/dL on Day 60. The mean blood glucose nadir decreased from 321 mg/dL on Day 0 to 99 mg/dL on Day 60. In a 21-day field safety and effectiveness study, 36 cats, already well controlled on vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span>, were administered vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> using a VetPen™ insulin pen loaded with a pre-filled 2.7 mL vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> cartridge and 29 gauge/12 mm pen needles.

<p><span class="Bold">What is vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span>?</span></p>
<p>vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> is an aqueous suspension of porcine (pork) insulin. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas (a large gland that lies near the stomach). This hormone is necessary for the body's correct use of food, especially sugar.</p>

<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">Diabetes</span> mellitus (DM) occurs when a dog or a cat has inadequate levels of or an abnormal response to insulin. DM is common in middle age and older dogs and cats. Daily insulin injections are usually necessary to treat DM. vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> may help your pet effectively use food, aid in maintaining an acceptable blood sugar (glucose) level, and reduce or eliminate clinical signs commonly seen with DM. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">Diabetes</span> mellitus may cause some or all of these signs or changes:</p>

<p><span class="Bold">How to give vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> to your pet</span></p>
<p>Doses of insulin are measured in units. U-40 insulin contains 40 units/mL (1 mL = 1 cc). vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> is available in vials for use with U-40 syringes or in cartridges for use with the VetPen™ injection device. If you are using vials, refer to the section below. If you are using cartridges, refer to the VetPen™ instructions for use provided with the VetPen™.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Use vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> with U-40 syringes only. </span> Use of a syringe other than a U-40 syringe will result in incorrect dosing. A licensed veterinarian must prescribe vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> for your pet, and it should be administered according to your veterinarian's instructions. Your veterinarian will determine the amount of insulin needed (based on the weight of your pet, clinical signs such as water consumption, and laboratory results), instruct you on proper storage and handling, show you how to draw the insulin from the bottle, and instruct you on how to administer the injection. Once you can do this correctly, your veterinarian will provide you with everything you need to care for your pet at home. vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> should be administered with a U-40 insulin syringe according to the following instructions:</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Preparing the Dose:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands</li>
<li>Remove the vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> bottle from the refrigerator and shake the vial thoroughly until a homogeneous, uniformly milky suspension is obtained. Foam on the surface of the suspension formed during <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">shaking</span> should be allowed to disperse before the product is used and, if required, the product should be gently mixed to maintain a homogeneous, uniformly milky suspension before use. If you see large particles floating in the suspension after thoroughly <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">shaking</span>, do not use the product and contact your veterinarian.</li>
<li>Carefully remove the cap from the needle.</li>
<li>Using a U-40 insulin syringe, pull the plunger back to draw air into the syringe to equal the vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> dose.</li>
<li>Insert the syringe needle into the bottle and inject the air into the bottle.</li>
<li>Turn the bottle and syringe upside down. Making sure the tip of the needle is in the vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span>, withdraw the correct dose into the syringe.</li>
<li>Before removing the needle from the bottle, check the syringe for any air bubbles. If bubbles are present, hold the syringe straight up and tap its side until the bubbles float to the top. Push them out with the plunger and withdraw the correct dose.</li>
<li>Remove the needle from the bottle, being careful to not inject yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Bold">Giving the injection:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Injections should be given just under the skin (subcutaneously) 2-5cm (3/4-2 inches) from the midline of the back (middle of your pet's back running from tail to head), varying from just behind the shoulder blade to slightly in front of the hipbone.</li>
<li>The injection site should be alternated between your pet's left and right side.</li>
<li>Using your free hand, pinch up a fold of skin, insert the needle into the center of the fold as instructed by your veterinarian, and push the plunger in as far as it will go.</li>
<li>Pull the needle out being careful to not inject yourself.</li>
<li>Dispose of the syringe in an appropriate manner (sharps/ biohazard disposal).</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Bold">How do I store vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span>?</span></p>
<p>vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> should be stored in an upright position under refrigeration (2-8 Degrees Celsius / 36-46 Degrees Fahrenheit). Once loaded with a cartridge, the VetPen™ can be stored on its side under refrigeration.</p>
<p>Do not freeze. Protect from light. <span class="Bold">Use contents within 42 days of first vial puncture.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">What else should I know about vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span>?</span></p>
<p>This sheet provides a summary of information about vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span>. If you have any questions or concerns about vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> or DM, talk to your veterinarian.</p>
<p>As with all prescribed medicines, vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> should only be given to the pet for which it was prescribed and for the condition for which it was prescribed.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">Safety Precautions</span></p>
<ul class="Disc">
<li>VetPen™ should be used only after consultation with your veterinarian.</li>
<li>VetPen™ should only be used with vetsulin<span class="Sup">®</span> 2.7 mL cartridges.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Before each use, ensure that VetPen™ has been primed in accordance with the instructions detailed in steps 7 and 8. Failure to follow the exact priming procedures could result in inaccurate dosing of your dog or cat.</span></li>
<li>To avoid potential damage to the VetPen™ , never dial a dose and push the release button without a cartridge in the cartridge holder.</li>
<li>A new needle should be used for each injection.</li>
<li>The needle should be removed with the needle remover and safely disposed of immediately after each injection. If the needle is left on the VetPen™ it may become blocked and affect the dose delivered.</li>
<li>Consult with your veterinarian should you encounter difficulty in injecting your dog or cat or should your dog or cat display any changes in behavior or clinical condition.</li>
<li>The VetPen™ has been tested to perform accurately for 2 years (2 doses/day) to 4 years (1 dose/day) of use.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Bold">Storage and Cleaning</span></p>
<p>VetPen™ should always be stored or carried with the needle removed, and the pen cap on. To clean VetPen™, wipe with a damp cloth. Do not immerse in water.</p>
<p>Once loaded with a cartridge, the VetPen™ should be stored under refrigeration at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F). The loaded VetPen™ can be stored on its side. Do not freeze. Protect from light.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Use contents within 42 days of first puncture.</span></p>

<p><span class="Bold">Priming Advice</span></p>
<p>If the dose selector does not return to the start line, and no insulin has been expelled, this may indicate one of two possibilities:</p>
<ul class="Disc">
<li>The VetPen™ needle that you are using may be blocked. Remove the VetPen™ needle currently attached to the VetPen™ and replace it with a new one. Then return to steps 7 and 8.</li>
<li>The cartridge plunger may require releasing. If so:<ol class="BigAlpha">
<li>Replace the outer protective cap onto the needle.</li>
<li>Unscrew the cartridge holder.</li>
<li>Slide the release button towards the internal plunger and hold in place until the start line on the dose selector returns to the arrow on the pen body.</li>
<li>Dial up 2 units on the dose selector without screwing the internal plunger back together and simply push and hold down the release button towards the internal plunger until the start line on the dose selector returns to the arrow on the pen body.</li>
<li>Without rewinding the internal plunger, screw the cartridge holder and body firmly together. This will release the cartridge plunger and expel some of the insulin. However, the device will <span class="Bold">not</span> be primed.</li>
<li>Holding the device upright, repeat steps 7-8 until the device is fully primed.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Bold">Accessories</span></p>
<p>The following accessories are provided with the VetPen™</p>
<ul class="Disc">
<li>the dose selector adaptor fits onto the dose selector for easier dialing</li>
<li>the release button extension simply clips onto release button for improved grip</li>
<li>the needle remover is used to safely remove the pen needle from the cartridge holder after each injection – refer to step 11 for details</li>
