<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Mean peak plasma levels of approximately 3.5 mcg/mL are reached within 1 to 2 hours, following oral administration of a single 200 mg dose taken with a meal. Subsequent plasma elimination is biphasic with a half-life of 2 hours during the first 10 hours and 8 hours thereafter. Following absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, ketoconazole is converted into several inactive metabolites. The major identified metabolic pathways are oxidation and degradation of the imidazole and piperazine rings, oxidative O-dealkylation and aromatic hydroxylation. About 13% of the dose is excreted in the urine, of which 2 to 4% is unchanged drug. The major route of excretion is through the bile into the intestinal tract. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span>, the plasma protein binding is about 99% mainly to the albumin fraction. Only a negligible proportion of ketoconazole reaches the cerebral-spinal fluid. Ketoconazole is a weak dibasic agent and thus requires acidity for dissolution and absorption.</p>
<p>Ketoconazole tablets are active against clinical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> with <span class="Italics">Blastomyces dermatitidis, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433968" conceptname="Candidiasis">Candida</span> spp., Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, and Phialophora spp.</span> Ketoconazole tablets are also active against <span class="Italics">Trichophyton spp., Epidermophyton spp., and Microsporum spp.</span> Ketoconazole is also active <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> against a variety of fungi and yeast.

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hepatotoxicity, primarily of the hepatocellular type, has been associated with the use of ketoconazole tablets, including rare fatalities. The reported incidence of hepatotoxicity has been about 1:10,000 exposed patients, but this probably represents some degree of under-reporting, as is the case for most reported adverse reactions to drugs. The median duration of ketoconazole tablet therapy in patients who developed symptomatic hepatotoxicity was about 28 days, although the range extended to as low as 3 days. The hepatic injury has usually, but not always, been reversible upon discontinuation of ketoconazole tablet treatment. Several cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> have been reported in children.</span></p>
<p>Prompt recognition of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver injury</span> is essential. Liver function tests (such as SGGT, alkaline phosphatase, SGPT, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4094657" conceptname="Aspartate aminotransferase">SGOT</span> and bilirubin) should be measured before starting treatment and at frequent intervals during treatment. Patients receiving ketoconazole tablets concurrently with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs should be carefully monitored, particularly those patients requiring prolonged therapy or those who have had a history of liver disease.</p>
<p>Most of the reported cases of hepatic toxicity have to date been in patients treated for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4215978" conceptname="Onychomycosis">onychomycosis</span>. Of 180 patients worldwide developing idiosyncratic liver dysfunction during ketoconazole tablet therapy, 61.3% had <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4215978" conceptname="Onychomycosis">onychomycosis</span> and 16.8% had chronic recalcitrant dermatophytoses.</p>
<p>Transient minor elevations in liver enzymes have occurred during treatment with ketoconazole tablets. The drug should be discontinued if these persist, if the abnormalities worsen, or if the abnormalities become accompanied by symptoms of possible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver injury</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">In rare cases <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylaxis</span> has been reported after the first dose.</span> Several cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span> including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="139900" conceptname="Urticaria">urticaria</span> have also been reported.</p>
<p>Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets and terfenadine has led to elevated plasma concentrations of terfenadine which may prolong QT intervals, sometimes resulting in life- threatening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac dysrhythmias</span>. Cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135823" conceptname="Torsades de pointes">torsades de pointes</span> and other serious ventricular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">dysrhythmias</span>, in rare cases leading to fatality, have been reported among patients taking terfenadine concurrently with ketoconazole tablets. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets and terfenadine is contraindicated.</p>
<p>Coadministration of astemizole with ketoconazole tablets is contraindicated. (See <span class="Bold">BOX WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS,</span> and <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span> sections.)</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with cisapride is contraindicated because it has resulted in markedly elevated cisapride plasma concentrations and prolonged QT interval, and has rarely been associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135823" conceptname="Torsades de pointes">torsades de pointes</span>. (See <span class="Bold">BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS</span> and <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span> sections.)</p>
<p>In European clinical trials involving 350 patients with metastatic prostatic cancer, eleven <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> were reported within two weeks of starting treatment with high doses of ketoconazole tablets (1200 mg/day). It is not possible to ascertain from the information available whether <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> was related to ketoconazole therapy in these patients with serious underlying disease. However, high doses of ketoconazole tablets are known to suppress adrenal corticosteroid secretion.</p>
<p>In female rats treated three to six months with ketoconazole at dose levels of 80 mg/kg and higher, increased fragility of long bones, in some cases leading to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">fracture</span>, was seen. The maximum "no-effect" dose level in these studies was 20 mg/kg (2.5 times the maximum recommended human dose). The mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is obscure. Limited studies in dogs failed to demonstrate such an effect on the metacarpals and ribs.</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Ketoconazole tablets have been demonstrated to lower serum testosterone. Once therapy with ketoconazole has been discontinued, serum testosterone levels return to baseline values. Testosterone levels are impaired with doses of 800 mg per day and abolished by 1600 mg per day. Ketoconazole tablets also decrease ACTH induced corticosteroid serum levels at similar high doses. The recommended dose of 200 mg to 400 mg daily should be followed closely.</p>
<p>In four subjects with drug-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="193804" conceptname="Achlorhydria">achlorhydria</span>, a marked reduction in ketoconazole absorption was observed. Ketoconazole tablets require acidity for dissolution. If concomitant antacids, anticholinergics, and H<span class="Sub">2</span>-blockers are needed, they should be given at least two hours after administration of ketoconazole tablets. In cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="193804" conceptname="Achlorhydria">achlorhydria</span>, the patients should be instructed to dissolve each tablet in 4 mL aqueous solution of 0.2 N HCl. For ingesting the resulting mixture, they should use a drinking straw so as to avoid contact with the teeth. This administration should be followed with a cup of tap water.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Ketoconazole is a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets and drugs primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system may result in increased plasma concentrations of the drugs that could increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects. Therefore, unless otherwise specified, appropriate dosage adjustments may be necessary. The following drug interactions have been identified involving ketoconazole tablets and other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system.</p>
<p>Ketoconazole tablets inhibit the metabolism of terfenadine, resulting in an increased plasma concentration of terfenadine and a delay in the elimination of its acid metabolite. The increased plasma concentration of terfenadine or its metabolite may result in prolonged QT intervals. (See <span class="Bold">BOX WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS,</span> and <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span> sections.)</p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic data indicate that oral ketoconazole inhibits the metabolism of astemizole, resulting in elevated plasma levels of astemizole and its active metabolite desmethylastemizole which may prolong QT intervals. Coadministration of astemizole with ketoconazole tablets is therefore contraindicated. (See <span class="Bold">BOX WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS,</span> and <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span> sections.)</p>
<p>Human pharmacokinetics data indicate that oral ketoconazole potently inhibits the metabolism of cisapride resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride. Data suggest that coadministration of oral ketoconazole and cisapride can result in prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG. Therefore concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with cisapride is contraindicated. (See <span class="Bold">BOX WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS</span> and <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span> sections.)</p>
<p>Ketoconazole tablets may alter the metabolism of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and methylprednisolone, resulting in elevated plasma concentrations of the latter drugs. Dosage adjustment may be required if cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or methylprednisolone are given concomitantly with ketoconazole tablets.</p>
<p>Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with midazolam or triazolam has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of the latter two drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. These agents should not be used in patients treated with ketoconazole tablets. If midazolam is administered parenterally, special precaution is required since the sedative effect may be prolonged.</p>
<p>Rare cases of elevated plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported. It is not clear whether this was due to the combination of therapy. It is, therefore, advisable to monitor digoxin concentrations in patients receiving ketoconazole.</p>
<p>When taken orally, imidazole compounds like ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs. In simultaneous treatment with imidazole drugs and coumarin drugs, the anticoagulant effect should be carefully titrated and monitored.</p>
<p>Because severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> has been reported in patients concomitantly receiving oral miconazole (an imidazole) and oral hypoglycemic agents, such a potential interaction involving the latter agents when used concomitantly with ketoconazole tablets (an imidazole) can not be ruled out.</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with phenytoin may alter the metabolism of one or both of the drugs. It is suggested to monitor both ketoconazole and phenytoin.</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of rifampin with ketoconazole tablets reduces the blood levels of the latter. INH (Isoniazid) is also reported to affect ketoconazole concentrations adversely. These drugs should not be given concomitantly.</p>
<p>After the coadministration of 200 mg oral ketoconazole twice daily and one 20 mg dose of loratadine to 11 subjects, the AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of loratadine averaged 302% (Â± 142 S.D.) and 251% (Â± 68 S.D.), respectively, of those obtained after co-treatment with placebo. The AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of descarboethoxyloratadine, an active metabolite, averaged 155% (Â± 27 S.D.) and 141% (Â± 35 S.D.), respectively. However, no related changes were noted in the QT<span class="Sub">c</span> on ECG taken at 2, 6, and 24 hours after the coadministration. Also, there were no clinically significant differences in adverse events when loratadine was administered with or without ketoconazole.</p>
<p>Rare cases of disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol have been reported. These experiences have been characterized by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318566" conceptname="Flushing">flushing</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4094513" conceptname="Ankle edema">peripheral edema</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>.

<h4>Pregnancy Category C</h4>
<p class="First">Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day (10 times the maximum recommended human dose). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, evidence of which also was seen at this and higher dose levels.</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<h3>Nonteratogenic Effects</h3>
<p class="First">Ketoconazole has also been found to be embryotoxic in the rat when given in the diet at doses higher than 80 mg/kg during the first trimester of gestation. In addition, dystocia (difficult labor) was noted in rats administered oral ketoconazole during the third trimester of gestation. This occurred when ketoconazole was administered at doses higher than 10 mg/kg (higher than 1.25 times the maximum human dose).</p>
<p>It is likely that both the malformations and the embryotoxicity resulting from the administration of oral ketoconazole during gestation are a reflection of the particular sensitivity of the female rat to this drug. For example, the oral LD<span class="Sub">50</span> of ketoconazole given by gavage to the female rat is 166 mg/kg whereas in the male rat the oral LD<span class="Sub">50</span> is 287 mg/kg.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">In rare cases, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylaxis</span> has been reported after the first dose.</span> Several cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span> including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="139900" conceptname="Urticaria">urticaria</span> have also been reported.

Most of these reactions were mild and transient and rarely required discontinuation of ketoconazole tablets. In contrast, the rare occurrences of hepatic dysfunction require special attention (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span> section).</p>
<p>In worldwide postmarketing experience with ketoconazole tablets there have been rare reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133280" conceptname="Alopecia">alopecia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4193492" conceptname="Acroparesthesia">paresthesia</span>, and signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154803" conceptname="Raised intracranial pressure">increased intracranial pressure</span> including bulging fontanelles and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4308632" conceptname="Optic disc edema">papilledema</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440360" conceptname="Pure hyperglyceridemia">Hypertriglyceridemia</span> has also been reported but a causal association with ketoconazole is uncertain.</p>
<p>Neuropsychiatric disturbances, including suicidal tendencies and severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, have occurred rarely in patients using ketoconazole tablets.</p>
<p>Ventricular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">dysrhythmias</span> (prolonged QT intervals) have occurred with the concomitant use of terfenadine with ketoconazole tablets. (See <span class="Bold">BOX WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS,</span> and <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span> sections.)</p>
<p>Data suggest that coadministration of ketoconazole tablets and cisapride can result in prolongation of the QT interval and has rarely been associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span>.

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Adults</span>: The recommended starting dose of ketoconazole tablets is a single daily administration of 200 mg (one tablet). In very serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> or if clinical responsiveness is insufficient within the expected time, the dose of ketoconazole may be increased to 400 mg (two tablets) once daily.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Children</span>: In small numbers of children over 2 years of age, a single daily dose of 3.3 to 6.6 mg/kg has been used. Ketoconazole tablets have not been studied in children under 2 years of age.</p>
<p>There should be laboratory as well as clinical documentation of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> prior to starting ketoconazole therapy. Treatment should be continued until tests indicate that active <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432248" conceptname="Opportunistic mycosis">fungal infection</span> has subsided. Inadequate periods of treatment may yield poor response and lead to early recurrence of clinical symptoms. Minimum treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433968" conceptname="Candidiasis">candidiasis</span> is one or two weeks. Patients with chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4104522" conceptname="Mucocutaneous candidiasis">mucocutaneous candidiasis</span> usually require maintenance therapy. Minimum treatment for the other indicated systemic mycoses is six months.</p>
<p>Minimum treatment for recalcitrant dermatophyte <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> is four weeks in cases involving glabrous skin. Palmar and plantar <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> may respond more slowly. Apparent cures may subsequently recur after discontinuation of therapy in some cases.</p>
