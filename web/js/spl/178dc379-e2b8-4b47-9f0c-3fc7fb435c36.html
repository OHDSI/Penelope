</table>Maximum serum concentrations are attained 1 to 2 hours after oral dosing. Mean concentrations 12 hours after dosing with 250, 500, or 750 mg are 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 Î¼g/mL, respectively. The serumÂ elimination half-life in subjects with normal renal function is approximately 4 hours. Serum concentrations increase proportionately with doses up to 1000 mg.<br><br>A 500 mg oral dose given every 12 hours has been shown to produce an area under the serum concentration time curve (AUC) equivalent to that produced by an intravenous infusion of 400 mg ciprofloxacin given over 60 minutes every 12 hours. A 750 mg oral dose given every 12 hours has been shown to produce an AUC at steady-state equivalent to that produced by an intravenous infusion of 400 mg given over 60 minutes every 8 hours.

<h2>Distribution:</h2>
<br>The binding of ciprofloxacin to serum proteins is 20 to 40% which is not likely to be high enough to cause significant protein binding interactions with other drugs.<br><br>After oral administration, ciprofloxacin is widely distributed throughout the body. Tissue concentrations often exceed serum concentrations in both men and women, particularly in genital tissue including the prostate. Ciprofloxacin is present in active form in the saliva, nasal and bronchial secretions, mucosa of the sinuses, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4102774" conceptname="Productive cough">sputum</span>, skin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443720" conceptname="Blister">blister</span> fluid, lymph, peritoneal fluid, bile, and prostatic secretions. Ciprofloxacin has also been detected in lung, skin, fat, muscle, cartilage, and bone. The drug diffuses into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); however, CSF concentrations are generally less than 10% of peak serum concentrations. Low levels of the drug have been detected in the aqueous and vitreous humors of the eye.Â  <br>

<h2>Metabolism:</h2>
<br>Four metabolites have been identified in human urine which together account for approximately 15% of an oral dose. The metabolites have antimicrobial activity, but are less active than unchanged ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin is an inhibitor of human cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) mediated metabolism. Coadministration of ciprofloxacin with other drugs primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 results in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and could lead to clinically significant adverse events of the coadministered drug (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_5">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span><span class="Bold">; <a href="#Section_6">WARNINGS</a>; </span><span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_7.4">PRECAUTIONS:  Drug Interactions</a></span>).</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="Section_3.4"></a><a name="section-3.4"></a><p></p>
<h2>Excretion:</h2>
<br>The serum elimination half-life in subjects with normal renal function is approximately 4 hours. Approximately 40 to 50% of an orally administered dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. After a 250 mg oral dose, urine concentrations of ciprofloxacin usually exceed 200 Î¼g/mL during the first two hours and are approximately 30 Î¼g/mL at 8 to 12 hours after dosing. The urinary excretion of ciprofloxacin is virtually complete within 24 hours after dosing. The renal clearance of ciprofloxacin, which is approximately 300 mL/minute, exceeds the normal glomerular filtration rate of 120 mL/minute. Thus, active tubular secretion would seem to play a significant role in its elimination. Co-administration of probenecid with ciprofloxacin results in about a 50% reduction in the ciprofloxacin renal clearance and a 50% increase in its concentration in the systemic circulation. Although bile concentrations of ciprofloxacin are several fold higher than serum concentrations after oral dosing, only a small amount of the dose administered is recovered from the bile as unchanged drug. An additional 1 to 2% of the dose is recovered from the bile in the form of metabolites. Approximately 20 to 35% of an oral dose is recovered from the feces within 5 days after dosing. This may arise from either biliary clearance or transintestinal elimination.<br>Â </div>

<h2>Drug-drug Interactions:</h2>
<br>When Ciprofloxacin Tablets USP, 250 mg, 500 mg and 750 mg is given concomitantly with food, there is a delay in the absorption of the drug, resulting in peak concentrations that occur closer to 2 hours after dosing rather than 1 hour. The overall absorption of Ciprofloxacin Tablets USP, 250 mg, 500 mg and 750 mg however, is not substantially affected. Concurrent administration of antacids containing magnesium hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide may reduce the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by as much as 90%. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_7">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>.)<br>Â <br>The serum concentrations of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole were not altered when these two drugs were given concomitantly.<br>Â <br>Concomitant administration with tizanidine is contraindicated. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_5">CONTRAINDICATIONS.</a></span>)<br><br>Concomitant administration of ciprofloxacin with theophylline decreases the clearance of theophylline resulting in elevated serum theophylline levels and increased risk of a patient developing CNS or other adverse reactions. Ciprofloxacin also decreases caffeine clearance and inhibits the formation of paraxanthine after caffeine administration. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_6">WARNINGS</a>: </span><span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_7">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>.)</div>

<a name="Section_3.6"></a><a name="section-3.6"></a><p></p>
<h2>Special Populations:</h2>
<br>Pharmacokinetic studies of the oral (single dose) and intravenous (single and multiple dose) forms of ciprofloxacin indicate that plasma concentrations of ciprofloxacin are higher in elderly subjects (&gt; 65 years) as compared to young adults. Although the C<span class="Sub">max</span> is increased 16- 40%, the increase in mean AUC is approximately 30%, and can be at least partially attributed to decreased renal clearance in the elderly. Elimination half-life is only slightly (~20%) prolonged in the elderly. These differences are not considered clinically significant. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_7.11">PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use</a></span>.)<br>Â <br>In patients with reduced renal function, the half-life of ciprofloxacin is slightly prolonged. Dosage adjustments may be required. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_11">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>.)<br><br>In preliminary studies in patients with stable chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4064161" conceptname="Cirrhosis of liver">liver cirrhosis</span>, no significant changes in ciprofloxacin pharmacokinetics have been observed. The kinetics of ciprofloxacin in patients with acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic insufficiency</span>, however, have not been fully elucidated.<br>Â </div>

<h2>MICROBIOLOGY</h2>
<br>Ciprofloxacin has <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms. The bactericidal action of ciprofloxacin results from inhibition of the enzymes topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, which are required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination. The mechanism of action of fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, is different from that of penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, macrolides, and tetracyclines; therefore, microorganisms resistant to these classes of drugs may be susceptible to ciprofloxacin and other quinolones. There is no known cross-resistance between ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobials. <span class="Italics">In vitro </span>resistance to ciprofloxacin develops slowly by multiple step mutations.<br>Â <br>Ciprofloxacin is slightly less active when tested at acidic pH. The inoculum size has little effect when tested <span class="Italics">in vitro. </span>The minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) generally does not exceed the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) by more than a factor of 2.<br><br>Ciprofloxacin has been shown to be active against most <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of the following microorganisms, both <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>and in clinical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> as described in the <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_4">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</a></span> section of the package insert for Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride Tablets USP, 250mg, 500mg and 750mg.<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">

This risk is further increased in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroid therapy. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77081" conceptname="Tibialis tendinitis">Tendinitis</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="76202" conceptname="Non-traumatic rupture of Achilles tendon">tendon rupture</span> can involve the Achilles, hand, shoulder, or other tendon sites and can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after fluoroquinolone treatment have been reported. Caution should be used when prescribing Ciprofloxacin Tablets
USP, 250 mg, 500 mg and 750 mg to elderly patients especially those on corticosteroids. Patients should be informed of this potential side effect and advised to discontinue Ciprofloxacin Tablets USP, 250 mg, 500 mg and 750 mg and contact their healthcare provider if any symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77081" conceptname="Tibialis tendinitis">tendinitis</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="76202" conceptname="Non-traumatic rupture of Achilles tendon">tendon rupture</span> occur (See <span class="Bold"><span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_0">BOXED WARNING</a></span>, <a href="#Section_6">WARNINGS</a>,</span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_11.3">ADVERSE REACTIONS/Post-Marketing Adverse Event Reports</a>).</span><br><br>In a retrospective analysis of 23 multiple-dose controlled clinical trials of ciprofloxacin encompassing over 3500 ciprofloxacin treated patients, 25% of patients were greater than or equal to 65 years of age and 10% were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals on any drug therapy cannot be ruled out. Ciprofloxacin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>. No alteration of dosage is necessary for patients greater than 65 years of age with normal renal function. However, since some older individuals experience reduced renal function by virtue of their advanced age, care should be taken in dose selection for elderly patients, and renal function monitoring may be useful in these patients. (See <span class="Bold"><span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_3">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_11">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>.)<br>Â <br>In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. Therefore, precaution should be taken when using Ciprofloxacin Tablets USP 250 mg, 500 mg and 750 mg with concomitant drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (e.g., class IA or class III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135823" conceptname="Torsades de pointes">torsade de pointes</span> (e.g., known QT prolongation, uncorrected <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>).</div>

The duration of therapy was 10 to 21 days (mean duration of treatment was 11 days with a range of 1 to 88 days). The primary objective of the study was to assess musculoskeletal and neurological safety within 6 weeks of therapy and through one year of follow-up in the 335 ciprofloxacin- and 349 comparator-treated patients enrolled.<br>Â <br>An Independent Pediatric Safety Committee (IPSC) reviewed all cases of musculoskeletal adverse events as well as all patients with an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437643" conceptname="Abnormal gait">abnormal gait</span> or abnormal joint exam (baseline or treatment-emergent).

The affected joints included: knee, elbow, ankle, hip, wrist, and shoulder. Within 6 weeks of treatment initiation, the rates of these events were 9.3% (31/335) in the ciprofloxacin-treated group versus 6% (21/349) in comparator-treated patients. The majority of these events were mild or moderate in intensity. All musculoskeletal events occurring by 6 weeks resolved (clinical resolution of signs and symptoms), usually within 30 days of end of treatment. Radiological evaluations were not routinely used to confirm resolution of the events. The events occurred more frequently in ciprofloxacin-treated patients than control patients, regardless of whether they received I.V. or oral therapy. Ciprofloxacin-treated patients were more likely to report more than one event and on more than one occasion compared to control patients. These events occurred in all age groups and the rates were consistently higher in the ciprofloxacin group compared to the control group. At the end of 1 year, the rate of these events reported at any time during that period was 13.7% (46/335) in the ciprofloxacin-treated group versus 9.5% (33/349) comparator-treated patients.<br><br>An adolescent female discontinued ciprofloxacin for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77074" conceptname="Joint pain">wrist pain</span> that developed during treatment.

<h2>Post-Marketing Adverse Event Reports:</h2>
<br>The following adverse events have been reported from worldwide marketing experience with quinolones, including ciprofloxacin. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these events in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the event, (2) frequency of the reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to the drug.<br><br><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">Agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition"

The stomach should be emptied by inducing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> or by gastric lavage. The patient should be carefully observed and given supportive treatment, including monitoring of renal function and administration of magnesium, aluminum, or calcium containing antacids which can reduce the absorption of ciprofloxacin.

<h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION - ADULTS</h2>
<br>Ciprofloxacin Tablets USP 250 mg, 500 mg and 750 mg should be administered orally to adults as described in the Dosage Guidelines table.<br><br>The determination of dosage for any particular patient must take into consideration the severity and nature of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, the susceptibility of the causative organism, the integrity of the patientâ€™s host-defense mechanisms, and the status of renal function and hepatic function.<br><br>The duration of treatment depends upon the severity of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>. The usual duration is 7 to 14 days; however, for severe and complicated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> more prolonged therapy may be required. Ciprofloxacin should be administered at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after magnesium/aluminum antacids, or sucralfate, VidexÂ® (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder for oral solution, other highly buffered drugs, or other products containing calcium, iron or zinc.Â <br><a name="i29195b33-0349-4cad-8088-758fb4ae2fce"></a><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<h1>ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<br>Ciprofloxacin and other quinolones have been shown to cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="73553" conceptname="Arthropathy">arthropathy</span> in immature animals of most species tested. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_6">WARNINGS</a></span>.) Damage of weight bearing joints was observed in juvenile dogs and rats. In young beagles, 100 mg/kg ciprofloxacin, given daily for 4 weeks, caused degenerative articular changes of the knee joint. At 30 mg/kg, the effect on the joint was minimal. In a subsequent study in young beagle dogs, oral ciprofloxacin doses of 30 mg/kg and 90 mg/kg ciprofloxacin (approximately 1.3- and 3.5-times the pediatric dose based upon comparative plasma AUCs) given daily for 2 weeks caused articular changes which were still observed by histopathology after a treatment-free period of 5 months. AtÂ 10 mg/kg (approximately 0.6-times the pediatric dose based upon comparative plasma AUCs), no effects on joints were observed. This dose was also not associated with arthrotoxicity after an additional treatment-free period of 5 months. In another study, removal of weight bearing from the joint reduced the lesions but did not totally prevent them.<br><br><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4188213" conceptname="Crystalluria">Crystalluria</span>, sometimes associated with secondary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">nephropathy</span>, occurs in laboratory animals dosed with ciprofloxacin. This is primarily related to the reduced solubility of ciprofloxacin under alkaline conditions, which predominate in the urine of test animals; in man, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4188213" conceptname="Crystalluria">crystalluria</span> is rare since human urine is typically acidic. In rhesus monkeys, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4188213" conceptname="Crystalluria">crystalluria</span> without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">nephropathy</span> was noted after single oral doses as low as 5 mg/kg. (approximately 0.07-times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). After 6 months of intravenous dosing at 10 mg/kg/day, no nephropathological changes were noted; however, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">nephropathy</span> was observed after dosing at 20 mg/kg/day for the same duration (approximately 0.2-times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>).<br><br>In dogs, ciprofloxacin at 3 and 10 mg/kg by rapid I.V. injection (15 sec.) produces pronounced hypotensive effects. These effects are considered to be related to histamine release, since they are partially antagonized by pyrilamine, an antihistamine. In rhesus monkeys, rapid I.V. injection also produces <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> but the effect in this species is inconsistent and less pronounced.<br><br>In mice, concomitant administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as phenylbutazone and indomethacin with quinolones has been reported to enhance the CNS stimulatory effect of quinolones.<br><br>Ocular toxicity seen with some related drugs has not been observed in ciprofloxacin-treated animals.</div>

<br>The mean serum concentrations of ciprofloxacin associated with a statistically significant improvement in survival in the rhesus monkey model of inhalational <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438960" conceptname="Anthrax">anthrax</span> are reached or exceeded in adult and pediatric patients receiving oral and intravenous regimens. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_11">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>.) Ciprofloxacin pharmacokinetics have been evaluated in various human populations. The mean peak serum concentration achieved at steady-state in human adults receiving 500 mg orally every 12 hours is 2.97 Î¼g/mL, and 4.56 Î¼g/mL following 400 mg intravenously every 12 hours. The mean trough serum concentration at steady-state for both of these regimens is 0.2 Î¼g/mL. In a study of 10 pediatric patients between 6 and 16 years of age, the mean peak plasma concentration achieved is 8.3 Î¼g/mL and trough concentrations range from 0.09 to 0.26 Î¼g/mL, following two 30-minute intravenous infusions of 10 mg/kg administered 12 hours apart. After the second intravenous infusion patients switched to 15 mg/kg orally every 12 hours achieve a mean peak concentration of 3.6 Î¼g/mL after the initial oral dose. Long-term safety data, including effects on cartilage, following the administration of ciprofloxacin to pediatric patients are limited. (For additional information, see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_7.10">PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use</a></span>.) Ciprofloxacin serum concentrations achieved in humans serve as a surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit and provide the basis for this indication.<span class="Sup">5</span><br><br>A placebo-controlled animal study in rhesus monkeys exposed to an inhaled mean dose of 11 LD<span class="Sub">50</span> (~5.5 x 10<span class="Sup">5</span> spores (range 5-30 LD<span class="Sub">50</span>) of <span class="Italics">B. anthracis </span>was conducted. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin for the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438960" conceptname="Anthrax">anthrax</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span> used in this study was 0.08 Î¼g/mL. In the animals studied, mean serum concentrations of ciprofloxacin achieved at expected T<span class="Sub">max</span> (1 hour post-dose) following oral dosing to steady-state ranged from 0.98 to 1.69 Î¼g/mL. Mean steady-state trough concentrations at 12 hours post-dose ranged from 0.12 to 0.19 Î¼g/mL.<span class="Sup">6</span> Mortality due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438960" conceptname="Anthrax">anthrax</span> for animals that received a 30-day regimen of oral ciprofloxacin beginning 24 hours post-exposure was significantly lower (1/9), compared to the placebo group (9/10) [p=0.001]. The one ciprofloxacin-treated animal that died of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438960" conceptname="Anthrax">anthrax</span> did so following the 30-day drug administration period.<span class="Sup">7</span><br><br>More than 9300 persons were recommended to complete a minimum of 60 days of antibiotic prophylaxis against possible inhalational exposure to <span class="Italics">B. anthracis</span> during 2001. Ciprofloxacin was recommended to most of those individuals for all or part of the prophylaxis regimen. Some persons were also given <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438960" conceptname="Anthrax">anthrax</span> vaccine or were switched to alternative antibiotics. No one who received ciprofloxacin or other therapies as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118659" conceptname="Prophylactic">prophylactic</span> treatment subsequently developed inhalational <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438960" conceptname="Anthrax">anthrax</span>. The number of persons who received ciprofloxacin as all or part of their post-exposure prophylaxis regimen is unknown.<br>Â <br>Among the persons surveyed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 1000 reported receiving ciprofloxacin as sole post-exposure prophylaxis for inhalational <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438960" conceptname="Anthrax">anthrax</span>.

This higher incidence, in the absence of a control group, could be explained by a reporting bias, concurrent medical conditions, other concomitant medications, emotional stress or other confounding factors, and/or a longer treatment period with ciprofloxacin. Because of these factors and limitations in the data collection, it is difficult to evaluate whether the reported symptoms were drug-related.</div>
