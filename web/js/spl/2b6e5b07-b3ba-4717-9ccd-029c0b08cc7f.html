<h3>Mechanism of Action: Antiviral</h3>
<p class="First">The mechanism by which amantadine exerts its antiviral activity is not clearly understood. It appears to mainly prevent the release of infectious viral nucleic acid into the host cell by interfering with the function of the transmembrane domain of the viral M2 protein. In certain cases, amantadine is also known to prevent virus assembly during virus replication. It does not appear to interfere with the immunogenicity of inactivated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4266367" conceptname="Influenza">influenza</span> A virus vaccine.</p>

<h3>Mechanism of Action: Parkinson's Disease </h3>
<p class="First">The mechanism of action of amantadine in the treatment of Parkinsonâ€™s disease and drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions is not known.  Data from earlier animal studies suggest that Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP may have direct and indirect effects on dopamine neurons.  More recent studies have demonstrated that amantadine is a weak, non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist (K<span class="Sub">i</span>=10 ÂµM).  Although amantadine has not been shown to possess direct anticholinergic activity in animal studies, clinically, it exhibits anticholinergic-like side effects such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226991" conceptname="Aptyalism">dry mouth</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192450" conceptname="Retention of urine">urinary retention</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">constipation</span>.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP is well absorbed orally. Maximum plasma concentrations are directly related to dose for doses up to 200 mg/day. Doses above 200 mg/day may result in a greater than proportional increase in maximum plasma concentrations. It is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Eight metabolites of amantadine have been identified in human urine. One metabolite, an N-acetylated compound, was quantified in human urine and accounted for 5 to 15% of the administered dose. Plasma acetylamantadine accounted for up to 80% of the concurrent amantadine plasma concentration in 5 of 12 healthy volunteers following the ingestion of a 200 mg dose of amantadine. Acetylamantadine was not detected in the plasma of the remaining seven volunteers. The contribution of this metabolite to efficacy or toxicity is not known.</p>
<p>There appears to be a relationship between plasma amantadine concentrations and toxicity. As concentration increases, toxicity seems to be more prevalent, however, absolute values of amantadine concentrations associated with adverse effects have not been fully defined. </p>
<p>After oral administration of a single dose of 100 mg amantadine hydrochloride oral solution to five healthy volunteers, the mean <span class="Underline">+</span> SD maximum plasma concentration C<span class="Sub">max</span> was 0.24 <span class="Underline">+</span> 0.04 mcg/mL and ranged from 0.18 to 0.28 mcg/mL.  After 15 days of amantadine 100 mg b.i.d., the C<span class="Sub">max</span> was 0.47 <span class="Underline">+</span> 0.11 mcg/mL in four of the five volunteers.   </p>
<p>Plasma amantadine clearance ranged from 0.2 to 0.3 L/hr/kg after the administration of 5 mg to 25 mg intravenous doses of amantadine to 15 healthy volunteers.</p>
<p>In six healthy volunteers, the ratio of amantadine renal clearance to apparent oral plasma clearance was 0.79 Â± 0.17 (mean Â± SD).</p>
<p>The volume of distribution determined after the intravenous administration of amantadine to 15 healthy subjects was 3 to 8 L/kg, suggesting tissue binding.  Amantadine, after single oral 200 mg doses to 6 healthy young subjects and to 6 healthy elderly subjects, has been found in nasal mucus at mean <span class="Underline">+</span> SD concentrations of 0.15 <span class="Underline">+</span> 0.16, 0.28 <span class="Underline">+</span> 0.26, and 0.39 <span class="Underline">+</span> 0.34 mcg/g at 1, 4, and 8 hours after dosing, respectively.  These concentrations represented 31 <span class="Underline">+</span> 33%, 59 <span class="Underline">+</span> 61%, and 95 <span class="Underline">+</span> 86% of the corresponding plasma amantadine concentrations.  Amantadine is approximately 67% bound to plasma proteins over a concentration range of 0.1 to 2 mcg/mL.  Following the administration of amantadine 100 mg as a single dose, the mean <span class="Underline">+</span> SD red blood cell to plasma ratio ranged from 2.7 <span class="Underline">+</span> 0.5 in 6 healthy subjects to 1.4 <span class="Underline">+</span> 0.2 in 8 patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>.  </p>
<p>The apparent oral plasma clearance of amantadine is reduced and the plasma half-life and plasma concentrations are increased in healthy elderly individuals age 60 and older. After single dose administration of 25 to 75 mg to 7 healthy, elderly male volunteers, the apparent plasma clearance of amantadine was 0.10 Â± 0.04 L/hr/kg (range: 0.06 to 0.17 L/hr/kg) and the half-life was 29 Â± 7 hours (range: 20 to 41 hours). Whether these changes are due to decline in renal function or other age related factors is not known.</p>
<p>In a study of young healthy subjects (n=20), mean renal clearance of amantadine, normalized for body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> index, was 1.5 fold higher in males compared to females (p&lt;0.032).</p>
<p>Compared with otherwise healthy adult individuals, the clearance of amantadine is significantly reduced in adult patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>. The elimination half-life increases two to three fold or greater when creatinine clearance is less than 40 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span> and averages eight days in patients on chronic maintenance hemodialysis. Amantadine is removed in negligible amounts by hemodialysis.</p>
<p>The pH of the urine has been reported to influence the excretion rate of amantadine. Since the excretion rate of amantadine increases rapidly when the urine is acidic, the administration of urine acidifying drugs may increase the elimination of the drug from the body.</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP should not be discontinued abruptly in patients with Parkinsonâ€™s disease since a few patients have experienced a parkinsonian crisis, i.e., a sudden marked clinical deterioration, when this medication was suddenly stopped.  The dose of anticholinergic drugs or of Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP should be reduced if atropine-like effects appear when these drugs are used concurrently.  Abrupt discontinuation may also precipitate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373995" conceptname="Delirium">delirium</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="444401" conceptname="Delusions">delusions</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438737" conceptname="Acute paranoid reaction">paranoid reaction</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4229897" conceptname="Stupor">stupor</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196636" conceptname="Dysarthria">slurred speech</span>.  </p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="379802" conceptname="Neuroleptic malignant syndrome">Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome</span> (NMS)</h2>
<p class="First">Sporadic cases of possible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="379802" conceptname="Neuroleptic malignant syndrome">Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome</span> (NMS) have been reported in association with dose reduction or withdrawal of Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP therapy.  Therefore, patients should be observed carefully when the dosage of Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP is reduced abruptly or discontinued, especially if the patient is receiving neuroleptics.</p>
<p>NMS is an uncommon but life-threatening syndrome characterized by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4178904" conceptname="Body temperature above reference range">hyperthermia</span>; neurologic findings including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4050941" conceptname="Muscle rigidity">muscle rigidity</span>, involuntary movements, altered consciousness; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436222" conceptname="Altered mental status">mental status changes</span>; other disturbances such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434633" conceptname="Disorder of autonomic nervous system">autonomic dysfunction</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317376" conceptname="Tachypnea">tachypnea</span>, hyper- or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>; laboratory findings such as creatine phosphokinase elevation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438398" conceptname="Leukocytosis">leukocytosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439142" conceptname="Myoglobinuria">myoglobinuria</span>, and increased serum myoglobin.</p>
<p>The early diagnosis of this condition is important for the appropriate management of these patients. Considering NMS as a possible diagnosis and ruling out other acute illnesses (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255848" conceptname="Pneumonia">pneumonia</span>, systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, etc.) is essential. This may be especially complex if the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4181404" conceptname="Heat stroke">heat stroke</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">drug fever</span> and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.</p>
<p>The management of NMS should include: 1) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 2) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. Dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine, and muscle relaxants, such as dantrolene are often used in the treatment of NMS, however, their effectiveness has not been demonstrated in controlled studies.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">Renal disease</span></h2>
<p class="First">Because Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP is mainly excreted in the urine, it accumulates in the plasma and in the body when renal function declines.  Thus, the dose of Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP should be reduced in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> and in individuals who are 65 years of age or older (see <a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_inv-db3e0fed-750a-4a4f-9345-8a617b0fc75e">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>; <a href="#i4i_section_id_inv-234ac36b-5d0d-4d31-8869-b83ecb0a0eee">Dosage for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Impaired Renal Function</span></a>).  </p>

<h2>Liver disease</h2>
<p class="First">Care should be exercised when administering Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP to patients with liver disease.

<h2>Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors</h2>
<p class="First">Postmarketing reports suggest that patients treated with anti-Parkinson medications can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money uncontrollably, and other intense urges.  Patients may be unable to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinsonâ€™s disease and that increase central dopaminergic tone, including Amantadine hydrochloride.  In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued.  Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4023166" conceptname="Gambling">gambling</span> urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending or other urges while being treated with Amantadine hydrochloride.  Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking Amantadine hydrochloride.  </p>

<h2>Melanoma</h2>
<p class="First">Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinsonâ€™s disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population.  Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinsonâ€™s disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinsonâ€™s disease, is unclear. </p>
<p>For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP for <span class="Italics">any</span> indication.  Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists).   </p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Careful observation is required when Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP is administered concurrently with central nervous system stimulants.  </p>
<p>Agents with anticholinergic properties may potentiate the anticholinergic-like side effects of amantadine.  </p>
<p>Coadministration of thioridazine has been reported to worsen the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span> in elderly patients with Parkinsonâ€™s disease, however, it is not known if other phenothiazines produce a similar response.  </p>
<p>Coadministration of Dyazide (triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide) resulted in a higher plasma amantadine concentration in a 61-year-old man receiving amantadine hydrochloride 100 mg TID for Parkinsonâ€™s disease.<span class="Sup">1</span>  It is not known which of the components of Dyazide contributed to the observation or if related drugs produce a similar response.  </p>
<p>Coadministration of quinine or quinidine with amantadine was shown to reduce the renal clearance of amantadine by about 30%.  </p>
<p>The concurrent use of Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP with live attenuated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4266367" conceptname="Influenza">influenza</span> vaccine (LAIV) intranasal has not been evaluated.  However, because of the potential for interference between these products, LAIV should not be administered within 2 weeks before or 48 hours after administration of Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP, unless medically indicated.  The concern about possible interference arises from the potential for antiviral drugs to inhibit replication of live vaccine virus.  Trivalent inactivated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4266367" conceptname="Influenza">influenza</span> vaccine can be administered at any time relative to use of Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis</h2>
<p class="First">Long-term <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> animal studies designed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP have not been performed.

<h2>Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">The effect of amantadine on fertility has not been adequately tested, that is, in a study conducted under Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and according to current recommended methodology.  In a three litter, non-GLP, reproduction study in rats, Amantadine hydrochloride at a dose of 32 mg/kg/day (equal to the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) administered to both males and females slightly impaired fertility.  There were no effects on fertility at a dose level of 10 mg/kg/day (or 0.3 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis); intermediate doses were not tested.  </p>
<p>Failed fertility has been reported during human <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> fertilization (IVF) when the sperm donor ingested amantadine 2 weeks prior to, and during the IVF cycle.  </p>

<h2>Pregnancy:  Teratogenic Effects:  Pregnancy Category C</h2>
<p class="First">The effect of amantadine on embryofetal and peri-postnatal development has not been adequately tested, that is, in studies conducted under Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and according to current recommended methodology.  However, in two non-GLP studies in rats in which females were dosed from 5 days prior to mating to Day 6 of gestation or on Days 7 to 14 of gestation, Amantadine hydrochloride  produced increases in embryonic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> at an oral dose of 100 mg/kg (or 3 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).  In the non-GLP rat study in which females were dosed on Days 7 to 14 of gestation, there was a marked increase in severe visceral and skeletal malformations at oral doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg (or 1.5 and 3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).  The no-effect dose for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> was 37 mg/kg (equal to the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).  The safety margins reported may not accurately reflect the risk considering the questionable quality of the study on which they are based.  There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.  Human data regarding <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> after maternal use of amantadine is scarce.  </p>

<p>There is no specific antidote for an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> of Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP.  However, slowly administered intravenous physostigmine in 1 and 2 mg doses in an adult<span class="Sup">2</span> at 1- to 2-hour intervals and 0.5 mg doses in a child<span class="Sup">3</span> at 5- to 10-minute intervals up to a maximum of 2 mg/hour have been reported to be effective in the control of central nervous system toxicity caused by amantadine hydrochloride.  For acute overdosing, general supportive measures should be employed along with immediate gastric lavage or induction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span>.  Fluids should be forced, and if necessary, given intravenously.  The pH of the urine has been reported to influence the excretion rate of Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP.  Since the excretion rate of Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP increases rapidly when the urine is acidic, the administration of urine acidifying drugs may increase the elimination of the drug from the body.  The blood pressure, pulse, respiration and temperature should be monitored.  The patient should be observed for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">hyperactivity</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>; if required, sedation and anticonvulsant therapy should be administered.

<h3>Adult</h3>
<p class="First">The adult daily dosage of Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP is 200 mg (four teaspoonfuls of oral solution) as a single daily dose.  The daily dosage may be split into 100 mg (two teaspoonfuls of oral solution) twice a day.  If central nervous system effects develop in once-a-day dosage, a split dosage schedule may reduce such complaints.  In persons 65 years of age or older, the daily dosage of Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP is 100 mg.  </p>
<p>A 100 mg daily dose has also been shown in experimental challenge studies to be effective as prophylaxis in healthy adults who are not at high risk for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4266367" conceptname="Influenza">influenza</span>-related complications.  However, it has not been demonstrated that a 100 mg daily dose is as effective as a 200 mg daily dose for prophylaxis, nor has the 100 mg daily dose been studied in the treatment of acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4266367" conceptname="Influenza">influenza</span> illness.  In recent clinical trials, the incidence of central nervous system (CNS) side effects associated with the 100 mg daily dose was at or near the level of placebo.  The 100 mg dose is recommended for persons who have demonstrated intolerance to 200 mg of Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP daily because of CNS or other toxicities.</p>

<p>The usual dose of Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP is 100 mg twice a day when used alone.  Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP has an onset of action usually within 48 hours.  </p>
<p>The initial dose of Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP is 100 mg daily for patients with serious associated medical illnesses or who are receiving high doses of other antiparkinson drugs.  After one to several weeks at 100 mg once daily, the dose may be increased to 100 mg twice daily, if necessary.  </p>
<p>Occasionally, patients whose responses are not optimal with Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP at 200 mg daily may benefit from an increase up to 400 mg daily in divided doses.  However, such patients should be supervised closely by their physicians.  </p>
<p>Patients initially deriving benefit from Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP not uncommonly experience a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span>-off of effectiveness after a few months.  Benefit may be regained by increasing the dose to 300 mg daily.  Alternatively, temporary discontinuation of Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP for several weeks, followed by reinitiation of the drug, may result in regaining benefit in some patients.  A decision to use other antiparkinson drugs may be necessary.  </p>

<h2>Dosage for Concomitant Therapy</h2>
<p class="First">Some patients who do not respond to anticholinergic antiparkinson drugs may respond to Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP.  When Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP or anticholinergic antiparkinson drugs are each used with marginal benefit, concomitant use may produce additional benefit.  </p>
<p>When Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP and levodopa are initiated concurrently, the patient can exhibit rapid therapeutic benefits.  Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP should be held constant at 100 mg daily or twice daily while the daily dose of levodopa is gradually increased to optimal benefit.  </p>
<p>When Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP is added to optimal well-tolerated doses of levodopa, additional benefit may result, including smoothing out the fluctuations in improvement which sometimes occur in patients on levodopa alone.  Patients who require a reduction in their usual dose of levodopa because of development of side effects may possibly regain lost benefit with the addition of Amantadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP.  </p>
