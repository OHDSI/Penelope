THESE REACTIONS ARE ESTIMATED TO OCCUR IN 1 TO 6 PER 10,000 NEW USERS IN COUNTRIES WITH MAINLY CAUCASIAN POPULATIONS, BUT THE RISK IN SOME ASIAN COUNTRIES IS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT 10 TIMES HIGHER. STUDIES IN PATIENTS OF CHINESE ANCESTRY HAVE FOUND A STRONG ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE RISK OF DEVELOPING SJS/TEN AND THE PRESENCE OF HLA-B*1502, AN INHERITED ALLELIC VARIANT OF THE HLA-B GENE. HLA-B*1502 IS FOUND ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN PATIENTS WITH ANCESTRY ACROSS BROAD AREAS OF ASIA. PATIENTS WITH ANCESTRY IN GENETICALLY AT-RISK POPULATIONS SHOULD BE SCREENED FOR THE PRESENCE OF HLA-B*1502 PRIOR TO INITIATING TREATMENT WITH TEGRETOL. PATIENTS TESTING POSITIVE FOR THE ALLELE SHOULD NOT BE TREATED WITH TEGRETOL UNLESS THE BENEFIT CLEARLY OUTWEIGHS THE RISK (SEE WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, LABORATORY TESTS).</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span></h1>
<p class="First">In controlled clinical trials, Tegretol has been shown to be effective in the treatment of psychomotor and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="374924" conceptname="Generalized convulsive epilepsy">grand mal seizures</span>, as well as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="379801" conceptname="Trigeminal neuralgia">trigeminal neuralgia</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></h2>
<p class="First">Tegretol has demonstrated anticonvulsant properties in rats and mice with electrically and chemically induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>. It appears to act by reducing polysynaptic responses and blocking the post-tetanic potentiation. Tegretol greatly reduces or abolishes <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> induced by stimulation of the infraorbital nerve in cats and rats. It depresses thalamic potential and bulbar and polysynaptic reflexes, including the linguomandibular reflex in cats. Tegretol is chemically unrelated to other anticonvulsants or other drugs used to control the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="379801" conceptname="Trigeminal neuralgia">trigeminal neuralgia</span>. The mechanism of action remains unknown.</p>
<p>The principal metabolite of Tegretol, carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, has anticonvulsant activity as demonstrated in several in vivo animal models of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>. Though clinical activity for the epoxide has been postulated, the significance of its activity with respect to the safety and efficacy of Tegretol has not been established.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="43682-4">
<a name="section-4.2"></a><p></p>
<h2><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span></h2>
<p class="First">In clinical studies, Tegretol suspension, conventional tablets, and XR tablets delivered equivalent amounts of drug to the systemic circulation. However, the suspension was absorbed somewhat faster, and the XR tablet slightly slower, than the conventional tablet. The bioavailability of the XR tablet was 89% compared to suspension. Following a b.i.d. dosage regimen, the suspension provides higher peak levels and lower trough levels than those obtained from the conventional tablet for the same dosage regimen. On the other hand, following a t.i.d. dosage regimen, Tegretol suspension affords steady-state plasma levels comparable to Tegretol tablets given b.i.d. when administered at the same total mg daily dose. Following a b.i.d. dosage regimen, Tegretol-XR tablets afford steady-state plasma levels comparable to conventional Tegretol tablets given q.i.d., when administered at the same total mg daily dose. Tegretol in blood is 76% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma levels of Tegretol are variable and may range from 0.5 to 25 mcg/mL, with no apparent relationship to the daily intake of the drug. Usual adult therapeutic levels are between 4 and 12 mcg/mL. In polytherapy, the concentration of Tegretol and concomitant drugs may be increased or decreased during therapy, and drug effects may be altered (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Following chronic oral administration of suspension, plasma levels peak at approximately 1.5 hours compared to 4 to 5 hours after administration of conventional Tegretol tablets, and 3 to 12 hours after administration of Tegretol-XR tablets. The CSF/serum ratio is 0.22, similar to the 24% unbound Tegretol in serum. Because Tegretol induces its own metabolism, the half-life is also variable. Autoinduction is completed after 3 to 5 weeks of a fixed dosing regimen. Initial half-life values range from 25 to 65 hours, decreasing to 12 to 17 hours on repeated doses. Tegretol is metabolized in the liver. Cytochrome P450 3A4 was identified as the major isoform responsible for the formation of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide from Tegretol. Human microsomal epoxide hydrolase has been identified as the enzyme responsible for the formation of the 10,11-transdiol derivative from carbamazepine-10,11 epoxide. After oral administration of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-carbamazepine, 72% of the administered radioactivity was found in the urine and 28% in the feces. This urinary radioactivity was composed largely of hydroxylated and conjugated metabolites, with only 3% of unchanged Tegretol.</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetic parameters of Tegretol disposition are similar in children and in adults. However, there is a poor correlation between plasma concentrations of carbamazepine and Tegretol dose in children. Carbamazepine is more rapidly metabolized to carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (a metabolite shown to be equipotent to carbamazepine as an anticonvulsant in animal screens) in the younger age groups than in adults. In children below the age of 15, there is an inverse relationship between CBZ-E/CBZ ratio and increasing age (in one report from 0.44 in children below the age of 1 year to 0.18 in children between 10 to 15 years of age).</p>
<p>The effects of race and gender on carbamazepine pharmacokinetics have not been systematically evaluated.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Serious Dermatologic Reactions</span></h2>
<p class="First">Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443754" conceptname="Lyell's toxic epidermal necrolysis, subepidermal type">toxic epidermal necrolysis</span> (TEN) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="141651" conceptname="Stevens-Johnson syndrome">Stevens-Johnson syndrome</span> (SJS), have been reported with Tegretol treatment. The risk of these events is estimated to be about 1 to 6 per 10,000 new users in countries with mainly Caucasian populations. However, the risk in some Asian countries is estimated to be about 10 times higher. Tegretol should be discontinued at the first sign of a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>, unless the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered.</p>

<h2>
<span class="Bold">SJS/TEN and HLA</span><span class="Bold">-B*1502 Allele</span>
</h2>
<p class="First">Retrospective case-control studies have found that in patients of Chinese ancestry there is a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN with carbamazepine treatment and the presence of an inherited variant of the HLA-B gene, HLA-B*1502. The occurrence of higher rates of these reactions in countries with higher frequencies of this allele suggests that the risk may be increased in allele-positive individuals of any ethnicity.</p>
<p>Across Asian populations, notable variation exists in the prevalence of HLA-B*1502. Greater than 15% of the population is reported positive in Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, and parts of the Philippines, compared to about 10% in Taiwan and 4% in North China. South Asians, including Indians, appear to have intermediate prevalence of HLA-B*1502, averaging 2% to 4%, but higher in some groups. HLA-B*1502 is present in less than 1% of the population in Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>HLA-B*1502 is largely absent in individuals not of Asian origin (e.g., Caucasians, African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Prior to initiating Tegretol therapy, testing for HLA</span><span class="Bold">-B*1502 should be performed in patients with ancestry in populations in which HLA</span><span class="Bold">-B*1502 may be present. </span>In deciding which patients to screen, the rates provided above for the prevalence of HLA-B*1502 may offer a rough guide, keeping in mind the limitations of these figures due to wide variability in rates even within ethnic groups, the difficulty in ascertaining ethnic ancestry, and the likelihood of mixed ancestry. Tegretol should not be used in patients positive for HLA-B*1502 unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Tested patients who are found to be negative for the allele are thought to have a low risk of SJS/TEN (see BOXED WARNING and PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests).</p>
<p>Over 90% of Tegretol treated patients who will experience SJS/TEN have this reaction within the first few months of treatment. This information may be taken into consideration in determining the need for screening of genetically at-risk patients currently on Tegretol.</p>
<p>The HLA-B*1502 allele has not been found to predict risk of less severe adverse cutaneous reactions from Tegretol such as maculopapular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">eruption</span> (MPE) or to predict Drug Reaction with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302954" conceptname="Disorder characterized by eosinophilia">Eosinophilia</span> and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS).</p>
<p>Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Chinese ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. Consideration should be given to avoiding use of other drugs associated with SJS/TEN in HLA-B*1502 positive patients, when alternative therapies are otherwise equally acceptable.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">Hypersensitivity Reactions</span> and HLA-A*3101 Allele</span></h2>
<p class="First">Retrospective case-control studies in patients of European, Korean, and Japanese ancestry have found a moderate association between the risk of developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span> and the presence of HLA-A*3101, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA-A gene, in patients using carbamazepine.  These <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span> include SJS/TEN, maculopapular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">eruptions</span>, and Drug Reaction with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302954" conceptname="Disorder characterized by eosinophilia">Eosinophilia</span> and Systemic Symptoms (see DRESS/Multiorgan <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> below).</p>
<p>HLA-A*3101 is expected to be carried by more than 15% of patients of Japanese, Native American, Southern Indian (for example, Tamil Nadu) and some Arabic ancestry; up to about 10% in patients of Han Chinese, Korean, European, Latin American, and other Indian ancestry; and up to about 5% in African-Americans and patients of Thai, Taiwanese, and Chinese (Hong Kong) ancestry.</p>
<p>The risks and benefits of Tegretol therapy should be weighed before considering Tegretol in patients known to be positive for HLA-A*3101.</p>
<p>Application of HLA genotyping as a screening tool has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. Many HLA-B*1502-positive and HLA-A*3101-positive patients treated with Tegretol will not develop SJS/TEN or other <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span>, and these reactions can still occur infrequently in HLA-B*1502-negative and HLA-A*3101-negative patients of any ethnicity. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN and other <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span>, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring, have not been studied.</p>

<p class="First">Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including Tegretol, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</p>
<p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322252" conceptname="Suicidal behavior">suicidal behavior</span> or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>. </p>
<p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. </p>
<p>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Usage in Pregnancy</span></h2>
<p class="First">Carbamazepine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.</p>
<p>Epidemiological data suggest that there may be an association between the use of carbamazepine during pregnancy and congenital malformations, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4283381" conceptname="Spina bifida">spina bifida</span>. There have also been reports that associate carbamazepine with developmental disorders and congenital anomalies (e.g., craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196528" conceptname="Hypospadias">hypospadias</span>, and anomalies involving various body systems). <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436077" conceptname="Developmental delay">Developmental delays</span> based on neurobehavioral assessments have been reported. When treating or counseling women of childbearing potential, the prescribing physician will wish to weigh the benefits of therapy against the risks. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.</p>
<p>Retrospective case reviews suggest that, compared with monotherapy, there may be a higher prevalence of teratogenic effects associated with the use of anticonvulsants in combination therapy. Therefore, if therapy is to be continued, monotherapy may be preferable for pregnant women.</p>
<p>In humans, transplacental passage of carbamazepine is rapid (30 to 60 minutes), and the drug is accumulated in the fetal tissues, with higher levels found in liver and kidney than in brain and lung.</p>
<p>Carbamazepine has been shown to have adverse effects in reproduction studies in rats when given orally in dosages 10 to 25 times the maximum human daily dosage (MHDD) of 1200 mg on a mg/kg basis or 1.5 to 4 times the MHDD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. In rat teratology studies, 2 of 135 offspring showed kinked ribs at 250 mg/kg and 4 of 119 offspring at 650 mg/kg showed other anomalies (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135923" conceptname="Cleft palate">cleft palate</span>, 1; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134730" conceptname="Talipes">talipes</span>, 1; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434143" conceptname="Anophthalmos">anophthalmos</span>, 2). In reproduction studies in rats, nursing offspring demonstrated a lack of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span> and an unkempt appearance at a maternal dosage level of 200 mg/kg.</p>
<p>Antiepileptic drugs should not be discontinued abruptly in patients in whom the drug is administered to prevent major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> because of the strong possibility of precipitating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span> with attendant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxia</span> and threat to life. In individual cases where the severity and frequency of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> disorder are such that removal of medication does not pose a serious threat to the patient, discontinuation of the drug may be considered prior to and during pregnancy, although it cannot be said with any confidence that even minor <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> do not pose some hazard to the developing embryo or fetus.</p>
<p>Tests to detect defects using currently accepted procedures should be considered a part of routine prenatal care in childbearing women receiving carbamazepine.</p>
<p>There have been a few cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380533" conceptname="Convulsions in the newborn">neonatal seizures</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> associated with maternal Tegretol and other concomitant anticonvulsant drug use.

These symptoms may represent a neonatal withdrawal syndrome. </p>
<p>To provide information regarding the effects of in utero exposure to Tegretol, physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking Tegretol enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves.

<h2><span class="Bold">General</span></h2>
<p class="First">Before initiating therapy, a detailed history and physical examination should be made.</p>
<p>Tegretol should be used with caution in patients with a mixed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> disorder that includes atypical absence <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>, since in these patients Tegretol has been associated with increased frequency of generalized <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE).</p>
<p>Therapy should be prescribed only after critical benefit-to-risk appraisal in patients with a history of cardiac conduction disturbance, including second- and third-degree AV <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316135" conceptname="Atrioventricular block">heart block</span>; cardiac, hepatic, or renal damage; adverse hematologic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reaction</span> to other drugs, including reactions to other anticonvulsants; or interrupted courses of therapy with Tegretol.</p>
<p>AV <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316135" conceptname="Atrioventricular block">heart block</span>, including second- and third-degree block, have been reported following Tegretol treatment. This occurred generally, but not solely, in patients with underlying EKG abnormalities or risk factors for conduction disturbances.</p>
<p>Hepatic effects, ranging from slight elevations in liver enzymes to rare cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic failure</span> have been reported (see ADVERSE REACTIONS and PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests). In some cases, hepatic effects may progress despite discontinuation of the drug. In addition rare instances of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4146279" conceptname="Vanishing bile duct syndrome">vanishing bile duct syndrome</span> have been reported. This syndrome consists of a cholestatic process with a variable clinical course ranging from fulminant to indolent, involving the destruction and disappearance of the intrahepatic bile ducts. Some, but not all, cases are associated with features that overlap with other immunoallergenic syndromes such as multiorgan <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="45765791" conceptname="Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms">DRESS syndrome</span>) and serious dermatologic reactions. As an example there has been a report of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4146279" conceptname="Vanishing bile duct syndrome">vanishing bile duct syndrome</span> associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="141651" conceptname="Stevens-Johnson syndrome">Stevens-Johnson syndrome</span> and in another case an association with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302954" conceptname="Disorder characterized by eosinophilia">eosinophilia</span>.</p>
<p>Since a given dose of Tegretol suspension will produce higher peak levels than the same dose given as the tablet, it is recommended that patients given the suspension be started on lower doses and increased slowly to avoid unwanted side effects (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</p>
<p>Tegretol suspension contains sorbitol and, therefore, should not be administered to patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance. </p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Information for Patients</span></h2>
<p class="First">Patients should be informed of the availability of a Medication Guide and they should be instructed to read the Medication Guide before taking Tegretol. </p>
<p>Patients should be made aware of the early toxic signs and symptoms of a potential hematologic problem, as well as dermatologic, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> or hepatic reactions.

The patient should be advised that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, the patient should be advised that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised that serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089139" conceptname="Skin reaction">skin reactions</span> have been reported in association with Tegretol. In the event a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089139" conceptname="Skin reaction">skin reaction</span> should occur while taking Tegretol, patients should consult with their physician immediately (see WARNINGS). </p>
<p>Patients, their caregivers, and families should be counseled that AEDs, including Tegretol, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.</p>
<p>Tegretol may interact with some drugs. Therefore, patients should be advised to report to their doctors the use of any other prescription or nonprescription medications or herbal products.</p>
<p>Caution should be exercised if alcohol is taken in combination with Tegretol therapy, due to a possible additive sedative effect.</p>
<p>Since <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> may occur, patients should be cautioned about the hazards of operating machinery or automobiles or engaging in other potentially dangerous tasks.</p>
<p>Patients should be encouraged to enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. To enroll, patients can call the toll free number 1-888-233-2334 (see WARNINGS, Usage in Pregnancy subsection).</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Laboratory Tests</span></h2>
<p class="First">For genetically at-risk patients (see WARNINGS), high-resolution ‘<span class="Italics">HLA</span><span class="Italics">-B*1502 typing</span>’ is recommended. The test is positive if either one or two HLA-B*1502 alleles are detected and negative if no HLA-B*1502 alleles are detected.</p>
<p>Complete pretreatment blood counts, including platelets and possibly reticulocytes and serum iron, should be obtained as a baseline. If a patient in the course of treatment exhibits low or decreased white blood cell or platelet counts, the patient should be monitored closely. Discontinuation of the drug should be considered if any evidence of significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4145241" conceptname="Bone marrow depression">bone marrow depression</span> develops.</p>
<p>Baseline and periodic evaluations of liver function, particularly in patients with a history of liver disease, must be performed during treatment with this drug since <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver damage</span> may occur (see PRECAUTIONS, General and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Carbamazepine should be discontinued, based on clinical judgment, if indicated by newly occurring or worsening clinical or laboratory evidence of liver dysfunction or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">hepatic damage</span>, or in the case of active liver disease.</p>
<p>Baseline and periodic eye examinations, including slit-lamp, funduscopy, and tonometry, are recommended since many phenothiazines and related drugs have been shown to cause eye changes.</p>
<p>Baseline and periodic complete urinalysis and BUN determinations are recommended for patients treated with this agent because of observed renal dysfunction.</p>
<p>Monitoring of blood levels (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY) has increased the efficacy and safety of anticonvulsants. This monitoring may be particularly useful in cases of dramatic increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> frequency and for verification of compliance. In addition, measurement of drug serum levels may aid in determining the cause of toxicity when more than one medication is being used.</p>

<p class="First">When carbamazepine is given with drugs that can increase or decrease carbamazepine levels, close monitoring of carbamazepine levels is indicated and dosage adjustment may be required.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Agents That Increase Carbamazepine Levels</span></p>
<p>CYP3A4 inhibitors inhibit Tegretol metabolism and can thus increase plasma carbamazepine levels. Drugs that have been shown, or would be expected, to increase plasma carbamazepine levels include aprepitant, cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, danazol, diltiazem, macrolides, erythromycin, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, trazodone, olanzapine, loratadine, terfenadine, omeprazole, oxybutynin, dantrolene, isoniazid, niacinamide, nicotinamide, ibuprofen, propoxyphene, azoles (e.g., ketaconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, voriconazole), acetazolamide, verapamil, ticlopidine, grapefruit juice, and protease inhibitors. </p>
<p>Human microsomal epoxide hydrolase has been identified as the enzyme responsible for the formation of the 10,11-transdiol derivative from carbamazepine-10,11 epoxide. Coadministration of inhibitors of human microsomal epoxide hydrolase may result in increased carbamazepine-10,11 epoxide plasma concentrations. Accordingly, the dosage of Tegretol should be adjusted and/or the plasma levels monitored when used concomitantly with loxapine, quetiapine, or valproic acid. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Agents That Decrease Carbamazepine Levels</span></p>
<p>CYP3A4 inducers can increase the rate of Tegretol metabolism. Drugs that have been shown, or that would be expected, to decrease plasma carbamazepine levels include cisplatin, doxorubicin HCl, felbamate, fosphenytoin, rifampin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, methsuximide, theophylline, aminophylline. </p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Effect of Tegretol on Plasma Levels of Concomitant Agents</span></h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Decreased Levels of Concomitant Medications</span></p>
<p>Tegretol is a potent inducer of hepatic 3A4 and is also known to be an inducer of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9/19 and may therefore reduce plasma concentrations of co-medications mainly metabolized by CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C9/19 and 3A4, through induction of their metabolism. When used concomitantly with Tegretol, monitoring of concentrations or dosage adjustment of these agents may be necessary:</p>
<ul>
<li>When carbamazepine is added to aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be doubled. Additional dose increases should be based on clinical evaluation. If carbamazepine is later withdrawn, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced.</li>
<li>When carbamazepine is used with tacrolimus, monitoring of tacrolimus blood concentrations and appropriate dosage adjustments are recommended.</li>
<li>The use of concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers such as carbamazepine should be avoided with temsirolimus. If patients must be coadministered carbamazepine with temsirolimus, an adjustment of temsirolimus dosage should be considered.</li>
<li>The use of carbamazepine with lapatinib should generally be avoided. If carbamazepine is started in a patient already taking lapatinib, the dose of lapatinib should be gradually titrated up.  If carbamazepine is discontinued, the lapatinib dose should be reduced.</li>
<li>Concomitant use of carbamazepine with nefazodone results in plasma concentrations of nefazodone and its active metabolite insufficient to achieve a therapeutic effect. Coadministration of carbamazepine with nefazodone is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).</li>
<li>Monitor concentrations of valproate when Tegretol is introduced or withdrawn in patients using valproic acid. </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, Tegretol causes, or would be expected to cause, decreased levels of the following drugs, for which monitoring of concentrations or dosage adjustment may be necessary: acetaminophen, albendazole, alprazolam, aprepitant, buprenorphone, bupropion, citalopram, clonazepam, clozapine, corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone, dexamethasone), cyclosporine, dicumarol, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g., felodipine), doxycycline, ethosuximide, everolimus, haloperidol, imatinib, itraconazole, lamotrigine, levothyroxine, methadone, methsuximide, mianserin, midazolam, olanzapine, oral and other hormonal contraceptives, oxcarbazepine, paliperidone, phensuximide, phenytoin, praziquantel, protease inhibitors, risperidone, sertraline, sirolimus, tadalafil, theophylline, tiagabine, topiramate, tramadol, trazodone, tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., imipramine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline), valproate, warfarin, ziprasidone, zonisamide.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Other Drug Interactions</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Cyclophosphamide is an inactive prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite in part by CYP3A.  The rate of metabolism and the leukopenic activity of cyclophosphamide are reportedly increased by chronic coadministration of CYP3A4 inducers.  There is a potential for increased cyclophosphamide toxicity when coadministered with carbamazepine.</li>
<li>Concomitant administration of carbamazepine and lithium may increase the risk of neurotoxic side effects.</li>
<li>Concomitant use of carbamazepine and isoniazid has been reported to increase isoniazid-induced hepatotoxicity.</li>
<li>Concomitant medication with Tegretol and some diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide) may lead to symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">hyponatremia</span>.</li>
<li>Alterations of thyroid function have been reported in combination therapy with other anticonvulsant medications.</li>
<li>Concomitant use of Tegretol with hormonal contraceptive products (e.g., oral, and levonorgestrel subdermal implant contraceptives) may render the contraceptives less effective because the plasma concentrations of the hormones may be decreased. Breakthrough <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> and unintended pregnancies have been reported. Alternative or back-up methods of contraception should be considered.</li>
<li>Resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents pancuronium, vecuronium, rocuronium and cisatracurium has occurred in patients chronically administered carbamazepine.  Whether or not carbamazepine has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">neuromuscular blockade</span> than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher.</li>

<h2><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</span></h2>
<p class="First">Carbamazepine, when administered to Sprague-Dawley rats for two years in the diet at doses of 25, 75, and 250 mg/kg/day, resulted in a dose-related increase in the incidence of hepatocellular tumors in females and of benign interstitial cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> in the testes of males.</p>

<p class="First">Tegretol and its epoxide metabolite are transferred to breast milk. The ratio of the concentration in breast milk to that in maternal plasma is about 0.4 for Tegretol and about 0.5 for the epoxide. The estimated doses given to the newborn during breastfeeding are in the range of 2 to 5 mg daily for Tegretol and 1 to 2 mg daily for the epoxide.</p>
<p>Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from carbamazepine, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<p>The prognosis in cases of severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">poisoning</span> is critically dependent upon prompt elimination of the drug, which may be achieved by inducing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, irrigating the stomach, and by taking appropriate steps to diminish absorption.

<h1><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (SEE TABLE BELOW)</span></h1>
<p class="First">Tegretol suspension in combination with liquid chlorpromazine or thioridazine results in precipitate formation, and, in the case of chlorpromazine, there has been a report of a patient passing an orange rubbery precipitate in the stool following coadministration of the two drugs (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Because the extent to which this occurs with other liquid medications is not known, Tegretol suspension should not be administered simultaneously with other liquid medications or diluents.</p>
<p>Monitoring of blood levels has increased the efficacy and safety of anticonvulsants (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests). Dosage should be adjusted to the needs of the individual patient. A low initial daily dosage with a gradual increase is advised. As soon as adequate control is achieved, the dosage may be reduced very gradually to the minimum effective level. Medication should be taken with meals.</p>
<p>Since a given dose of Tegretol suspension will produce higher peak levels than the same dose given as the tablet, it is recommended to start with low doses (children 6 to 12 years: ½ teaspoon q.i.d.) and to increase slowly to avoid unwanted side effects.</p>
<p>Conversion of patients from oral Tegretol tablets to Tegretol suspension: Patients should be converted by administering the same number of mg per day in smaller, more frequent doses (i.e., b.i.d. tablets to t.i.d. suspension).</p>
<p>Tegretol-XR is an extended-release formulation for twice-a-day administration. When converting patients from Tegretol conventional tablets to Tegretol-XR, the same total daily mg dose of Tegretol-XR should be administered. <span class="Bold">Tegretol</span><span class="Bold">-XR tablets must be swallowed whole and never crushed or chewed. </span>Tegretol-XR tablets should be inspected for chips or cracks. Damaged tablets, or tablets without a release portal, should not be consumed. Tegretol-XR tablet coating is not absorbed and is excreted in the feces; these coatings may be noticeable in the stool.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">Epilepsy</span> </span>(SEE INDICATIONS AND USAGE)</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Adults and children over 12 years of age-Initial: </span>Either 200 mg b.i.d. for tablets and XR tablets, or 1 teaspoon q.i.d. for suspension (400 mg/day). Increase at weekly intervals by adding up to 200 mg/day using a b.i.d. regimen of Tegretol-XR or a t.i.d. or q.i.d. regimen of the other formulations until the optimal response is obtained. Dosage generally should not exceed 1000 mg daily in children 12 to 15 years of age, and 1200 mg daily in patients above 15 years of age. Doses up to 1600 mg daily have been used in adults in rare instances. <span class="Bold Italics">Maintenance: </span>Adjust dosage to the minimum effective level, usually 800 to 1200 mg daily.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Children 6 to 12 years of age-Initial: </span>Either 100 mg b.i.d. for tablets or XR tablets, or ½ teaspoon q.i.d. for suspension (200 mg/day). Increase at weekly intervals by adding up to 100 mg/day using a b.i.d. regimen of Tegretol-XR or a t.i.d. or q.i.d. regimen of the other formulations until the optimal response is obtained. Dosage generally should not exceed 1000 mg daily.<span class="Bold Italics"> Maintenance:</span> Adjust dosage to the minimum effective level, usually 400 to 800 mg daily.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Children under 6 years of age-Initial: </span>10 to 20 mg/kg/day b.i.d. or t.i.d. as tablets, or q.i.d. as suspension. Increase weekly to achieve optimal clinical response administered t.i.d. or q.i.d. <span class="Bold Italics">Maintenance: </span>Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 35 mg/kg. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the therapeutic range. No recommendation regarding the safety of carbamazepine for use at doses above 35 mg/kg/24 hours can be made.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Combination Therapy: </span>Tegretol may be used alone or with other anticonvulsants. When added to existing anticonvulsant therapy, the drug should be added gradually while the other anticonvulsants are maintained or gradually decreased, except phenytoin, which may have to be increased (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions, and Pregnancy Category D).</p>

<p><span class="Bold Italics">Initial:</span><span class="Bold"> </span>On the first day, either 100 mg b.i.d. for tablets or XR tablets, or ½ teaspoon q.i.d. for suspension, for a total daily dose of 200 mg. This daily dose may be increased by up to 200 mg/day using increments of 100 mg every 12 hours for tablets or XR tablets, or 50 mg (½ teaspoon) q.i.d. for suspension, only as needed to achieve freedom from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>. Do not exceed 1200 mg daily. <span class="Bold Italics">Maintenance:</span> Control of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> can be maintained in most patients with 400 to 800 mg daily. However, some patients may be maintained on as little as 200 mg daily, while others may require as much as 1200 mg daily. At least once every 3 months throughout the treatment period, attempts should be made to reduce the dose to the minimum effective level or even to discontinue the drug.</p>
