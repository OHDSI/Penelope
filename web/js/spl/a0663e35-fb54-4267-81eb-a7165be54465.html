<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p><a name="ID8"></a>Phenytoin is an antiepileptic drug which can be used in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>. The primary site of action appears to be the <span class="Italics">motor cortex </span>where spread of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> activity is inhibited. Possibly by promoting sodium efflux from neurons, phenytoin tends to <span class="Italics">stabilize </span>the threshold against <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">hyperexcitability</span> caused by excessive stimulation or environmental changes capable of reducing membrane sodium gradient. This includes the reduction of posttetanic potentiation at synapses. Loss of posttetanic potentiation prevents cortical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> foci from detonating adjacent cortical areas. Phenytoin reduces the maximal activity of brain stem centers responsible for the tonic phase of tonic-clonic (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="374924" conceptname="Generalized convulsive epilepsy">grand mal</span>) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>.</p>
<p>The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5-7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day.</p>
<p>When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5-7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. For Extended Phenytoin Sodium Capsules, USP   peak serum levels occur 4 to 12 hours after administration.</p>
<p>Optimum control without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum levels between 10 and 20 mcg/mL, although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="374924" conceptname="Generalized convulsive epilepsy">grand mal</span>) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. </p>
<p>In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, congenital enzyme deficiency, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin plasma levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal.</p>
<p>Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but more importantly by tubular secretion. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high plasma levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more.</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS &amp; USAGE</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p><a name="ID10"></a>Extended Phenytoin Sodium Capsules, USP are indicated for the control of generalized tonic-clonic (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="374924" conceptname="Generalized convulsive epilepsy">grand mal</span>) and complex partial (psychomotor, temporal lobe) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> and prevention and treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> occurring during or following neurosurgery.</p>
<p>Phenytoin serum level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments (see <a href="#ID47">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION </a> and <a href="#ID7">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a> sections). </p>

<h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p><a name="ID12"></a>Phenytoin is contraindicated in those patients who are hypersensitive to phenytoin or other hydantoins.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p><a name="ID14"></a>Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span>. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative antiepileptic medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reaction</span>, rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an antiepileptic drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><a name="ID16"></a>Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including extended phenytoin sodium capsules, USP, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. </p>
<p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono-and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322252" conceptname="Suicidal behavior">suicidal behavior</span> or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>. </p>
<p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. </p>
<p>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. </p>

<p><a name="ID18"></a>The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> and psychiatric indications. </p>
<p>Anyone considering prescribing extended phenytoin sodium capsules, USP or any other AED must balance this risk with the risk of untreated illness. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">Epilepsy</span> and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. </p>
<p>Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm.

Periodic measurement of plasma phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage (see <a href="#ID21">PRECAUTIONS</a>, <a href="#ID26">Laboratory Tests</a>).

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p><a name="ID23"></a>The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4326594" conceptname="Abnormal liver function">impaired liver function</span>, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity.</p>
<p>A small percentage of individuals who have been treated with phenytoin have been shown to metabolize the drug slowly. Slow metabolism may be due to limited enzyme availability and lack of induction; it appears to be genetically determined.</p>
<p>Phenytoin should be discontinued if a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">skin rash</span> appears (see <a href="#ID13">WARNINGS </a> section regarding drug discontinuation). If the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> is exfoliative, purpuric, or bullous or if <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255891" conceptname="Lupus erythematosus">lupus erythematosus</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="141651" conceptname="Stevens-Johnson syndrome">Stevens-Johnson syndrome</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443754" conceptname="Lyell's toxic epidermal necrolysis, subepidermal type">toxic epidermal necrolysis</span> is suspected, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered.

<p><a name="ID27"></a>Phenytoin serum level determinations may be necessary to achieve optimal dosage adjustments.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><a name="ID29"></a>There are many drugs which may increase or decrease phenytoin levels or which phenytoin may affect. Serum level determinations for phenytoin are especially helpful when possible drug interactions are suspected. The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: </p>
<ol>
<li>Drugs which may increase phenytoin serum levels include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H<span class="Sub">2</span>-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone.</li>
<li>Drugs which may decrease phenytoin levels include: carbamazepine, chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433753" conceptname="Alcohol abuse">alcohol abuse</span>, reserpine, and sucralfate. Moban<span class="Sup">®</span> brand of molindone hydrochloride contains calcium ions which interfere with the absorption of phenytoin. Ingestion times of phenytoin and antacid preparations containing calcium should be staggered in patients with low serum phenytoin levels to prevent absorption problems.</li>
<li>Drugs which may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels include: phenobarbital, sodium valproate, and valproic acid. Similarly, the effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid, and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable.</li>
<li>Although not a true drug interaction, tricyclic antidepressants may precipitate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> in susceptible patients and phenytoin dosage may need to be adjusted.</li>

The patient may become <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">comatose</span> and hypotensive. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Death</span> is due to respiratory and circulatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.</p>
<p>There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin plasma levels where toxicity may occur. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378165" conceptname="Nystagmus">Nystagmus</span>, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437584" conceptname="Ataxia">ataxia</span> at 30 mcg/mL; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196636" conceptname="Dysarthria">dysarthria</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4061577" conceptname="Lethargy">lethargy</span> appear when the plasma concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. </p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><a name="ID46"></a>Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote.</p>
<p>The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins.

<h1>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p><a name="ID48"></a>Serum concentrations should be monitored in changing from Extended Phenytoin Sodium Capsules, USP to Prompt Phenytoin Sodium Capsules, USP, and from the sodium salt to the free acid form.</p>
<p>Extended phenytoin capsules, USP 100 mg are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. The free acid form of phenytoin is used in other phenytoin products. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. </p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><a name="ID50"></a>Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments-the clinically effective serum level is usually 10-20 mcg/mL. With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><a name="ID52"></a><span class="Bold">Divided daily dosage:</span></p>
<p>Patients who have received no previous treatment may be started on one 100-mg Extended Phenytoin Sodium Capsules, USP three times daily and the dosage then adjusted to suit individual requirements. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be one capsule three to four times a day. An increase up to two capsules three times a day may be made, if necessary.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><a name="ID54"></a>In adults, if <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> control is established with divided doses of three 100-mg Extended Phenytoin Sodium capsules, USP, daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg of extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. Studies comparing divided doses of 300 mg with a single daily dose of this quantity indicated absorption, peak plasma levels, biologic half-life, difference between peak and minimum values, and urinary recovery were equivalent. Once-a-day dosage offers a convenience to the individual patient or to nursing personnel for institutionalized patients and is intended to be used only for patients requiring this amount of drug daily. A major problem in motivating noncompliant patients may also be lessened when patient can take this drug once a day. However, patients should be cautioned not to miss a dose, inadvertently. </p>
<p>Only extended phenytoin sodium capsules are recommended for once-a-day dosing. Inherent differences in dissolution characteristics and resultant absorption rates of phenytoin due to different manufacturing procedures and/or dosage forms preclude such recommendation for other phenytoin products. When a change in the dosage form or brand is prescribed, careful monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be carried out.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><a name="ID56"></a>Some authorities have advocated use of an oral loading dose of phenytoin in adults who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desirable. This dosing regimen should be reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting where phenytoin serum levels can be closely monitored. Patients with a history of renal or liver disease should not receive the oral loading regimen. </p>
<p>Initially, one gram of phenytoin capsules is divided into three doses (400 mg, 300 mg, 300 mg) and administered at two-hour intervals. Normal maintenance dosage is then instituted 24 hours after the loading dose, with frequent serum level determinations.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><a name="ID58"></a>Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily.</p>
<p>A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years old and adolescents may require the minimum adult dose (300 mg/day).</p>
