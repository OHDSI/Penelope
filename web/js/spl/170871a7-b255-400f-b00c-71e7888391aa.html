<p class="First"><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</span> SLENTROL should be prescribed as part of an overall weight management program that incorporates a complete and balanced canine diet and physical activity.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-5.1"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dietary Considerations:</span> SLENTROL should only be used with a commercial maintenance diet. Any diet changes should be made gradually and prior to initiating SLENTROL treatment. Better appetite control may be achieved in diets that are not restricted in fat content. Changing the diet while initiating treatment with SLENTROL should be avoided.</p>
<p>The dog will need to be weighed at the start of treatment and then at monthly intervals so that the dosing regimen can be adjusted according to the prescribing instructions below.</p>
<p>During the first month of therapy, the dosing regimen for SLENTROL consists of two fixed dose rates (number of mL administered per unit of body weight) in all dogs. In subsequent months of therapy, the recommended dosing regimen prescribed for SLENTROL varies for each individual dog and the dose volume must be specifically calculated each month, based on the amount of weight lost (expressed as a percent) during the previous month of therapy.</p>
<p>With regard to dosing it is important to note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial body weight is used to calculate the dose that is first administered.</li>
<li>Subsequent dose adjustments are made by adjusting the volume of solution administered.</li>
<li>Dose adjustments are determined at monthly intervals.</li>
<li>A diet change at the time of a dose escalation should be avoided.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Bold">The dose should not exceed a maximum daily dose of 0.2 mL/kg (0.09 mL/lb), based on the dog's current body weight, during any part of treatment.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="43678-2">
<a name="section-5.2"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dose Preparation and Administration:</span> To prepare for oral administration, remove the bottle cap and insert the supplied oral dosing syringe through the membrane into the bottle. Invert the bottle and withdraw the appropriate volume required using the graduation marks on the side of the oral dosing syringe.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">The 1 mL dosing syringe provided with SLENTROL can not accurately measure the dosage required to treat dogs that weigh less than 12.5 lb (5.7 kg).</span></p>
<p>A veterinarian or veterinary technician should instruct the pet owner/caregiver on how to measure the amount of SLENTROL to be administered to ensure accurate dosing.</p>
<p>SLENTROL can be administered directly into the dog's mouth or on a small amount of food. It can be given with a meal or at a different time of day.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Wipe the oral dosing syringe clean after each use with a clean dry cloth or disposable towel. Do not introduce water into the oral dosing syringe or the SLENTROL solution.</span></p>

<p>Assess the dog prior to initiation of therapy with SLENTROL to determine the desired weight and to assess the animal's general health (See <a href="#precautions">Precautions</a>).</p>
<p>The initial dosage of SLENTROL is 0.01 mL/kg (0.0045 mL/lb) body weight, administered once daily, orally, for the first 14 days. After the first 14 days of treatment, the dose volume of SLENTROL should be doubled to 0.02 mL/kg (0.009 mL/lb) of body weight, administered once daily for the next 14 days (days 15 to 28 of treatment).</p>

<h1>WEIGHT MANAGEMENT PHASE</h1>
<p class="First">A 3-month weight management phase is recommended to successfully maintain the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> achieved with treatment. During the weight management phase, the veterinarian and the pet owner should establish the optimal level of food intake and physical activity needed. SLENTROL administration should be continued during the weight management phase until the dog owner can establish the food intake and physical activity needed to stabilize body weight at the dog's desired weight.</p>
<p>To dose for weight management, body weight should continue to be assessed at monthly intervals.</p>
<ul class="Disc">
<li>
<span class="Bold">First dose adjustment</span><ul class="Disc">
<li>If the dog lost ≥1% body weight per week in the last month of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> phase, the dose volume (number of mL administered each day) should be decreased by 50% resulting in a decrease of the dose volume to 0.5 times the dose administered the previous month.</li>
<li>If the dog lost between 0 and 1% the dose should remain the same.</li>
<li>If the dog gained weight, the dose should be increased by 50% resulting in an increase of the dose volume to 1.5 times the dose administered the previous month.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">Subsequent dose adjustments</span><br>In subsequent months the dose volume should be increased or decreased by 25% to maintain a constant weight. 								<ul class="Disc">
<li>If the dog is within -5% to +5% of the body weight at the end of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> phase, the dose volume (number of mL administered each day) should remain unchanged.</li>
<li>If the dog lost &gt;5% body weight, then the dose should be decreased by 25%.</li>
<li>If the dog gained &gt;5% body weight, then the dose should be increased by 25%. Based on the dog's current body weight a daily dose of 0.2 mL/kg (0.09 mL/lb) should not be exceeded.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When SLENTROL is discontinued, the daily amount of food offered and physical activity should be continued as established during the weight management phase. Reverting to previous food intake or physical activity levels at this point can contribute to a re-gain of some or all of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> that has been achieved.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">INFORMATION FOR OWNER OR PERSON TREATING ANIMAL:</span> Successful implementation of any <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> program for dogs requires active, on-going communication between the dog owner/caretaker and the veterinary professional treating the pet. It is important that the prescribing veterinarian maintains an active veterinarian-client-patient relationship with the dog and the dog owner/caretaker during all phases of therapy and proactively communicates about their role in making the program successful in the short as well as the long-term. When drug therapy such as SLENTROL is included in the program, this discussion may include, but may not be limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>SLENTROL is not a cure for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433736" conceptname="Obesity">obesity</span>. The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">decreased appetite</span> experienced when dogs are treated with dirlotapide is only temporary and lasts no longer than 1-2 days beyond the cessation of therapy. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">Weight gain</span> will occur if the amount of food offered is not limited at the time SLENTROL is discontinued.</li>
<li>Successful, long-term weight management requires changes that extend beyond the period of drug therapy. To maintain the weight lost when treated with SLENTROL, the adjustments in dietary management as well as physical activity that were begun as part of the overall <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> program must be continued by the owner after drug therapy is discontinued.</li>
<li>SLENTROL decreases the food intake of the dog. A decrease in appetite and associated begging behavior can be expected with SLENTROL treatment. <span class="Bold">However, if total <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">inappetence</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">anorexia</span> is observed for more than one day, these signs should be reported to the prescribing veterinarian immediately.</span>
</li>
<li>Almost 1 in 4 of dogs placed on SLENTROL therapy experienced occasional episodes of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>.

The investigator referred the case to a neurologist and the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> continued approximately twice weekly. The neurologist found no lesions that support the causality of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>.</p>
<p>A 5 year old Dachshund developed a hepatopathy after 82 days of treatment and was withdrawn from the study for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, increased hepatic enzymes, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">anorexia</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">Vomiting</span> continued for a few days after stopping treatment and the dog was hospitalized due to the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">anorexia</span>. ALT activity levels continued to rise after all clinical observations resolved.</p>
<p>During weight stabilization, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> (16.1%) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4061577" conceptname="Lethargy">lethargy</span> (4.8%) were the most frequent adverse reactions associated with treatment with SLENTROL.

<p>In the post-treatment period, a 6 year old spayed female Chihuahua, was found dead by the owner 7 days after stopping dirlotapide therapy. The cause of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> was not conclusive but did not appear to be related to the dirlotapide therapy.</p>
<p>Some dogs treated with SLENTROL displayed a mild to moderate elevation in serum hepatic transaminase activity early in treatment that decreased over time while treatment continued. Hepatic transaminases generally returned to normal when treatment was discontinued (See <a href="#precautions">Precautions</a> for further information).</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</h1>
<p class="First">SLENTROL (dirlotapide) is a selective microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor that blocks the assembly and release of lipoproteins into the bloodstream. The mechanism of action for producing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> is not completely understood, but it seems to result from reduced fat absorption and a satiety signal from lipid-filled enterocytes.</p>
<p>SLENTROL mainly acts locally in the gut to reduce appetite, increase fecal fat and produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> in the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433736" conceptname="Obesity">obesity</span> in dogs. Dirlotapide is available systemically, but absorption in dogs is highly variable. Absorbed SLENTROL is metabolized in the liver. Dirlotapide and its metabolites are secreted in the bile and may undergo enterohepatic circulation. The fecal and biliary routes are the predominant routes of elimination. Dirlotapide in circulation is highly protein bound.</p>
<p>Although systemic blood levels do not directly correlate with effectiveness (effectiveness has been linked to drug concentrations in the gut), they seem to correlate with the systemic toxicity observed for this drug. Non-linear pharmacokinetics with less-than-proportional exposure, drug accumulation (at higher doses), and large inter-individual variability has been observed in multiple studies and at various dose levels. The mean elimination half-life ranged between 5 and 18 hours, and it seemed to increase with dose and with repeated dosing.</p>

<h1>EFFECTIVENESS:</h1>
<p class="First">The effectiveness of SLENTROL for the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433736" conceptname="Obesity">obesity</span> was confirmed in two controlled, multi-site field studies using client-owned dogs. The control dogs received corn oil. More than 65 different pure breeds and mixed breed dogs were represented in the 276 dogs receiving SLENTROL during the clinical field studies. SLENTROL was evaluated in dogs receiving 135 other commonly used veterinary products such as vaccines, anthelmintics, antiparasitics, antimicrobials, collars, shampoos, dips, short-acting oral steroid preparations, and otic, ophthalmic, and topical steroid preparations. SLENTROL was not tested concomitantly with long-acting steroid products, anabolic steroids, or other products known to affect appetite.</p>
<p>In one field study evaluated for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> only, SLENTROL was effective in producing ≥0.7% weekly (≥0.1% daily) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> at an initial dosage 0.023 mg/lb (0.05 mg/kg), doubled at 14 days, and then adjusted monthly for 4 months. Two hundred and fifty eight (88 control and 170 SLENTROL) obese dogs, from 23 veterinary clinics, 21 in the US and 2 in Canada, with a body condition score (BCS) ≥8 on a 9-point scale<span class="Sup">2</span>, participated in the study. SLENTROL-treated dogs lost a statistically significant (<span class="Italics">P</span>≤0.0001) 11.8% body weight and 39% lost ≥13% body weight, an amount that has been shown to provide a health benefit in obese dogs<span class="Sup">3</span>. At the end of treatment the final mean dosage was 0.12 mg/lb with a range of 0.05 mg/lb to 0.24 mg/lb (0.26 mg/kg, range 0.11 to 0.56 mg/kg) based on current body weight.</p>
<p>In a separate study, conducted at 14 different US veterinary clinics, 63 dogs that completed 4 months of SLENTROL treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> were evaluated for weight management during a 3 month retraining phase. The weight management period was designed to educate the owner on the optimal amount of food necessary and exercise required to maintain the dog's desired body weight. SLENTROL dosage was adjusted monthly (50% first adjustment and 25% subsequently) to maintain the desired body weight ± 5%.</p>
<p>Daily oral treatment with SLENTROL was safe and effectively stabilized body weight ± 5%, when adjusted monthly by 50% the first month and then by 25% monthly, as needed based on individual body weight changes. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">Vomiting</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4061577" conceptname="Lethargy">lethargy</span> still occurred during the weight management phase.</p>
<p>At the completion of the weight management phase, SLENTROL was discontinued and body weight measured for an additional 2 months. Dogs regained approximately 3% of their body weight in 2 months, primarily during the first month after treatment was discontinued (n = 51).</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438872" conceptname="Excessive eating - polyphagia">Polyphagia</span> was reported as an abnormal clinical finding in 8 of 106 dogs when SLENTROL was discontinued.</p>

ALT activity tended to gradually increase as the SLENTROL dose increased during the first 6 months of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> and then decreased during the next 6 months despite continued SLENTROL treatment at the weight stabilization dosage. Other clinical pathology changes included low total proteins, low serum albumin and globulins, low blood urea nitrogen and low serum creatinine compared to control dogs. Mean and individual values were usually within the published normal range. Gamma glutamyl transferase, and total bilirubin were not changed during 12 months of SLENTROL treatment. Other abnormal clinical pathology values included sporadic findings that were similar in the control dogs, were not progressive with continued treatment, and returned to normal concentrations during a one-month post treatment period.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Individual Responses:</span> A total of 10 of 48 dogs had sporadic mild to moderate ALT measurements that exceeded the upper limit of the reference range at some point during 12 months (maximum of 366 U/L) of SLENTROL treatment. The ALT elevations were not sustained despite continued treatment during the 6 months of weight stabilization. AST activity was marginally elevated in 1 of 48 dogs (maximum 84 U/L in a SLENTROL-treated dog and 116 U/L in a control dog) during 12 months of treatment. One dog, excluded from the totals, had a consistently elevated ALT and also had an elevated alkaline phosphatase prior to treatment. Except in this dog, no other changes in other liver function indicators accompanied these mild elevations in hepatic transaminases.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Fat Soluble Vitamins:</span> During the first 6 months of treatment, plasma vitamin A and E concentrations of the SLENTROL-treated dogs were significantly below the vitamin A and E concentrations of the control dogs. Plasma vitamin A concentration was low after one month and the median values did not decline any further. Plasma vitamin E concentrations were lowest after 6 months of SLENTROL treatment but adipose tissue levels of vitamin E appeared to be increased compared to control dogs after 12 months of treatment. Plasma vitamin A and E concentrations appeared to increase during the weight stabilization phase (second 6 months of treatment) and returned to concentrations similar to the control dogs when SLENTROL treatment was discontinued. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">Prothrombin</span> times were similar in the SLENTROL-treated and the control dogs and there were no clinical signs of abnormal hemostasis observed during the 12-month study.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">ABOUT SLENTROL</span></p>
<p>SLENTROL is a prescription medicine to help obese dogs lose weight. SLENTROL works, in the gut, to keep your dog from getting hungry. SLENTROL is not a cure for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433736" conceptname="Obesity">obesity</span> and should be used as part of an overall <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> program.</p>
<p>SLENTROL should be used with any maintenance food. Better appetite control may be achieved in diets that are not restricted in fat content. Talk with your veterinarian about any changes in what you feed your dog or how much you feed your dog before starting SLENTROL.</p>
<p>SLENTROL is not for cats or people.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">BEFORE YOUR DOG STARTS TAKING SLENTROL</span></p>
<p>Your veterinarian will make sure SLENTROL is right for your dog by:</p>
<ul class="Disc">

<li>checking if any other conditions commonly associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433736" conceptname="Obesity">obesity</span> (such as Cushing's, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140673" conceptname="Hypothyroidism">hypothyroidism</span>) are under control.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your veterinarian needs to make sure your dog has a healthy liver before starting SLENTROL.</p>
<p>SLENTROL is not for dogs that have been taking corticosteroids (like prednisolone) for a long time.</p>
<p>Also be sure to tell your veterinarian about any medications and supplements your dog is taking and the types of food that you feed your dog.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">HOW TO GIVE SLENTROL TO MY DOG</span></p>
<p>Give your dog SLENTROL once a day at about the same time, at meal time or between meals. Using the oral syringe provided in the package, either place the liquid medicine directly in the dog's mouth or put it on a small amount of food. If you miss a dose you may notice that your dog is acting hungry.</p>
<p>It is important to measure the exact amount of SLENTROL your dog needs. Ask your veterinarian to show you how much medicine should be in the oral syringe and how to place SLENTROL directly into your dog's mouth from the syringe.</p>
<p>If your dog weighs less than 12.5 pounds the syringe provided with the product can not accurately measure the amount of the medicine your dog needs.</p>
