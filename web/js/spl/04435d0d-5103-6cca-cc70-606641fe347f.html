<h2><span class="Bold">Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide</span></h2>
<p class="First">As a result of its <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuretic effects</span>, hydrochlorothiazide increases plasma renin activity, increases aldosterone secretion, and decreases serum potassium. Administration of lisinopril blocks the renin-angiotensin aldosterone axis and tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with the diuretic.</p>
<p>In clinical studies, the extent of blood pressure reduction seen with the combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide was approximately additive. The lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide 10/12.5 mg combination worked equally well in black and white patients. The lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide 20/12.5 mg and lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide 20/25 mg combinations appeared somewhat less effective in black patients, but relatively few black patients were studied. In most patients, the antihypertensive effect of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide was sustained for at least 24 hours. </p>
<p>In a randomized, controlled comparison, the mean antihypertensive effects of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 20/12.5 mg and lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 20/25 mg were similar, suggesting that many patients who respond adequately to the latter combination may be controlled with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 20/12.5 mg (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#_8a86ca91-41a7-374b-8f52-de1645d9f73f">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide has little or no effect on the bioavailability of either drug. The combination tablet is bioequivalent to concomitant administration of the separate entities. </p>

<h3><span class="Bold Italics">Mechanism of Action</span></h3>
<p class="First">Lisinopril inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. In hypertensive patients with normal renal function treated with lisinopril alone for up to 24 weeks, the mean increase in serum potassium was less than 0.1 mEq/L; however, approximately 15% of patients had increases greater than 0.5 mEq/L and approximately 6% had a decrease greater than 0.5 mEq/L. In the same study, patients treated with lisinopril plus a thiazide diuretic showed essentially no change in serum potassium (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#PRECAUTIONS">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>). </p>
<p>ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin.  Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of lisinopril remains to be elucidated. </p>
<p>While the mechanism through which lisinopril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, lisinopril is antihypertensive even in patients with low-renin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>. Although lisinopril was antihypertensive in all races studied, black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to lisinopril monotherapy than nonblack patients. </p>

<h3><span class="Bold Italics">Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</span></h3>
<p class="First">Following oral administration of lisinopril, peak serum concentrations occur within about 7 hours. Declining serum concentrations exhibit a prolonged terminal phase which does not contribute to drug accumulation. This terminal phase probably represents saturable binding to ACE and is not proportional to dose. Lisinopril does not appear to be bound to other serum proteins. </p>
<p>Lisinopril does not undergo metabolism and is excreted unchanged entirely in the urine. Based on urinary recovery, the mean extent of absorption of lisinopril is approximately 25 %, with large intersubject variability (6 to 60 %) at all doses tested (5 to 80 mg). Lisinopril absorption is not influenced by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract. </p>
<p>Upon multiple dosing, lisinopril exhibits an effective half-life of accumulation of 12 hours. </p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Impaired renal function</span> decreases elimination of lisinopril, which is excreted principally through the kidneys, but this decrease becomes clinically important only when the glomerular filtration rate is below 30 mL/min. Above this glomerular filtration rate, the elimination half-life is little changed. With greater impairment, however, peak and trough lisinopril levels increase, time to peak concentration increases and time to attain steady state is prolonged. Older patients, on average, have (approximately doubled) higher blood levels and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) than younger patients (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#_8a86ca91-41a7-374b-8f52-de1645d9f73f">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>). In a multiple dose pharmacokinetic study in elderly versus young hypertensive patients using the lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide combination, the AUC increased approximately 120% for lisinopril and approximately 80% for hydrochlorothiazide in older patients. Lisinopril can be removed by hemodialysis. </p>
<p>Studies in rats indicate that lisinopril crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly. Multiple doses of lisinopril in rats do not result in accumulation in any tissues; however, milk of lactating rats contains radioactivity following administration of <span class="Sup">14</span>C lisinopril. By whole body autoradiography, radioactivity was found in the placenta following administration of labeled drug to pregnant rats, but none was found in the fetuses. </p>

<h3><span class="Bold Italics">Pharmacodynamics</span></h3>
<p class="First">Administration of lisinopril to patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> results in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>. Symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span> is usually not observed although it can occur and should be anticipated in volume and/or salt-depleted patients (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#WARNINGS">WARNINGS</a></span>). </p>
<p>In most patients studied, onset of antihypertensive activity was seen at one hour after oral administration of an individual dose of lisinopril, with peak reduction of blood pressure achieved by six hours. </p>
<p>In some patients achievement of optimal blood pressure reduction may require 2 to 4 weeks of therapy. </p>
<p>At recommended single daily doses, antihypertensive effects have been maintained for at least 24 hours, after dosing, although the effect at 24 hours was substantially smaller than the effect 6 hours after dosing. </p>
<p>The antihypertensive effects of lisinopril have continued during long-term therapy. Abrupt withdrawal of lisinopril has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure; nor with a significant overshoot of pretreatment blood pressure. </p>
<p>In hemodynamic studies in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320128" conceptname="Essential hypertension">essential hypertension</span>, blood pressure reduction was accompanied by a reduction in peripheral arterial resistance with little or no change in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span> and in heart rate. In a study in 9 hypertensive patients, following administration of lisinopril, there was an increase in mean renal blood flow that was not significant. Data from several small studies are inconsistent with respect to the effect of lisinopril on glomerular filtration rate in hypertensive patients with normal renal function, but suggest that changes, if any, are not large. </p>
<p>In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317895" conceptname="Renovascular hypertension">renovascular hypertension</span> lisinopril has been shown to be well tolerated and effective in controlling blood pressure (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#PRECAUTIONS">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>). </p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Hydrochlorothiazide</span></h2>
<p class="First">The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown. Thiazides do not usually affect normal blood pressure. </p>
<p>Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic and antihypertensive. It affects the distal renal tubular mechanism of electrolyte reabsorption. Hydrochlorothiazide increases excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Natriuresis may be accompanied by some loss of potassium and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span>. </p>
<p>After oral use <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span> begins within 2 hours, peaks in about 4 hours and lasts about 6 to 12 hours. </p>
<p>Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidney. When plasma levels have been followed for at least 24 hours, the plasma half-life has been observed to vary between 5.6 and 14.8 hours. At least 61% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placental but not the blood-brain barrier.</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">strokes</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarctions</span>. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide.</p>
<p>Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).</p>
<p>Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, but reductions in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.</p>
<p>Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> (for example, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432867" conceptname="Hyperlipidemia">hyperlipidemia</span>), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.</p>
<p>Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (eg, on angina, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.</p>
<p>These fixed-dose combinations are not indicated for initial therapy (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#_8a86ca91-41a7-374b-8f52-de1645d9f73f">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>
<p>In using lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, USP, consideration should be given to the fact that an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440689" conceptname="Agranulocytosis">agranulocytosis</span>, particularly in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> or collagen vascular disease, and that available data are insufficient to show that lisinopril does not have a similar risk (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#WARNINGS">WARNINGS</a></span>). </p>
<p>In considering the use of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, USP, it should be noted that ACE inhibitors have been associated with a higher rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432791" conceptname="Angioedema">angioedema</span> in black than in nonblack patients (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#WARNINGS">WARNINGS</a><a href="#_b5b2d16b-144f-2008-30bf-28f8dc7f8f0f">, Lisinopril</a></span>).<span class="Bold"> </span></p>

When pregnancy is detected, discontinue lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus.</p>
<p>In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment.

<h3><span class="Bold Italics">Lisinopril</span></h3>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> - Patients on Diuretic Therapy</span></p>
<p>Patients on diuretics and especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with lisinopril. The possibility of hypotensive effects with lisinopril can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with lisinopril. If it is necessary to continue the diuretic, initiate therapy with lisinopril at a dose of 5 mg daily, and provide close medical supervision after the initial dose for at least 2 hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#WARNINGS">WARNINGS,</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#_8a86ca91-41a7-374b-8f52-de1645d9f73f">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>). When a diuretic is added to the therapy of a patient receiving lisinopril, an additional antihypertensive effect is usually observed (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#_8a86ca91-41a7-374b-8f52-de1645d9f73f">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>). </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)</span></p>
<p>In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including lisinopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span>. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving lisinopril and NSAID therapy.</p>
<p>The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including lisinopril, may be attenuated by NSAIDs. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin-System (RAS)</span></p>
<p>Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span>, and changes in renal function (including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span>) compared to monotherapy. </p>
<p>The VA NEPHRON trial enrolled 1448 patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, elevated urinary-albumin- to-creatinine ratio, and decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR 30 to 89.9 ml/min), randomized them to lisinopril or placebo on a background of losartan therapy and followed them for a median of 2.2 years. Patients receiving the combination of losartan and lisinopril did not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy for the combined endpoint of decline in GFR, end state <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>, but experienced an increased incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span> and acute kidney injury compared with the monotherapy group.</p>
<p>In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors, closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide and other agents that affect the RAS.</p>
<p>Do not co-administer aliskiren with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>. Avoid use of aliskiren with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (GFR &lt; 60 ml/min). </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Other Agents</span></p>
<p>Lisinopril has been used concomitantly with nitrates and/or digoxin without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions. No meaningful clinically important <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interactions</span> occurred when lisinopril was used concomitantly with propranolol, digoxin, or hydrochlorothiazide. The presence of food in the stomach does not alter the bioavailability of lisinopril. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Agents Increasing Serum Potassium</span></p>
<p>Lisinopril attenuates potassium loss caused by thiazide-type diuretics. Use of lisinopril with potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, spironolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to significant increases in serum potassium. Therefore, if concomitant use of these agents is indicated, because of demonstrated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>, they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Lithium</span></p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">Lithium toxicity</span> has been reported in patients receiving lithium concomitantly with drugs which cause elimination of sodium, including ACE inhibitors. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">Lithium toxicity</span> was usually reversible upon discontinuation of lithium and the ACE inhibitor. It is recommended that serum lithium levels be monitored frequently if lisinopril is administered concomitantly with lithium.</p>

Refer to the package insert for lithium preparations before use of such preparations with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs</span></p>
<p>In some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide is obtained. </p>

<p class="First">Two-year feeding studies in mice and rats conducted under the auspices of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) uncovered no evidence of a carcinogenic potential of hydrochlorothiazide in female mice (at doses of up to approximately 600 mg/kg/day) or in male and female rats (at doses of up to approximately 100 mg/kg/day). These doses are 150 times and 12 times for mice and 25 times and 4 times for rats the maximum human daily dose based on mg/kg and mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, respectively. The NTP, however, found equivocal evidence for hepatocarcinogenicity in male mice. </p>
<p>Hydrochlorothiazide was not genotoxic<span class="Italics"> in vitro</span> in the Ames mutagenicity assay of <span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span> typhimurium</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, TA 1537, and TA 1538 and in the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) test for chromosomal aberrations, or <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> in assays using mouse germinal cell chromosomes, Chinese hamster bone marrow chromosomes, and the <span class="Italics">Drosophila</span> sex-linked recessive lethal trait gene. Positive test results were obtained only in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> CHO Sister Chromatid Exchange (clastogenicity) and in the Mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">Lymphoma</span> Cell (mutagenicity) assays, using concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide from 43 to 1300 mcg/mL, and in the <span class="Italics">Aspergillus nidulans</span> nondisjunction assay at an unspecified concentration. </p>
<p>Hydrochlorothiazide had no adverse effects on the fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies wherein these species were exposed, via their diet, to doses of up to 100 and 4 mg/kg, respectively, prior to conception and throughout gestation. In mice this dose is 25 times and 2 times the maximum daily human dose based on mg/kg and mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, respectively. In rats this dose is 1 times and 0.2 times the maximum daily human dose based on mg/kg and mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, respectively.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">It is not known whether lisinopril is excreted in human milk. However, milk of lactating rats contains radioactivity following administration of 14C lisinopril. In another study, lisinopril was present in rat milk at levels similar to plasma levels in the dams. Thiazides do appear in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from ACE inhibitors and hydrochlorothiazide, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing and/or discontinue lisinopril and/or hydrochlorothiazide, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. </p>

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>

Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> and/or substituting for disordered renal function. Lisinopril, which crosses the placenta, has been removed from neonatal circulation by peritoneal dialysis with some clinical benefit, and theoretically may be removed by exchange transfusion, although there is no experience with the latter procedure.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. </p>
<p>This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection. Evaluation of the hypertensive patient should always include assessment of renal function.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide has been evaluated for safety in 930 patients including 100 patients treated for 50 weeks or more. </p>
<p>In clinical trials with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide no adverse experiences peculiar to this combination drug have been observed. Adverse experiences that have occurred have been limited to those that have been previously reported with lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide.</p>
<p>The most frequent clinical adverse experiences in controlled trials (including open label extensions) with any combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide were: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span> (7.5%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> (5.2%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> (3.9%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span> (3.7%) and orthostatic effects (3.2%) all of which were more common than in placebo-treated patients. Generally, adverse experiences were mild and transient in nature, but see <span class="Bold"><a href="#WARNINGS">WARNINGS</a></span> regarding <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432791" conceptname="Angioedema">angioedema</span> and excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">syncope</span>. Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse effects was required in 4.4% of patients principally because of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75635" conceptname="Cramp">muscle cramps</span>. </p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Lisinopril monotherapy is an effective treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> in once-daily doses of 10 to 80 mg, while hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy is effective in doses of 12.5 to 50 mg per day. In clinical trials of lisinopril / hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using lisinopril doses of 10 to 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 to 50 mg, the antihypertensive response rates generally increased with increasing dose of either component. </p>
<p>The side effects (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#WARNINGS">WARNINGS</a></span>) of lisinopril are generally rare and apparently independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>) and dose-independent phenomena (eg, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192640" conceptname="Pancreatitis">pancreatitis</span>), the former much more common than the latter. Therapy with any combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide may be associated with either or both dose-independent or dose-dependent side effects, but addition of lisinopril in clinical trials blunted the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span> normally seen with diuretics. </p>
<p>To minimize dose-dependent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Dose Titration Guided by Clinical Effect</span></p>
<p>A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with either lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy may be switched to lisinopril/HCTZ 10/12.5 or lisinopril/HCTZ 20/12.5, depending on current monotherapy dose. Further increases of either or both components should depend on clinical response with blood pressure measured at the interdosing interval to ensure that there is an adequate antihypertensive effect at that time. The hydrochlorothiazide dose should generally not be increased until 2 to 3 weeks have elapsed. After addition of the diuretic it may be possible to reduce the dose of lisinopril. Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 25 mg of daily hydrochlorothiazide, but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen may achieve similar or greater blood-pressure control without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022093" conceptname="Electrolyte imbalance">electrolyte disturbance</span> if they are switched to lisinopril/HCTZ 10/12.5. </p>
<p>In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> occasionally may occur following the initial dose of lisinopril. The diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued for two to three days before beginning therapy with lisinopril to reduce the likelihood of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#WARNINGS">WARNINGS</a></span>). If the patient's blood pressure is not controlled with lisinopril alone, diuretic therapy may be resumed. </p>
<p>If the diuretic cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 5 mg of lisinopril should be used under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#WARNINGS">WARNINGS</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#PRECAUTIONS">PRECAUTIONS</a><a href="#_41200fcc-4e3c-092c-3972-303a7a043c05">, Drug Interactions</a></span>).</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes or potassium-sparing diuretics may lead to increases of serum potassium (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#PRECAUTIONS">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>).</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Replacement Therapy</span><span class="Bold"> </span></p>
<p>The combination may be substituted for the titrated individual components.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Use in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal Impairment</span></span></p>
<p>Regimens of therapy with lisinopril/HCTZ need not take account of renal function as long as the patient’s creatinine clearance is &gt;30 mL/min/1.7m<span class="Sup">2</span> (serum creatinine roughly ≤3 mg/dL or 265 mcmol/L). In patients with more severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides, so lisinopril/HCTZ is not recommended (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#WARNINGS">WARNINGS</a>, </span><span class="Italics">Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure</span><span class="Italics">).</span> </p>
