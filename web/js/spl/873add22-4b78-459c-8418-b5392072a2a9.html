<p>Isosorbide dinitrate is a white, crystalline, odorless compound which is stable in air and in solution, has a melting point of 70°C and has an optical rotation of +134° (c=1.0, alcohol, 20°C). Isosorbide dinitrate is freely soluble in organic solvents such as acetone, alcohol, and ether, but is only sparingly soluble in water.</p>
<p>Isosorbide dinitrate tablets are available for oral administration as 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, or 30 mg tablets.</p>
<p>Each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: lactose anhydrous, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate and stearic acid. In addition, the 20 mg tablet contains D&amp;C Yellow #10, FD&amp;C Blue #1, and FD&amp;C Yellow #6; the 30 mg tablet contains FD&amp;C Blue #1.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">The principal pharmacological action of isosorbide dinitrate is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span>, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction, and coronary dilatation remains undefined.</p>
<p>Dosing regimens for most chronically used drugs are designed to provide plasma concentrations that are continuously greater than a minimally effective concentration. This strategy is inappropriate for organic nitrates. Several well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the anti-anginal efficacy of continuously-delivered nitrates. In the large majority of these trials, active agents were no more effective than placebo after 24 hours (or less) of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome nitrate tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in excess of those used acutely, have consistently failed. Only after nitrates have been absent from the body for several hours has their anti-anginal efficacy been restored.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Absorption of isosorbide dinitrate after oral dosing is nearly complete, but bioavailability is highly variable (10% to 90%), with extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver. Serum levels reach their maxima about an hour after ingestion. The average bioavailability of isosorbide dinitrate is about 25%; most studies have observed progressive increases in bioavailability during chronic therapy.</p>
<p>Once absorbed, the volume of distribution of isosorbide dinitrate is 2 to 4 L/kg, and this volume is cleared at the rate of 2 to 4 L/min, so isosorbide dinitrate's half-life in serum is about an hour. Since the clearance exceeds hepatic blood flow, considerable extra hepatic metabolism must also occur. Clearance is affected primarily by denitration to the 2-mononitrate (15 to 25%) and the 5-mononitrate (75 to 85%).</p>
<p>Both metabolites have biological activity, especially the 5-mononitrate. With an overall half-life of about 5 hours, the 5-mononitrate is cleared from the serum by denitration to isosorbide, glucuronidation to the 5-mononitrate glucuronide, and denitration/hydration to sorbitol. The 2-mononitrate has been less well studied, but it appears to participate in the same metabolic pathways, with a half-life of about 2 hours.</p>
<p>The daily dose-free interval sufficient to avoid tolerance to organic nitrates has not been well defined. Studies of nitroglycerin (an organic nitrate with a very short half-life) have shown that daily dose-free intervals of 10 to 12 hours are usually sufficient to minimize tolerance. Daily dose-free intervals that have succeeded in avoiding tolerance during trials of moderate doses (<span class="Italics">e.g.</span>, 30 mg) of immediate-release isosorbide dinitrate have generally been somewhat longer (at least 14 hours), but this is consistent with the longer half-lives of isosorbide dinitrate and its active metabolites.</p>
<p>Few well-controlled clinical trials of organic nitrates have been designed to detect rebound or withdrawal effects. In one such trial, however, subjects receiving nitroglycerin had<span class="Italics">less</span>exercise tolerance at the end of the daily dose-free interval than the parallel group receiving placebo. The incidence, magnitude, and clinical significance of similar phenomena in patients receiving isosorbide dinitrate have not been studied.</p>

<h2>Clinical Trials </h2>
<p class="First">In clinical trials, immediate-release oral isosorbide dinitrate has been administered in a variety of regimens, with total daily doses ranging from 30 mg to 480 mg. Controlled trials of single oral doses of isosorbide dinitrate have demonstrated effective reductions in exercise-related angina for up to 8 hours. Anti-anginal activity is present about 1 hour after dosing.</p>
<p>Most controlled trials of multiple-dose oral isosorbide dinitrate taken every 12 hours (or more frequently) for several weeks have shown statistically significant anti-anginal efficacy for only 2 hours after dosing. Once-daily regimens, and regimens with one daily dose-free interval of at least 14 hours (<span class="Italics">e.g.</span>, a regimen providing doses at 0800, 1400 and 1800 hours), have shown efficacy after the first dose of each day that was similar to that shown in the single-dose studies cited above. The effects of the second and later doses have been smaller and shorter-lasting than the effect of the first.</p>
<p>From large, well-controlled studies of other nitrates, it is reasonable to believe that the maximal achievable daily duration of anti-anginal effect from isosorbide dinitrate is about 12 hours. No dosing regimen for isosorbide dinitrate, however, has ever actually been shown to achieve this duration of effect. One study of 8 patients, who were administered a pretitrated dose (average 27.5 mg) of immediate-release isosorbide dinitrate at 0800, 1300, and 1800 hours for 2 weeks, revealed that significant anti-anginal effectiveness was discontinuous and totaled about 6 hours in a 24 hour period.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Amplification of the vasodilatory effects of isosorbide dinitrate by sildenafil can result in severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>. The time course and dose <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> of this interaction have not been studied.

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">General</span></p>
<p>Severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, particularly with upright posture, may occur with even small doses of isosorbide dinitrate. This drug should therefore be used with caution in patients who may be volume depleted or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> induced by isosorbide dinitrate may be accompanied by paradoxical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span> and increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321318" conceptname="Angina pectoris">angina pectoris</span>.</p>
<p>Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4124693" conceptname="Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy">hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</span>.</p>
<p>As tolerance to isosorbide dinitrate develops, the effect of sublingual nitroglycerin on exercise tolerance, although still observable, is somewhat blunted.</p>
<p>Some clinical trials in angina patients have provided nitroglycerin for about 12 continuous hours of every 24-hour day. During the daily dose-free interval in some of these trials, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321318" conceptname="Angina pectoris">anginal attacks</span> have been more easily provoked than before treatment, and patients have demonstrated hemodynamic rebound and<span class="Italics">decreased</span>exercise tolerance. The importance of these observations to the routine, clinical use of immediate-release oral isosorbide dinitrate is not known.</p>
<p>In industrial workers who have had long-term exposure to unknown (presumably high) doses of organic nitrates, tolerance clearly occurs. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77670" conceptname="Chest pain">Chest pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">acute myocardial infarction</span>, and even <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4132309" conceptname="Sudden death">sudden death</span> have occurred during temporary withdrawal of nitrates from these workers, demonstrating the existence of true physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>.</p>

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Patients should be told that the anti-anginal efficacy of isosorbide dinitrate is strongly related to its dosing regimen, so the prescribed schedule of dosing should be followed carefully. In particular, daily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headaches</span> sometimes accompany treatment with isosorbide dinitrate. In patients who get these <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headaches</span>, the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headaches</span> are a marker of the activity of the drug. Patients should resist the temptation to avoid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headaches</span> by altering the schedule of their treatment with isosorbide dinitrate, since loss of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> may be associated with simultaneous loss of anti-anginal efficacy. Aspirin and/or acetaminophen, on the other hand, often successfully relieve isosorbide dinitrate-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headaches</span> with no deleterious effect on isosorbide dinitrate's anti-anginal efficacy.</p>
<p>Treatment with isosorbide dinitrate may be associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">lightheadedness</span> on standing, especially just after rising from a recumbent or seated position. This effect may be more frequent in patients who have also consumed alcohol.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">The vasodilating effects of isosorbide dinitrate may be additive with those of other vasodilators. Alcohol, in particular, has been found to exhibit additive effects of this variety.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">No long-term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of isosorbide dinitrate. In a modified two-litter reproduction study, there was no remarkable gross pathology and no altered fertility or gestation among rats fed isosorbide dinitrate at 25 or 100 mg/kg/day.</p>

<h2>Pregnancy Category C</h2>
<p class="First">At oral doses 35 and 150 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, isosorbide dinitrate has been shown to cause a dose-related increase in embryotoxicity (increase in mummified pups) in rabbits. There are no adequate, well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Isosorbide dinitrate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of isosorbide dinitrate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Adverse reactions to isosorbide dinitrate are generally dose-related, and almost all of these reactions are the result of isosorbide dinitrate's activity as a vasodilator. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">Headache</span>, which may be severe, is the most commonly reported side effect. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">Headache</span> may be recurrent with each daily dose, especially at higher doses. Transient episodes of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">lightheadedness</span>, occasionally related to blood pressure changes, may also occur. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> occurs infrequently, but in some patients it may be severe enough to warrant discontinuation of therapy. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">Syncope</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315296" conceptname="Preinfarction syndrome">crescendo angina</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221991" conceptname="Rebound hypertension">rebound hypertension</span> have been reported but are uncommon.</p>
<p>Extremely rarely, ordinary doses of organic nitrates have caused <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">methemoglobinemia</span> in normal-seeming patients. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">Methemoglobinemia</span> is so infrequent at these doses that further discussion of its diagnosis and treatment is deferred (see <span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span>).</p>

<h2>Hemodynamic Effects</h2>
<p class="First">The ill effects of isosorbide dinitrate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> are generally the results of isosorbide dinitrate's capacity to induce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4237053" conceptname="Vasodilatation">vasodilatation</span>, venous pooling, reduced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>.

<p>Laboratory determinations of serum levels of isosorbide dinitrate and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of isosorbide dinitrate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>.</p>
<p>There are no data suggesting what dose of isosorbide dinitrate is likely to be life-threatening in humans. In rats, the median acute lethal dose (LD<span class="Sub">50</span>) was found to be 1100 mg/kg.</p>
<p>No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (<span class="Italics">e.g.</span>, maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of isosorbide dinitrate and its active metabolites. Similarly, it is not known which, if any, of these substances can usefully be removed from the body by hemodialysis.</p>
<p>No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of isosorbide dinitrate is known, and no intervention has been subject to controlled studies as a therapy for isosorbide dinitrate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. Because the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> associated with isosorbide dinitrate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> is the result of venodilatation and arterial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436375" conceptname="Hypovolemia">hypovolemia</span>, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. Passive elevation of the patient's legs may be sufficient, but intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary.</p>
<p>The use of epinephrine or other arterial vasoconstrictors in this setting is likely to do more harm than good.</p>
<p>In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>, therapy resulting in central volume expansion is not without hazard. Treatment of isosorbide dinitrate overdosage in these patients may be subtle and difficult, and invasive monitoring may be required.</p>

<p class="First">Nitrate ions liberated during metabolism of isosorbide dinitrate can oxidize hemoglobin into methemoglobin. Even in patients totally without cytochrome b<span class="Sub">5</span>reductase activity, however, and even assuming that the nitrate moieties of isosorbide dinitrate are quantitatively applied to oxidation of hemoglobin, about 1 mg/kg of isosorbide dinitrate should be required before any of these patients manifests clinically significant (≥10%) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">methemoglobinemia</span>. In patients with normal reductase function, significant production of methemoglobin should require even larger doses of isosorbide dinitrate. In one study in which 36 patients received 2 to 4 weeks of continuous nitroglycerin therapy at 3.1 to 4.4 mg/hr (equivalent, in total administered dose of nitrate ions, to 4.8 to 6.9 mg of bioavailable isosorbide dinitrate per hour), the average methemoglobin level measured was 0.2%; this was comparable to that observed in parallel patients who received placebo.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these observations, there are case reports of significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">methemoglobinemia</span> in association with moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> of organic nitrates. None of the affected patients had been thought to be unusually susceptible.</p>
<p>Methemoglobin levels are available from most clinical laboratories. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who exhibit signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span> and adequate arterial pO<span class="Sub">2</span>. Classically, methemoglobinemic blood is described as chocolate brown, without color change on exposure to air.</p>
<p>When <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">methemoglobinemia</span> is diagnosed, the treatment of choice is methylene blue, 1 to 2 mg/kg intravenously.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">As noted under "<span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>," multiple-dose studies with isosorbide dinitrate and other nitrates have shown that maintenance of continuous 24-hour plasma levels results in refractory tolerance. Every dosing regimen for isosorbide dinitrate tablets must provide a daily dose-free interval to minimize the development of this tolerance. With immediate-release isosorbide dinitrate, it appears that one daily dose-free interval must be at least 14 hours long.</p>
<p>As also noted under "<span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>," the effects of the second and later doses have been smaller and shorter-lasting than the effects of the first.</p>
<p>Large controlled studies with other nitrates suggest that no dosing regimen with isosorbide dinitrate tablets should be expected to provide more than about 12 hours of continuous anti-anginal efficacy per day.</p>
<p>As with all titratable drugs, it is important to administer the minimum dose which produces the desired clinical effect. The usual starting dose of isosorbide dinitrate is 5 mg to 20 mg, two or three times daily. For maintenance therapy, 10 mg to 40 mg, two or three times daily is recommended. Some patients may require higher doses. A daily dose-free interval of at least 14 hours is advisable to minimize tolerance. The optimal interval will vary with the individual patient, dose and regimen.</p>
