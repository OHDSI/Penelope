<h2> Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Betapace AF (sotalol hydrochloride) has both beta-adrenoreceptor blocking (Vaughan Williams Class II) and cardiac action potential duration prolongation (Vaughan Williams Class III) antiarrhythmic properties. Betapace AF (sotalol hydrochloride) is a racemic mixture of d- and l-sotalol. Both isomers have similar Class III antiarrhythmic effects, while the l-isomer is responsible for virtually all of the beta-blocking activity. The beta-blocking effect of sotalol is non-cardioselective, half maximal at about 80 mg/day and maximal at doses between 320 and 640 mg/day. Sotalol does not have partial agonist or membrane stabilizing activity. Although significant beta-blockade occurs at oral doses as low as 25 mg, significant Class III effects are seen only at daily doses of 160 mg and above.</p>
<p>In children, a Class III electrophysiological effect can be seen at daily doses of 210 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area (BSA). A reduction of the resting heart rate due to the beta-blocking effect of sotalol is observed at daily doses ≥90 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> in children.</p>

<h2>Electrophysiology</h2>
<p class="First">Sotalol hydrochloride prolongs the plateau phase of the cardiac action potential in the isolated myocyte, as well as in isolated tissue preparations of ventricular or atrial muscle (Class III activity). In intact animals it slows heart rate, decreases AV nodal conduction and increases the refractory periods of atrial and ventricular muscle and conduction tissue. </p>
<p>In man, the Class II (beta-blockade) electrophysiological effects of Betapace AF are manifested by increased sinus cycle length (slowed heart rate), decreased AV nodal conduction and increased AV nodal refractoriness. The Class III electrophysiological effects in man include prolongation of the atrial and ventricular monophasic action potentials, and effective refractory period prolongation of atrial muscle, ventricular muscle, and atrio-ventricular accessory pathways (where present) in both the anterograde and retrograde directions. With oral doses of 160 to 640 mg/day, the surface ECG shows dose-related mean increases of 40-100 msec in QT and 10-40 msec in QT<span class="Sub">c</span>. In a study of patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">atrial fibrillation</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">AFIB</span>)/flutter (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">AFIB</span>/AFL) receiving three different oral doses of Betapace AF given q12h (or q24h in patients with a reduced creatinine clearance), mean increases in QT intervals measured from 12-lead ECGs of 25 msec, 40 msec and 54 msec were found in the 80 mg, 120 mg, and 160 mg dose groups, respectively. (See WARNINGS for description of relationship between QT<span class="Sub">c</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135823" conceptname="Torsades de pointes">Torsade de Pointes</span> type <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span>.) No significant alteration in QRS interval is observed. </p>
<p>In a small study (n=25) of patients with implanted defibrillators treated concurrently with sotalol, the average defibrillatory threshold was 6 joules (range 2-15 joules) compared to a mean of 16 joules for a non-randomized comparative group primarily receiving amiodarone. </p>
<p>In a dose-response trial comparing three dose levels of Betapace AF, 80 mg, 120 mg, and 160 mg with placebo given q12h (or q24h in patients with a reduced renal creatinine clearance) for the prevention of recurrence of symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">atrial fibrillation</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">AFIB</span>)/flutter (AFL), the mean ventricular rate during recurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">AFIB</span>/AFL was 125, 107, 110 and 99 beats/min in the placebo, 80 mg, 120 mg and 160 mg dose groups, respectively (p&lt;0.017 for each sotalol dose group versus placebo). In another placebo controlled trial in which Betapace AF was titrated to a dose between 160 and 320 mg/day in patients with chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">AFIB</span>, the mean ventricular rate during recurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">AFIB</span> was 107 and 84 beats/min in the placebo and Betapace AF groups, respectively (p&lt;0.001). </p>
<p>Twenty-five children in an unblinded, multicenter trial with supraventricular (SVT) and/or ventricular (VT) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachyarrhythmias</span>, aged between 3 days and 12 years (mostly neonates and infants), received an ascending titration regimen with daily doses of 30, 90 and 210 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> with dosing every 8 hours for a total of 9 doses. During steady-state, the respective average increases above baseline of the QT<span class="Sub">c</span> interval, in msec (%), were 2(+1%), 14(+4%) and 29(+7%) msec at the 3 dose levels. The respective mean maximum increases above baseline of the QT<span class="Sub">c</span> interval, in msec (%), were 23(+6%), 36(+9%) and 55(+14%) msec at the 3 dose levels. The steady-state percent increases in the RR interval were 3, 9 and 12%. The smallest children (BSA&lt;0.33m<span class="Sup">2</span>) showed a tendency for larger Class III effects (ΔQT<span class="Sub">c</span>) and an increased frequency of prolongations of the QT<span class="Sub">c</span> interval as compared with the larger children (BSA≥.0.33m<span class="Sup">2</span>). The beta-blocking effects also tended to be greater in the smaller children (BSA&lt;0.33m<span class="Sup">2</span>). Both the Class III and beta-blocking effects of sotalol were linearly related with the plasma concentrations. </p>

Concurrently, systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4231869" conceptname="Stroke volume">stroke volume</span> showed non-significant increases of 25% and 8%, respectively. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure increased significantly from 6.4 mmHg to 11.8 mmHg in the 11 patients who completed the study. One patient was discontinued because of worsening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>. Mean arterial pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> work index did not significantly change. Exercise and isoproterenol induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span> are antagonized by sotalol, and total peripheral resistance increases by a small amount. </p>
<p>In hypertensive patients, sotalol produces significant reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Although sotalol is usually well-tolerated hemodynamically, caution should be exercised in patients with marginal cardiac compensation as deterioration in cardiac performance may occur.

<p class="First">Betapace AF has been studied in patients with symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">AFIB</span>/AFL in two principal studies, one in patients with primarily paroxysmal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">AFIB</span>/AFL, the other in patients with primarily chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">AFIB</span>. </p>
<p>In one study, a U.S. multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-response trial of patients with symptomatic primarily paroxysmal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">AFIB</span>/AFL, three fixed dose levels of Betapace AF (80 mg, 120 mg and 160 mg) twice daily and placebo were compared in 253 patients. In patients with reduced creatinine clearance (40-60 mL/min) the same doses were given once daily.

If the QT interval increased to ≥520 msec (or JT ≥430 msec if QRS &gt;100 msec) the drug was discontinued. The patient population in this trial was 64% male, and the mean age was 62 years. No structural heart disease was present in 43% of the patients. Doses were administered once daily in 20% of the patients because of reduced creatinine clearance. </p>
<p>Betapace AF was shown to prolong the time to the first symptomatic, ECG-documented recurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">AFIB</span>/AFL, as well as to reduce the risk of such recurrence at both 6 and 12 months. The 120 mg dose was more effective than 80 mg, but 160 mg did not appear to have an added benefit. Note that these doses were given twice or once daily, depending on renal function. The results are shown in Figure 1 and Tables 1 and 2.</p>

<h3>Safety in Patients with Structural Heart Disease</h3>
<p class="First">In a multicenter double-blind randomized study reported by D. Julian et al, the effect of sotalol 320 mg once daily was compared with that of placebo in 1456 patients (randomized 3:2, sotalol to placebo) surviving an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">acute myocardial infarction</span> (MI). Treatment was started 5-14 days after <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4206471" conceptname="Infarct">infarction</span>. Patients were followed for 12 months. The mortality rate was 7.3% in the sotalol group and 8.9% in the placebo group, not a statistically significant difference. Although the results do not show evidence of a benefit of sotalol in this population, they do not show an added risk in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">post MI</span> patients receiving sotalol.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">In healthy subjects, the oral bioavailability of sotalol is 90-100%. After oral administration, peak plasma concentrations are reached in 2.5 to 4 hours, and steady-state plasma concentrations are attained within 2-3 days (i.e., after 5-6 doses when administered twice daily). Over the dosage range 160-640 mg/day sotalol displays dose proportionality with respect to plasma concentrations. Distribution occurs to a central (plasma) and to a peripheral compartment, with a mean elimination half-life of 12 hours. Dosing every 12 hours results in trough plasma concentrations which are approximately one-half of those at peak. </p>
<p>Sotalol does not bind to plasma proteins and is not metabolized. Sotalol shows very little intersubject variability in plasma levels. The pharmacokinetics of the d and l enantiomers of sotalol are essentially identical. Sotalol crosses the blood brain barrier poorly. Excretion is predominantly via the kidney in the unchanged form, and therefore lower doses are necessary in conditions of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (see <a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_a3e2292a-9119-4e04-a9c1-9bb5cd19fb1f">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>). Age per se does not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of sotalol, but <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> in geriatric patients can increase the terminal elimination half-life, resulting in increased drug accumulation. The absorption of sotalol was reduced by approximately 20% compared to fasting when it was administered with a standard meal. Since sotalol is not subject to first-pass metabolism, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> show no alteration in clearance of sotalol. </p>
<p>The combined analysis of two unblinded, multicenter trials (a single dose and a multiple dose study) with 59 children, aged between 3 days and 12 years, showed the pharmacokinetics of sotalol to be first order. A daily dose of 30 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> of sotalol was administered in the single dose study and daily doses of 30, 90 and 210 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> were administered q8h in the multi-dose study. After rapid absorption with peak levels occurring on average between 2-3 hours following administration, sotalol was eliminated with a mean half-life of 9.5 hours. Steady-state was reached after 1-2 days. The average peak to trough concentration ratio was 2. BSA was the most important covariate and more relevant than age for the pharmacokinetics of sotalol. The smallest children (BSA &lt;0.33m<span class="Sup">2</span>) exhibited a greater drug exposure (+59%) than the larger children who showed a uniform drug concentration profile. The intersubject variation for oral clearance was 22%.</p>

Because Betapace AF can cause life-threatening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span>, it should be reserved for patients in whom <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">AFIB</span>/AFL is highly symptomatic. Patients with paroxysmal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">AFIB</span> whose <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">AFIB</span>/AFL that is easily reversed (by Valsalva maneuver, for example) should usually not be given Betapace AF (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_warnings_id_7a42cff5-35ba-41e0-af8b-f0408ccce851">WARNINGS</a></span>). </p>
<p>In general, antiarrhythmic therapy for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">AFIB</span>/AFL aims to prolong the time in normal sinus rhythm.

<h2>Use with Drugs that Prolong QT Interval and Antiarrhythmic Agents</h2>
<p class="First">The use of Betapace AF in conjunction with other drugs that prolong the QT interval has not been studied and is not recommended. Such drugs include many antiarrhythmics, some phenothiazines, bepridil, tricyclic antidepressants, and certain oral macrolides. Class I or Class III antiarrhythmic agents should be withheld for at least three half-lives prior to dosing with Betapace AF. In clinical trials, Betapace AF was not administered to patients previously treated with oral amiodarone for &gt;1 month in the previous three months. Class Ia antiarrhythmic drugs, such as disopyramide, quinidine and procainamide and other Class III drugs (e.g., amiodarone) are not recommended as concomitant therapy with Betapace AF because of their potential to prolong refractoriness (see <a href="#i4i_warnings_id_7a42cff5-35ba-41e0-af8b-f0408ccce851">WARNINGS</a>). There is only limited experience with the concomitant use of Class Ib or Ic antiarrhythmics.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">Congestive Heart Failure</span></h2>
<p class="First">Sympathetic stimulation is necessary in supporting circulatory function in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>, and beta-blockade carries the potential hazard of further depressing myocardial contractility and precipitating more severe failure. In patients who have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> controlled by digitalis and/or diuretics, Betapace AF should be administered cautiously. Both digitalis and sotalol slow AV conduction. As with all beta-blockers, caution is advised when initiating therapy in patients with any evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047088" conceptname="Left ventricular systolic dysfunction">left ventricular dysfunction</span>. In a pooled data base of four placebo-controlled <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">AFIB</span>/AFL and PSVT studies, new or worsening CHF occurred during therapy with Betapace AF in 5 (1.2%) of 415 patients. In these studies patients with uncontrolled <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> were excluded (i.e., NYHA Functional Classes III or IV). In other premarketing sotalol studies, new or worsened <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span> (CHF) occurred in 3.3% (n=3257) of patients and led to discontinuation in approximately 1% of patients receiving sotalol. The incidence was higher in patients presenting with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">sustained ventricular tachycardia</span>/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226399" conceptname="Fibrillation">fibrillation</span> (4.6%, n=1363), or a prior history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> (7.3%, n=696). Based on a life-table analysis, the one-year incidence of new or worsened CHF was 3% in patients without a prior history and 10% in patients with a prior history of CHF. NYHA Classification was also closely associated to the incidence of new or worsened <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> while receiving sotalol (1.8% in 1395 Class I patients, 4.9% in 1254 Class II patients and 6.1% in 278 Class III or IV patients). </p>

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Please refer to the patient package insert. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Prior to initiation of </span><span class="Bold">Betapace</span><span class="Bold"> AF therapy, the patient should be advised to read the patient package insert and reread it each time therapy is renewed.

<h3>Medications and Supplements </h3>
<p class="First">Assessment of patients' medication history should include all over-counter, prescription and herbal/natural preparations with emphasis on preparations that may affect the pharmacodynamics of Betapace AF such as other cardiac antiarrhythmic drugs, some phenothiazines, bepridil, tricyclic antidepressants and oral macrolides (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_warnings_id_7a42cff5-35ba-41e0-af8b-f0408ccce851">WARNINGS</a> and <a href="#i4i_section_id_767987a0-8851-4cef-a744-f9533b99c6b8">Use with Drugs that Prolong QT Interval and Antiarrhythmic Agents</a></span>). Patients should be instructed to notify their health care providers of any change in over-the-counter, prescription or supplement use. If a patient is hospitalized or is prescribed a new medication for any condition, the patient must inform the health care provider of ongoing Betapace AF therapy. Patients should also check with their health care provider and/or pharmacist prior to taking a new over-the-counter medicine. </p>

<h2>Drugs undergoing CYP450 metabolism</h2>
<p class="First">Sotalol is primarily eliminated by renal excretion; therefore, drugs that are metabolized by CYP450 are not expected to alter the pharmacokinetics of sotalol. </p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="i4i_section_id_6b8f775a-cf1d-4b78-af2c-9fcfeb14b8d6"></a><a name="section-7.5"></a><p></p>
<h2>Digoxin</h2>
<p class="First">Proarrhythmic events were more common in sotalol treated patients also receiving digoxin; it is not clear whether this represents an interaction or is related to the presence of CHF, a known risk factor for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">proarrhythmia</span>, in the patients receiving digoxin. Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate.

<h2>Calcium blocking drugs</h2>
<p class="First"> Betapace AF should be administered with caution in conjunction with calcium blocking drugs because of possible additive effects on atrioventricular conduction or ventricular function. Additionally, concomitant use of these drugs may have additive effects on blood pressure, possibly leading to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>. </p>

<h2>Catecholamine-depleting agents</h2>
<p class="First"> Concomitant use of catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine and guanethidine, with a beta-blocker may produce an excessive reduction of resting sympathetic nervous tone. Patients treated with Betapace AF plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely monitored for evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> and/or marked <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span> which may produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">syncope</span>. </p>

<h2>Beta-2-receptor stimulants</h2>
<p class="First">Beta-agonists such as salbutamol, terbutaline and isoprenaline may have to be administered in increased dosages when used concomitantly with Betapace AF. </p>

<h2>Other</h2>
<p class="First">No <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interactions</span> were observed with hydrochlorothiazide or warfarin. </p>

<h2>Antacids</h2>
<p class="First">Administration of Betapace AF within 2 hours of antacids containing aluminum oxide and magnesium hydroxide should be avoided because it may result in a reduction in Cmax and AUC of 26% and 20%, respectively and consequently in a 25% reduction in the bradycardic effect at rest. Administration of the antacid two hours after Betapace AF has no effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of sotalol.</p>

<h2>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">The presence of sotalol in the urine may result in falsely elevated levels of urinary metanephrine when measured by fluorimetric or photometric methods. In screening patients suspected of having a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118993" conceptname="Pheochromocytoma">pheochromocytoma</span> and being treated with sotalol, a specific method, such as a high performance liquid chromatographic assay with solid phase extraction (e.g., J. Chromatogr. 385:241, 1987) should be employed in determining levels of catecholamines.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">No evidence of carcinogenic potential was observed in rats during a 24-month study at 137-275 mg/kg/ day (approximately 30 times the maximum recommended human oral dose (MRHD) as mg/kg or 5 times the MRHD as mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) or in mice, during a 24-month study at 4141-7122 mg/kg/day (approximately 450-750 times the MRHD as mg/kg or 36-63 times the MRHD as mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). </p>
<p>Sotalol has not been evaluated in any specific assay of mutagenicity or clastogenicity. </p>
<p>No significant reduction in fertility occurred in rats at oral doses of 1000 mg/kg/ day (approximately 100 times the MRHD as mg/kg or 9 times the MRHD as mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) prior to mating, except for a small reduction in the number of offspring per litter.</p>

<h2>Pregnancy Category B</h2>
<p class="First">Reproduction studies in rats and rabbits during organogenesis at 100 and 22 times the MRHD as mg/kg (9 and 7 times the MRHD as mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>), respectively, did not reveal any teratogenic potential associated with sotalol HCl. In rabbits, a high dose of sotalol HCl (160 mg/kg/day) at 16 times the MRHD as mg/kg (6 times the MRHD as mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) produced a slight increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079844" conceptname="Fetal death">fetal death</span> likely due to maternal toxicity. Eight times the maximum dose (80 mg/kg/day or 3 times the MRHD as mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) did not result in an increased incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079844" conceptname="Fetal death">fetal deaths</span>. In rats, 1000 mg/kg/day sotalol HCl, 100 times the MRHD (18 times the MRHD as mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>), increased the number of early resorptions, while at 14 times the maximum dose (2.5 times the MRHD as mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>), no increase in early resorptions was noted. However, animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. </p>
<p>Although there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, sotalol HCl has been shown to cross the placenta, and is found in amniotic fluid. There has been a report of subnormal birth weight with sotalol. Therefore, Betapace AF should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Sotalol is excreted in the milk of laboratory animals and has been reported to be present in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from Betapace AF, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Betapace AF in children have not been established. However, the Class III electrophysiologic and beta-blocking effects, the pharmacokinetics, and the relationship between the effects (QT<span class="Sub">c</span> interval and resting heart rate) and drug concentrations have been evaluated in children aged between 3 days and 12 years old.

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Adverse events that are clearly related to Betapace AF are those which are typical of its Class II (beta-blocking) and Class III (cardiac action potential duration prolongation) effects. The common documented beta-blocking adverse events (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">dyspnea</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span>) and Class III effects (QT interval prolongation) are dose related. </p>
<p>In a pooled clinical trial population consisting of four placebo-controlled studies with 275 patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">AFIB</span>/AFL treated with 160-320 mg doses of Betapace AF, the following adverse events were reported at a rate of 2% or more in the 160-240 mg treated patients and greater than the rate in placebo patients (See Table 8). The data are presented by incidence of events in the Betapace AF and placebo groups by body system and daily dose. No significant irreversible non-cardiac end-organ toxicity was observed.</p>

<h2>Upward Titration of Dose </h2>
<p class="First">If the 80 mg dose level (given BID or QD depending upon the creatinine clearance) does not reduce the frequency of relapses of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">AFIB</span>/AFL and is tolerated without excessive QT interval prolongation (i.e., ≥520 msec), the dose level may be increased to 120 mg (BID or QD depending upon the creatinine clearance). As proarrhythmic events can occur not only at initiation of therapy, but also with each upward dosage adjustment, Steps 2 through 5 used during initiation of Betapace AF therapy should be followed when increasing the dose level. In the U.S. multicenter dose-response study, the 120 mg dose (BID or QD) was found to be the most effective in prolonging the time to ECG documented symptomatic recurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">AFIB</span>/AFL. If the 120 mg dose does not reduce the frequency of early relapse of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">AFIB</span>/AFL and is tolerated without excessive QT interval prolongation (≥520 msec), an increase to 160 mg (BID or QD depending upon the creatinine clearance), can be considered. Steps 2 through 5 used during the initiation of therapy should be used again to introduce such an increase.</p>

<h2>Maintenance of Betapace AF Therapy </h2>
<p class="First">Renal function and QT should be re-evaluated regularly if medically warranted. If QT is 520 msec or greater (JT 430 msec or greater if QRS is &gt; 100 msec), the dose of Betapace AF therapy should be reduced and patients should be carefully monitored until QT returns to less than 520 msec. If the QT interval is ≥520 msec while on the lowest maintenance dose level (80 mg) the drug should be discontinued. If renal function deteriorates, reduce the daily dose in half by administering the drug once daily as described in <span class="Bold">Initiation of </span><span class="Bold">Betapace</span><span class="Bold"> AF Therapy, Step 3.</span></p>

<h2>Special Considerations </h2>
<p class="First">The maximum recommended dose in patients with a calculated creatinine clearance greater than 60 mL/min is 160 mg BID, doses greater than 160 mg BID have been associated with an increased incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135823" conceptname="Torsades de pointes">Torsade de Pointes</span> and are not recommended. </p>

<h2>Dosing and Administration in Children </h2>
<p class="First">As in adults the following precautionary measures should be considered when initiating sotalol treatment in children: initiation of treatment in the hospital after appropriate clinical assessment; individualized regimen as appropriate; gradual increase of doses if required; careful assessment of therapeutic response and tolerability; and frequent monitoring of the QT<span class="Sub">c</span> interval and heart rate. </p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="i4i_section_id_6c512bcd-2084-4990-ae39-bdb8595c5bef"></a><a name="section-10.6.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>For children aged about 2 years and greater</h3>
<p class="First">For children aged about 2 years and greater, with normal renal function, doses normalized for body surface area are appropriate for both initial and incremental dosing. Since the Class III potency in children (see <a href="#i4i_clinical_pharmacology_id_b28c484a-7435-40cb-b01e-b0209fe223cb">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>) is not very different from that in adults, reaching plasma concentrations that occur within the adult dose range is an appropriate guide. From pediatric pharmacokinetic data the following is recommended. </p>
<p>For initiation of treatment, 30 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> three times a day (90 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> total daily dose) is approximately equivalent to the initial 160 mg total daily dose for adults. Subsequent titration to a maximum of 60 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (approximately equivalent to the 360 mg total daily dose for adults) can then occur. Titration should be guided by clinical response, heart rate and QT<span class="Sub">c</span>, with increased dosing being preferably carried out in-hospital. At least 36 hours should be allowed between dose increments to attain steady-state plasma concentrations of sotalol in patients with age-adjusted normal renal function. </p>
</div>

<a name="i4i_section_id_cc452b23-7be1-4f73-b318-05d1154bb6f4"></a><a name="section-10.6.2"></a><p></p>
<h3>For children aged about 2 years or younger</h3>
<p class="First">For children aged about 2 years or younger, the above pediatric dosage should be reduced by a factor that depends heavily upon age, as shown in the following graph, age plotted on a logarithmic scale in months.</p>
<div class="Figure">
<a name="id1681"></a><img alt="Pediatric Dosage" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=21aea811-f47d-4a44-a552-dfc46d2773bf&amp;name=5c4d8fc9-89c5-4f5c-b78a-168fd34b64c6-04.jpg">
</div>
<p>For a child aged 20 months, the dosing suggested for children with normal renal function aged 2 years or greater should be multiplied by about 0.97; the initial starting dose would be (30 X 0.97)=29.1 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, administered three times daily. For a child aged 1 month, the starting dose should be multiplied by 0.68; the initial starting dose would be (30 X 0.68)=20 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, administered three times daily. For a child aged about 1 week, the initial starting dose should be multiplied by 0.3; the starting dose would be (30 X 0.3)=9 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>. Similar calculations should be made for increased doses as titration proceeds. Since the half-life of sotalol decreases with decreasing age (below about 2 years), time to steady-state will also increase. Thus, in neonates the time to steady-state may be as long as a week or longer.</p>
<p>In all children, individualization of dosage is required. As in adults Betapace AF (sotalol hydrochloride) should be used with particular caution in children if the QT<span class="Sub">c</span> is greater than 500 msec on therapy and serious consideration should be given to reducing the dose or discontinuing therapy when QT<span class="Sub">c</span> exceeds 550 msec.</p>
<p>The use of Betapace AF (sotalol hydrochloride) in children with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> has not been investigated. Sotalol elimination is predominantly via the kidney in the unchanged form. Use of sotalol in any age group with decreased renal function should be at lower doses or at increased intervals between doses. Monitoring of heart rate and QT<span class="Sub">c</span> is more important and it will take much longer to reach steady-state with any dose and/or frequency of administration.</p>

<h3>Transfer to Betapace AF from Betapace </h3>
<p class="First">Patients with a history of symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">AFIB</span>/AFL who are currently receiving Betapace for the maintenance of normal sinus should be transferred to Betapace AF because of the significant differences in labeling (i.e., patient package insert, dosing administration, and safety information).</p>

<h3>Transfer to Betapace AF from Other Antiarrhythmic Agents </h3>
<p class="First">Before starting Betapace AF, previous antiarrhythmic therapy should generally be withdrawn under careful monitoring for a minimum of 2-3 plasma half-lives if the patient's clinical condition permits (see <a href="#i4i_interactions_id_c2755bc2-a9ae-41aa-99ae-b35f107c19a5">Drug Interactions</a>). Treatment has been initiated in some patients receiving I.V. lidocaine without ill effect. After discontinuation of amiodarone, Betapace AF should not be initiated until the QT interval is normalized (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_warnings_id_7a42cff5-35ba-41e0-af8b-f0408ccce851">WARNINGS</a></span>).</p>

<h4><span class="Bold">Preparation of Extemporaneous Oral Solution </span></h4>
<p class="First">Betapace AF Syrup 5 mg/mL can be compounded using Simple Syrup containing 0.1% sodium benzoate (Syrup, NF) available from Humco Laboratories as follows: </p>
<dl>
<dt>1.</dt>
<dd>Measure 120 mL of Simple Syrup </dd>
<dt>2.</dt>
<dd>Transfer the syrup to a 6-ounce amber plastic (polyethylene terephthalate [PET]) prescription bottle. NOTE: An oversized bottle is used to allow for a headspace, so that there will be more effective mixing during <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">shaking</span> of the bottle. </dd>
<dt>3.</dt>
<dd>Add five (5) Betapace AF 120 mg tablets to the bottle. These tablets are added intact; it is not necessary to crush the tablets. NOTE: The addition of the tablets can also be done first. The tablets can also be crushed if preferred. If the tablets are crushed, care should be taken to transfer the entire quantity of tablet powder into the bottle containing the syrup. </dd>
<dt>4.</dt>
<dd>Shake the bottle to wet the entire surface of the tablets. If the tablets have been crushed, shake the bottle until the endpoint is achieved. </dd>
<dt>5.</dt>
<dd>Allow the tablets to hydrate for approximately two hours. </dd>
<dt>6.</dt>
<dd>After at least two hours have elapsed, shake the bottle intermittently over the course of at least another two hours until the tablets are completely disintegrated. NOTE: The tablets can be allowed to hydrate overnight to simplify the disintegration process. </dd>
</dl>
<p>The endpoint is achieved when a dispersion of fine particles in the syrup is obtained. </p>
<p>This compounding procedure results in a solution containing 5 mg/mL of sotalol HCl. The fine solid particles are the water-insoluble inactive ingredients of the tablets. </p>
<p>This extemporaneously prepared oral solution of sotalol HCl (with suspended inactive particles) must be shaken well prior to administration. This is to ensure that the amount of inactive solid particles per dose remains constant throughout the duration of use. </p>
<p>Stability studies indicate that the suspension is stable when stored at controlled room temperature (15°-30°C/59°-86°F) and ambient humidity for three (3) months.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">What is the most important information I should know about </span><span class="Bold">Betapace</span><span class="Bold"> AF?</span></p>
<p>Because you have irregular heartbeats (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">atrial fibrillation</span>) that are troublesome to you, Betapace AF has been prescribed to help your heart to beat in a more normal way. However, in some patients Betapace AF can cause a different type of abnormal heartbeat that can be dangerous, and in rare instances can even cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. You may feel this different type of abnormal heartbeat as a fast beating of the heart with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">lightheadedness</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">fainting</span>. The possibility of this different type of abnormal heartbeat is the reason you and your doctor have discussed whether your symptoms are troublesome enough for you to start taking Betapace AF.</p>
<p>Clinical studies using Betapace AF have shown that the most important way to decrease your chance of getting this different type of dangerous abnormal heartbeat is for you to take the dose of Betapace AF that is right for you. If this abnormal heartbeat occurs, it usually happens during the first few days of treatment. This is why you should be started on Betapace AF in a hospital or another place where your heartbeat can be watched closely by health care professionals for the first few days. They can help you if problems occur. When Betapace AF is started this way, this different type of abnormal heartbeat is rare and the hospital staff is there to treat it.</p>
<p>It is important that when you go home, you take the exact dose the doctor prescribed for you. At any time while you are taking Betapace AF, watch for signs that you may be getting this different type of abnormal heartbeat and call your doctor if they occur. Call your doctor right away if you:</p>
<dl>
<dt>•</dt>
<dd><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">faint</span>, </dd>
<dt>•</dt>
<dd>become dizzy, or </dd>
<dt>•</dt>
<dd>have fast heartbeats.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you cannot reach your doctor, go to the nearest hospital emergency room. Take your Betapace AF tablets with you and show them to the doctor or nurse.</p>
<p>Also, call your doctor right away if you have any of the following conditions: </p>
<dl>
<dt>•</dt>
<dd>severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span></dd>

<dd>more <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4241197" conceptname="Thirst">thirst</span> than normal.</dd>
</dl>
<p>These are conditions that will make you more likely to get the different type of abnormal heartbeat. </p>
<p>If you take Betapace AF with certain other medicines, you will increase your chance of getting this different type of abnormal heartbeat. These medicines are listed below under "<span class="Bold">Who should not take </span><span class="Bold">Betapace</span><span class="Bold"> AF?</span>"</p>
<p>Once your doctor finds the right dose for you, always take that exact amount of Betapace AF. Never take an extra dose and never skip a dose of Betapace AF.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What is </span><span class="Bold">Betapace</span><span class="Bold"> AF?</span></p>
<p>Betapace AF is a medicine that is given to patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">atrial fibrillation</span> (irregular heartbeats). <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">Atrial fibrillation</span> happens when certain parts of the heart (the chambers known as atria) beat too fast or irregularly. When this happens, your heart cannot pump blood through your body as well as it should. This may make you feel weak and tired, or get out of breath easily. You may get an uncomfortable feeling in your chest and "fluttering" or "<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315078" conceptname="Palpitations">palpitations</span>." <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">Atrial fibrillation</span> can be changed back (converted) to normal heart rhythm by an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439396" conceptname="Injury due to electrical exposure">electric shock</span> or by using certain medicines. However, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">atrial fibrillation</span> can return. Betapace AF may help your heart stay beating regularly for a longer period of time. </p>
<p>This information about Betapace AF was developed to ensure that you and your doctor get the right information about your type of irregular heartbeats. Consult your doctor before you accept any other sotalol product that does not provide this patient information.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Who should not take </span><span class="Bold">Betapace</span><span class="Bold"> AF?</span></p>
<p>Betapace AF is not for everyone with irregular heartbeats (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">atrial fibrillation</span>). This is why you and your doctor need to discuss the benefits and risks of Betapace AF and whether your symptoms are troublesome enough for you to start taking Betapace AF. </p>
<p>Do not take Betapace AF if you: </p>
<dl>
<dt>•</dt>

</dl>
<p>Taking certain other medicines with Betapace AF can increase the chance that you will get the dangerous abnormal heartbeat discussed in "<span class="Bold">What is the most important information I should know about </span><span class="Bold">Betapace</span><span class="Bold"> AF?</span>" These include medicines used to treat abnormal heart rhythms and some other heart problems as well as medicines used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and other mental problems, night-time <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="23325" conceptname="Heartburn">heartburn</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span>. Therefore, you should be sure to tell your health care provider about all prescription and non-prescription medicines you are taking, as well as vitamins, dietary supplements, and any natural or herbal remedies. In addition, tell your doctor about any problems you have with your heart or kidneys.</p>
<p>If you are pregnant, you should know that there is no information about the safety of Betapace AF in pregnant women. Some reports indicate that Betapace AF is passed into the breast milk. Women who are taking Betapace AF should not breast feed a child.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">How should I take </span><span class="Bold">Betapace</span><span class="Bold"> AF?</span></p>
<p>Your doctor will start you on Betapace AF in the hospital and will check your heart rhythm for the first 2 or more days of treatment. This will allow your doctor to find the right dose for you. Always take the exact amount your doctor prescribes. Never change your Betapace AF dose unless your doctor tells you to. Your doctor will do regular tests to check that the amount you're taking is still right for you. </p>
<p>Keep taking your Betapace AF until your doctor tells you to stop. Keep taking it even if you feel fine. However, never take an extra dose of Betapace AF even if you do not feel well. When it is time to stop taking Betapace AF, your doctor will give you instructions on how to gradually reduce your dose over a period of 1 to 2 weeks. </p>
<p>You may take Betapace AF with or without food. However, it is important to take Betapace AF at the same time every day. This gives your heart a steady supply of the medicine. It might be helpful to take Betapace AF at the same time as something you regularly do every day. </p>
<p>If you are taking an antacid containing aluminum or magnesium to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="23325" conceptname="Heartburn">heartburn</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012224" conceptname="Upset stomach">upset stomach</span> wait at least 2 hours after your dose of Betapace AF before you take the antacid. </p>
<p>Never try to make up for a missed dose of Betapace AF. You could increase your chance of getting the different type of abnormal heartbeat. If you miss taking a dose of Betapace AF, just take your normal amount at the next scheduled time. </p>
<p>If you take more Betapace AF than you should have, call your doctor right away. If you cannot reach your doctor, go to the nearest hospital emergency room. Take your Betapace AF tablets with you to show to the doctor or nurse.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What should I avoid while taking </span><span class="Bold">Betapace</span><span class="Bold"> AF?</span></p>
<p>Certain other medicines taken with Betapace AF may increase the chance that you will get the dangerous abnormal heartbeat (see <span class="Bold">"Who should not take </span><span class="Bold">Betapace</span><span class="Bold"> AF?"</span>). Do not take Betapace AF with these medicines. Before you start taking Betapace AF tell your doctor about all prescription and non-prescription medicines you are taking (see also <span class="Bold">"Who should not take </span><span class="Bold">Betapace</span><span class="Bold"> AF?"</span>). Once you begin taking Betapace AF, do not start taking any new medicines until you check with your doctor. </p>
<p>Carry a list of all the medicines and supplements you take. If you have to go to the hospital or are treated by new or different health care providers, tell them you are taking Betapace AF and show them the list of other medicines you take. They need this information to make sure your medicines are safe to take at the same time. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or dentist you are taking Betapace AF before you have an operation or dental surgery. Betapace AF can affect how well some anesthetics work.</p>
