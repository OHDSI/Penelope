<h1>Description</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Ampul<br>Fliptop Vial<br>Protect from light.<br>Rx Only</span></p>Nalbuphine hydrochloride is a synthetic opioid agonist-antagonist analgesic of the phenanthrene series. It is chemically related to both the widely used opioid antagonist, naloxone, and the potent opioid analgesic, oxymorphone. Chemically nalbuphine hydrochloride is 17-(cyclobutylmethyl)-4,5a-epoxymorphinan-3,6a,14-triol hydrochloride. Nalbuphine hydrochloride molecular weight is 393.91 and is soluble in H2O (35.5 mg/mL at 25ºC) and ethanol (0.8%); insoluble in CHCl3 and ether. Nalbuphine hydrochloride has pKa values of 8.71 and 9.96. The molecular formula is C21H27NO4 • HCl. The structural formula is:<br><br><div class="Figure"><img alt="Formula1" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=08290748-39dc-4f89-b582-b7eb8b482a2e&amp;name=Formula1.jpg"></div>

<h1>Clinical Pharmacology</h1>
<p class="First">Nalbuphine hydrochloride is a potent analgesic. Its analgesic potency is essentially equivalent to that of morphine on a milligram basis. Receptor studies show that nalbuphine hydrochloride binds to mu, kappa, and delta receptors, but not to sigma receptors. Nalbuphine hydrochloride is primarily a kappa agonist/partial mu antagonist analgesic. The onset of action of nalbuphine hydrochloride occurs within 2 to 3 minutes after intravenous administration, and in less than 15 minutes following subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. The plasma half-life of nalbuphine is 5 hours, and in clinical studies, the duration of analgesic activity has been reported to range from 3 to 6 hours. The opioid antagonist activity of nalbuphine is one-fourth as potent as nalorphine and 10 times that of pentazocine. Nalbuphine hydrochloride may produce the same degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> as equianalgesic doses of morphine. However, nalbuphine hydrochloride exhibits a ceiling effect such that increases in dose greater than 30 mg do not produce further <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> in the absence of other CNS active medications affecting respiration. Nalbuphine hydrochloride by itself has potent opioid antagonist activity at doses equal to or lower than its analgesic dose. When administered following or concurrent with mu agonist opioid analgesics (e.g., morphine, oxymorphone, fentanyl), nalbuphine hydrochloride may partially reverse or block opioid-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> from the mu agonist analgesic. Nalbuphine hydrochloride may precipitate withdrawal in patients dependent on opioid drugs. Nalbuphine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients who have been receiving mu opioid analgesics on a regular basis.<br></p>

<h1>Warnings</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Nalbuphine hydrochloride injection should be administered as a supplement to general anesthesia only by persons specifically trained in the use of intravenous anesthetics and management of respiratory effects of potent opioids.<br>Naloxone hydrochloride injection, resuscitative and intubation equipment and oxygen should be readily available.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><br><span class="Bold">Drug Abuse</span><br>Caution should be observed in prescribing nalbuphine for emotionally unstable patients, or for individuals with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436954" conceptname="Drug abuse">opioid abuse</span>. Such patients should be closely supervised when long term therapy is contemplated (See <span class="Bold">DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span>)</span>.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Use in Ambulatory Patients</span><br>Nalbuphine may impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery. Therefore, nalbuphine hydrochloride injection should be administered with caution to ambulatory patients who should be warned to avoid such hazards.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Use in Emergency Procedures</span><br>Maintain patient under observation until recovered from nalbuphine effects that would affect driving or other potentially dangerous tasks.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Use in Pregnancy (Other Than Labor)</span><br>Severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314749" conceptname="Fetal bradycardia">fetal bradycardia</span> has been reported when nalbuphine is administered during labor. Naloxone may reverse these effects. Although there are no reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314749" conceptname="Fetal bradycardia">fetal bradycardia</span> earlier in pregnancy, it is possible that this may occur. This drug should be used in pregnancy only if clearly needed, if the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus, and if appropriate measures such as fetal monitoring are taken to detect and manage any potential adverse effect on the fetus.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Use During Labor and Delivery</span><br>The placental transfer of nalbuphine is high, rapid, and variable with a maternal to fetal ratio ranging from 1:0.37 to 1:6. Fetal and neonatal adverse effects that have been reported following the administration of nalbuphine to the mother during labor include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314749" conceptname="Fetal bradycardia">fetal bradycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> at birth, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438555" conceptname="Cyanosis">cyanosis</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">hypotonia</span>. Some of these events have been life-threatening. Maternal administration of naloxone during labor has normalized these effects in some cases. Severe and prolonged <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314749" conceptname="Fetal bradycardia">fetal bradycardia</span> has been reported. Permanent neurological damage attributed to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314749" conceptname="Fetal bradycardia">fetal bradycardia</span> has occurred. A sinusoidal fetal heart rate pattern associated with the use of nalbuphine has also been reported. Nalbuphine should be used during labor and delivery only if clearly indicated and only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the infant. Newborns should be monitored for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span> if nalbuphine has been used.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375415" conceptname="Injury of head">Head Injury</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154803" conceptname="Raised intracranial pressure">Increased Intracranial Pressure</span></span><br>The possible respiratory depressant effects and the potential of potent analgesics to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure (resulting from vasodilation following CO2 retention) may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375415" conceptname="Injury of head">head injury</span>, intracranial lesions or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure. Furthermore, potent analgesics can produce effects which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries. Therefore, nalbuphine hydrochloride injection should be used in these circumstances only when essential, and then should be administered with extreme caution.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Interaction With Other Central Nervous System Depressants</span><br>Although nalbuphine possesses opioid antagonist activity, there is evidence that in nondependent patients it will not antagonize an opioid analgesic administered just before, concurrently, or just after an injection of nalbuphine hydrochloride. Therefore, patients receiving an opioid analgesic, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, or other tranquilizers, sedatives, hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with nalbuphine may exhibit an additive effect. When such combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced.</p>

<h1>Precautions</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">General</span></p>
<p><br>Impaired Respiration: At the usual adult dose of 10 mg/70 kg, nalbuphine hydrochloride causes some <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> approximately equal to that produced by equal doses of morphine. However, in contrast to morphine, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> is not appreciably increased with higher doses of nalbuphine. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">Respiratory depression</span> induced by nalbuphine can be reversed by naloxone hydrochloride when indicated. Nalbuphine hydrochloride injection should be administered with caution at low doses to patients with impaired respiration (e.g., from other medication, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4261202" conceptname="Uremia">uremia</span>, bronchial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>, severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438555" conceptname="Cyanosis">cyanosis</span> or respiratory obstructions). Impaired Renal or Hepatic Function: Because nalbuphine is metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys, nalbuphine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with renal or liver dysfunction and administered in reduced amounts. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">Myocardial Infarction</span>: As with all potent analgesics, nalbuphine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> who have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>. Biliary Tract Surgery: As with all opioid analgesics, nalbuphine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients about to undergo surgery of the biliary tract since it may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Cardiovascular System: During evaluation of nalbuphine hydrochloride injection, in anesthesia, a higher incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span> has been reported in patients who did not receive atropine pre-operatively.<br></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Information for Patients</span><br>Patients should be advised of the following information:<br>    • Nalbuphine is associated with sedation and may impair mental and physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks such as driving a car or operating                 machinery.</p>
<p>    • Nalbuphine is to be used as prescribed by a physician. Dose or frequency should not be increased without first consulting with a physician since nalbuphine may cause psychological or     physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>.</p>
<p>    • The use of nalbuphine with other opioids can cause signs and symptoms of withdrawal.</p>
<p>    • Abrupt discontinuation of nalbuphine after prolonged usage may cause signs and symptoms of withdrawal.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Laboratory Tests</span><br>Nalbuphine hydrochloride may interfere with enzymatic methods for the detection of opioids depending on the specificity/sensitivity of the test. Consult the test manufacturer for specific details.<br><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</span><br><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span>: Long term carcinogenicity studies were performed in rats (24 months) and mice (19 months) by oral administration at doses up to 200 mg/kg (1180 mg/m2) and 200 mg/kg (600 mg/m2) per day, respectively. There was no evidence of an increase in tumors in either species related to nalbuphine hydrochloride administration. The maximum recommend human dose (MRHD) in a day is 160 mg subcutaneously, intramuscularly or intravenously, or approximately 100 mg/m2/day for a 60 kg subject.<br><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span>: Nalbuphine hydrochloride did not have mutagenic activity in the AMES test with four bacterial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span>, in the Chinese Hamster Ovary HGPRT assays or in the Sister Chromatids Exchange Assay. However, nalbuphine hydrochloride induced an increased frequency of mutation in the mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> assay. Clastogenic activity was not observed in the mouse micronucleus test of the cytogenicity bone marrow assay in rats.<br><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span>: A reproduction study was performed in male and female rats at subcutaneous doses up to 56 mg/kg/day or 330 mg/m2/day. Nalbuphine hydrochloride did not affect either male or female fertility rats.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Usage in Pregnancy</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Teratogenic Effects:</span><br><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category B</span>: Reproduction studies have been performed in rats by subcutaneous administration of nalbuphine up to 100 mg/kg/day, or 590 mg/m2/day which is approximately 6 times the MRHD, and in rabbits by intravenous administration of nalbuphine up to 32 mg/kg/day, or 378 mg/m2/day which is approximately 4 times the MRHD. The results did not reveal evidence of developmental toxicity, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span>, or harm to the fetus. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Non-teratogenic Effects:</span><br>Neonatal body weight and survival rates were reduced at birth and during lactation when nalbuphine was subcutaneously administered to female and male rats prior to mating and throughout gestation and lactation or to pregnant rats during the last third of gestation and throughout lactation at doses approximately 4 times the maximum recommended human dose.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Use During Labor and Delivery</span><br>See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers</span><br>Limited data suggest that nalbuphine hydrochloride is excreted in maternal milk but only in a small amount (less than 1% of the administered dose) and with a clinically insignificant effect. Caution should be exercised when nalbuphine hydrochloride is administered to a nursing woman.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use</span><br>Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established.</p>

<h1>Drug Abuse and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">Dependence</span></h1>
<p class="First">There have been reports of abuse and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> associated with nalbuphine hydrochloride among health care providers, patients and bodybuilders. There have been reported instances of psychological and physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> and tolerance in patients abusing nalbuphine hydrochloride. Individuals with a prior history of opioid or other <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4279309" conceptname="Substance abuse">substance abuse</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> may be at greater risk in responding to reinforcing properties of nalbuphine hydrochloride. Abrupt discontinuation of nalbuphine hydrochloride following prolonged use has been followed by symptoms of opioid withdrawal, i.e., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal cramps</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4170297" conceptname="Sniffles">rhinorrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435553" conceptname="Epiphora">lacrimation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">restlessness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, elevated temperature and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224957" conceptname="Piloerection">piloerection</span>.</p>

<h1>Overdosage</h1>
<p class="First">The immediate intravenous administration of an opiate antagonist such as naloxone or nalmefene is a specific antidote. Oxygen, intravenous fluids, vasopressors and other supportive measures should be used as indicated. The administration of single doses of 72 mg of nalbuphine hydrochloride subcutaneously to eight normal subjects has been reported to have resulted primarily in symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> and mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4148767" conceptname="Dysphoric mood">dysphoria</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34068-7">
<a name="section-10"></a><p></p>
<h1>Dosage and Administration</h1>
<p class="First">The usual recommended adult dose is 10 mg for a 70 kg individual administered subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously; this dose may be repeated every 3 to 6 hours as necessary. Dosage should be adjusted according to the severity of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, physical status of the patient, and other medications which the patient may be receiving (see<span class="Bold"> Interaction With Other Central Nervous System Depressants</span> under <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>). In nontolerant individuals, the recommended single maximum dose is 20 mg with a maximum total daily dose of 160 mg. The use of nalbuphine hydrochloride injection as a supplement to balanced anesthesia requires larger doses than those recommended for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>. Induction doses of nalbuphine hydrochloride range from 0.3 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg intravenously to be administered over a 10 to 15 minute period with maintenance doses of 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg in single intravenous administrations as required. The use<br>of nalbuphine hydrochloride injection may be followed by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> which can be reversed with the opioid antagonist naloxone hydrochloride.<br><span class="Bold">Patients Dependent on Opioids:</span> Patients who have been taking opioids chronically may experience withdrawal symptoms upon the administration of nalbuphine hydrochloride injection. If unduly troublesome, opioid withdrawal symptoms can be controlled by the slow intravenous administration of small increments of morphine, until relief occurs. If the previous analgesic was<br>morphine, meperidine, codeine, or other opioid with similar duration of activity, one-fourth of the anticipated dose of nalbuphine hydrochloride can be administered initially and the patient observed for signs of withdrawal, i.e., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal cramps</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435553" conceptname="Epiphora">lacrimation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4170297" conceptname="Sniffles">rhinorrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">restlessness</span>, elevation of temperature or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224957" conceptname="Piloerection">piloerection</span>. If untoward symptoms do not<br>occur, progressively larger doses may be tried at appropriate intervals until the desired level of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> is obtained with nalbuphine hydrochloride. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.</p>
