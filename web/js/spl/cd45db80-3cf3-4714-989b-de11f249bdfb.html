<h1>SUICIDALITY AND ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUGS</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of tranylcypromine sulfate or any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. Tranylcypromine sulfate is not approved for use in pediatric patients.

<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Chemically, tranylcypromine sulfate is (Â±)-<span class="Italics">trans</span>-2-phenylcyclopropylamine sulfate (2:1).</p>
<p>Each round, dark pink, film-coated tablet is debossed with â€œ250â€? on one side and â€œKâ€? on the other side and contains tranylcypromine sulfate equivalent to 10 mg of tranylcypromine. Inactive ingredients consist of colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, dibasic calcium phosphate anhydrous, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, talc, and Opadry<span class="Sup">Â®</span> II pink 85F14289.  Opadry pink is used for purposes of coating and contains the following: FD&amp;C Red # 40, polyethylene glycol 3350, polyvinyl alcohol, talc, and titanium dioxide.</p>

<h1>ACTION</h1>
<p class="First">Tranylcypromine is a non-hydrazine monoamine oxidase inhibitor with a rapid onset of activity. It increases the concentration of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and serotonin in storage sites throughout the nervous system and, in theory, this increased concentration of monoamines in the brain stem is the basis for its antidepressant activity. When tranylcypromine is withdrawn, monoamine oxidase activity is recovered in 3 to 5 days, although the drug is excreted in 24 hours.</p>

Therefore, SSRIâ€™s and SNRI should not be used in combination with an MAOI, or within 14 days of discontinuing therapy with an MAOI. </p>
<p>Since fluoxetine and its major metabolite have very long elimination half-lives, at least 5 weeks should be allowed after stopping fluoxetine before starting an MAOI.</p>
<p>At least 2 weeks should be allowed after stopping sertraline (ZoloftÂ®, Pfizer) or paroxetine (PaxilÂ®, GlaxoSmithKline) before starting an MAOI.</p>

<h3><span class="Italics">10. In combination with cheese or other foods with a high tyramine content </span></h3>
<p class="First">When excessive amounts of tyramine are consumed in conjunction with tranylcypromine, or within 2 weeks of stopping treatment, a serious and sometimes fatal hypertensive reaction may occur. </p>
<p>Tyramine occurs naturally in some foods or may occur from the bacterial breakdown of protein in foods which are fermented, aged, or spoiled. Foods that have reliably been shown to contain a high tyramine content and may also have been reported to induce a serious hypertensive reaction when consumed with tranylcypromine are: </p>
<dl>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>all matured or aged cheeses (note: all cheeses are considered matured or aged except fresh cottage cheese, cream cheese, ricotta, and processed cheese. All non-cheese dairy products can be consumed providing they are fresh) </dd>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>all aged, cured or fermented meat, fish, or poultry (note: meat, fish, or poultry that has not undergone aging, curing or fermenting and that is bought fresh, stored correctly and eaten fresh is not contraindicated) </dd>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>all fermented soybean products (e.g., soy sauce, miso, fermented tofu) </dd>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>sauerkraut </dd>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>fava or broad bean pods </dd>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>banana peel (but not the pulp) </dd>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>concentrated yeast extracts (e.g., Marmite or Vegemite spread) </dd>
<dt>â€¢</dt>
<dd>all tap/draught beers (note: some bottled beers, including non-alcoholic beer, may also pose a risk). <br>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Patients should be advised to minimize or avoid use of all alcoholic beverages while taking Tranylcypromine sulfate. Patients should be advised to adhere to the following dietary guidance about eating fresh foods: </p>
<p>Foods may be deliberately aged as part of their processing and these are contraindicated (see list above). Foods may also naturally age over time, even if they are refrigerated. It is therefore extremely important that patients are instructed to buy and eat only fresh foods or those which have been properly frozen. They should avoid eating foods if they are unsure of their storage conditions or freshness and they should be cautious of foods of unknown age or composition even if refrigerated. </p>
<p>The longer food is left to deteriorate and the larger the quantity of food eaten, the greater the potential quantity of tyramine ingested. Where there is any doubt, patients should be advised to either avoid the food or consume it in strict moderation if it is not otherwise contraindicated. </p>
<p>Patients should also be warned that tyramine levels may vary by brand or even batch and a person may absorb different amounts of tyramine from a particular food at different times. Therefore, if they have accidentally consumed a prohibited food on one occasion and not had a reaction, this does not mean that they will not have a serious hypertensive reaction if they consume the same food on a different occasion. </p>

<p class="First">Patients with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and/or the emergence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4092095" conceptname="Planning suicide">suicidal ideation</span> and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> is a known risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. </p>
<p>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440374" conceptname="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">obsessive compulsive disorder</span> (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1,000 patients treated) are provided in <span class="Bold">Table 1</span>. </p>

<p>The usual precautions should be observed in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> since there is a possibility of cumulative effects in such patients.</p>
<p>Older patients may suffer more morbidity than younger patients during and following an episode of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440285" conceptname="Malignant hyperthermia">malignant hyperthermia</span>. Older patients have less compensatory reserve to cope with any serious adverse reaction. Therefore, tranylcypromine sulfate should be used with caution in the elderly population.</p>
<p>Although excretion of tranylcypromine sulfate is rapid, inhibition of MAO may persist up to 10 days following discontinuation.</p>
<p>Because the influence of tranylcypromine sulfate on the convulsive threshold is variable in animal experiments, suitable precautions should be taken if epileptic patients are treated.</p>
<p>Some MAO inhibitors have contributed to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemic episodes</span> in diabetic patients receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Therefore, tranylcypromine sulfate should be used with caution in diabetics using these drugs.</p>
<p>Tranylcypromine sulfate may aggravate coexisting symptoms in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>.</p>
<p>Use tranylcypromine sulfate with caution in hyperthyroid patients because of their increased sensitivity to pressor amines.</p>
<p>Tranylcypromine sulfate should be administered with caution to patients receiving Antabuse<span class="Sup">Â®â€ </span>.  In a single study, rats given high intraperitoneal doses of <span class="Italics">d </span>or<span class="Italics"> l</span> isomers of tranylcypromine sulfate plus disulfiram experienced severe toxicity including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. Additional studies in rats given high oral doses of racemic tranylcypromine sulfate and disulfiram produced no adverse interaction.</p>

<h2>Information for Patients:</h2>
<p class="First">Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with tranylcypromine sulfate and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about â€œAntidepressant Medicines, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> and Other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actionsâ€? is available for tranylcypromine sulfate. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. </p>
<p>Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking tranylcypromine sulfate.</p>

Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication. </p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Dosage should be adjusted to the requirements of the individual patient. Improvement should be seen within 48 hours to 3 weeks after starting therapy.</p>
<p>The usual effective dosage is 30 mg per day, usually given in divided doses. If there are no signs of improvement after a reasonable period (up to 2 weeks), then the dosage may be increased in 10 mg per day increments at intervals of 1 to 3 weeks; the dosage range may be extended to a maximum of 60 mg per day from the usual 30 mg per day.</p>

<p class="First">The characteristic symptoms that may be caused by overdosage are usually those described above.</p>
<p>However, an intensification of these symptoms and sometimes severe additional manifestations may be seen, depending on the degree of overdosage and on individual susceptibility. Some patients exhibit <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">restlessness</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, progressing in severe cases to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">mental confusion</span>, and incoherence. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">weakness</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> may occur, progressing in severe cases to extreme <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span>.

<h2>Treatment:</h2>
<p class="First">Because strategies for the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> are continually evolving, it is advisable to contact a Poison Control Center to determine the latest recommendations for the management of an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> of any drug. Telephone numbers for the certified Poison Control Centers are listed in the <span class="Italics">Physiciansâ€™ Desk Reference</span> (PDR). </p>
<p>Treatment should normally consist of general supportive measures, close observation of vital signs and steps to counteract specific symptoms as they occur, since MAO inhibition may persist. The management of hypertensive crises is described under <a href="#inv-da5085ed-957e-4f5b-9786-93687e5e0bf2">WARNINGS</a> in the <a href="#ID_d991c255-0b5d-4fe7-891c-8c2faa01df69"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312938" conceptname="Hypertensive encephalopathy">Hypertensive Crisis</span>:</a> section.</p>
<p>External cooling is recommended if <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260205" conceptname="Hyperpyrexia">hyperpyrexia</span> occurs. Barbiturates have been reported to help relieve myoclonic reactions, but frequency of administration should be controlled carefully because tranylcypromine sulfate may prolong barbiturate activity. When <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> requires treatment, the standard measures for managing circulatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span> should be initiated. If pressor agents are used, the rate of infusion should be regulated by careful observation of the patient because an exaggerated pressor response sometimes occurs in the presence of MAO inhibition. Remember that the toxic effect of tranylcypromine sulfate may be delayed or prolonged following the last dose of the drug. Therefore, the patient should be closely observed for at least a week. It is not known if tranylcypromine is dialyzable.</p>
