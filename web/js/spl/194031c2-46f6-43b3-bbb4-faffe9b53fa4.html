<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">Mefenamic acid is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities in animal models. The mechanism of action of mefenamic acid, likeÂ that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but may be related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="Section_2.2"></a><a name="section-2.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption: </span>Mefenamic acid is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. In two 500 mg single oral dose studies, the mean extent of absorption was 30.5 mcg/hr/mL (17% CV).<span class="Sup">1</span><span class="Sup">,2</span> The bioavailability of the capsule relative to an IV dose or an oral solution has not been studied.</p>
<p>Following a single 1 gram oral dose, mean peak plasma levels ranging from 10 to 20 mcg/mL<span class="Sup">3</span> have been reported. Peak plasma levels are attained in 2 to 4 hours and the elimination half-life approximates 2 hours. Following multiple doses, plasma levels are proportional to dose with no evidence of drug accumulation. In a multiple dose trial of normal adult subjects (n=6) receiving 1 gram doses of mefenamic acid four times daily, steady-state concentrations of 20 mcg/mL were reached on the second day of administration, consistent with the short half-life.</p>
<p>The effect of food on the rate and extent of absorption of mefenamic acid has not been studied. Concomitant ingestion of antacids containing magnesium hydroxide has been shown to significantly increase the rate and extent of mefenamic acid absorption (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_6">PRECAUTIONS</a>, <a href="#Section_6.4">Drug Interactions</a></span>).<span class="Sup">1</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Distribution: </span>Mefenamic acid has been reported as being greater than 90% bound to albumin.<span class="Sup">9</span> The relationship of unbound fraction to drug concentration has not been studied. The apparent volume of distribution (Vz<span class="Sub">ss</span>/F) estimated following a 500 mg oral dose of mefenamic acid was 1.06 L/kg.<span class="Sup">2</span></p>
<p>Based on its physical and chemical properties, mefenamic acid is expected to be excreted in human breast milk.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Metabolism: </span>Mefenamic acid is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 to 3-hydroxymethyl mefenamic acid (Metabolite I). Further oxidation to a 3-carboxymefenamic acid (Metabolite II) may occur.<span class="Sup">10</span> The activity of these metabolites has not been studied. The metabolites may undergo glucuronidation and mefenamic acid is also glucuronidated directly. A peak plasma level approximating 20 mcg/mL was observed at 3 hours for the hydroxy metabolite and its glucuronide (n=6) after a single 1 gram dose. Similarly, a peak plasma level of 8 mcg/mL was observed at 6 to 8 hours for the carboxy metabolite and its glucuronide.<span class="Sup">3</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Excretion: </span>Approximately fifty-two percent of a mefenamic acid dose is excreted into the urine primarily as glucuronides of mefenamic acid (6%), 3-hydroxymefenamic acid (25%) and 3-carboxymefenamic acid (21%). The fecal route of elimination accounts for up to 20% of the dose, mainly in the form of unconjugated 3-carboxymefenamic acid.<span class="Sup">3</span></p>
<p>The elimination half-life of mefenamic acid is approximately two hours. Half-lives of metabolites I and II have not been precisely reported, but appear to be longer than the parent compound.<span class="Sup">3</span> The metabolites may accumulate in patients with renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic failure</span>. The mefenamic acid glucuronide may bind irreversibly to plasma proteins. Because both renal and hepatic excretion are significant pathways of elimination, dosage adjustments in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction may be necessary. Mefenamic acid should not be administered to patients with preexisting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span> or in patients with significantly <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>.</p>

<h2>Special Populations</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric:</span> Mefenamic acid has not been adequately investigated in pediatric patients less than 14 years of age.

<h2>CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</span><br></p>
<p>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, which can be fatal.Â  All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk.Â  Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk.Â  To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible.Â  Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms.Â  Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</p>
<p>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI events (seeÂ <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_5.1.4">GI WARNINGS</a></span>). </p>

<h2>Gastrointestinal Effects - Risk of Ulceration, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">Bleeding</span>, and Perforation</h2>
<p class="First">NSAIDs, including mefenamic acid, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcers</span>, gross <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2 to 4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk.</p>
<p>NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcer</span> disease or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">gastrointestinal bleeding</span>. Patients with a prior history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4027663" conceptname="Peptic ulcer">peptic ulcer disease</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">gastrointestinal bleeding</span> who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">GI bleed</span> compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.</p>
<p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">A number of compounds are inhibitors of CYP2C9.Â  Drug interactions studies of mefenamic acid and these compounds have not been conducted. The possibility of altered safety and efficacy should be considered when mefenamic acidÂ  is used concomitantly with these drugs. </p>
<p>ACE-inhibitors</p>
<p>Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors.Â  This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors. </p>
<p>Aspirin</p>
<p>When mefenamic acid is administered with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free mefenamic acid is not altered.Â  The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of mefenamic acid and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.</p>
<p>Diuretics</p>
<p>Clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations, have shown that mefenamic acid can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients.Â  This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.Â  During concomitant therapy of NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_5.1.5">PRECAUTIONS, Renal Effects</a></span>), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.</p>
<p>Lithium</p>
<p>NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance.Â  The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437992" conceptname="Renal function tests abnormal">renal clearance decreased</span> by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID.Â  Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium toxicity</span>.</p>
<p>Methotrexate </p>
<p>NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices.Â  This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate.Â  Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.</p>
<p>Warfarin</p>
<p>The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> higher than users of either drug alone.</p>
<p>Antacids</p>
<p>In a single dose study (n=6), ingestion of an antacid containing 1.7 grams of magnesium hydroxide with 500 mg of mefenamic acid increased the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of mefenamic acid by 125% and 36%, respectively.<span class="Sup">1</span></p>
