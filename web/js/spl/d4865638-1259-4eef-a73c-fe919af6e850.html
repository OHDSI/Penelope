<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">The drug is rapidly absorbed after intramuscular injection and peak serum levels are generally reached within approximately one hour.Â  Doses of 7.5 mg/kg give mean peak levels of 22 mcg/mL.Â  At 8 hours following a 7.5 mg/kg dose, mean serum levels are 3.2 mcg/mL.Â  The serum half-life is 2 1/2 hours.Â  Intravenous administration of kanamycin over a period of one hour resulted in serum concentrations similar to those obtained by intramuscular administration.</p>
<p>Kanamycin diffuses rapidly into most body fluids including synovial and peritoneal fluids and bile.Â  Significant levels of the drug appear in cord blood and amniotic fluid following intramuscular administration to pregnant patients.Â  Spinal fluid concentrations in normal infants are approximately 10 to 20 percent of serum levels and may reach 50 percent when the meninges are inflamed.</p>
<p>Studies in normal adult patients have shown only trace levels of kanamycin in spinal fluid.Â  No data are available on adults with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435785" conceptname="Meningitis">meningitis</span>.</p>
<p>The drug is excreted almost entirely by glomerular filtration and is not reabsorbed by the renal tubules.Â  Hence, high concentrations are attained in the nephron, and the urine may contain levels 10 to 20 times higher than those in serum.Â  Little, if any, metabolic transformation occurs.Â  Renal excretion is extremely rapid.Â  In patients with normal renal function, approximately one-half of the administered dose is cleared within 4 hours and excretion is complete within 24 to 48 hours.Â  Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> or with diminished glomerular filtration pressure excrete kanamycin more slowly.Â  Such patients may build up excessively high blood levels which greatly increase the risk of ototoxic reactions.Â  In severely burned patients the half-life may be significantly decreased and resulting serum concentrations may be lower than anticipated from the mg per kg dose.</p>

<h2>Microbiology</h2>
<p class="First">Kanamycin is a bactericidal antibiotic which acts by inhibiting the synthesis of protein in susceptible microorganisms.Â  Kanamycin sulfate is active <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">in vitro</span></span> against many <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Staphylococcus aureus</span></span> (including penicillinase and non penicillinase-producing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span>), <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Staphylococcus epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, H. influenzae, E. coli, Enterobactor aerogenes, Shigella</span></span> and <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span></span></span> species, <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">K. pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Providencia</span></span> species, <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Acinetobacter</span></span> species and <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Citrobacter freundii</span></span> and <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Citrobacter</span></span> species, and many <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of both indole-positive and indole-negative <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Proteus</span></span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> that are frequently resistant to other antibiotics.</p>
<p>Aminoglycosides have a low order of activity against most gram-positive organisms including <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae</span></span> and <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">enterococci</span></span>.Â  <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">In vitro</span></span> studies have demonstrated that an aminoglycoside combined with an antibiotic which interferes with cell wall synthesis (i.e., Penicillin G or ampicillin) affects some Group D streptococcal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> synergistically.Â  Bacteriological testing and tests for antibiotic synergism are necessary.</p>
<p>Enzymatic inactivation of deoxystreptamine is the principal mechanism of resistance.</p>

<h2>Susceptibility Testing<br>
</h2>
<p class="First">Quantitative methods for susceptibility testing that require measurement of zone diameters give the most precise estimates of antibiotic susceptibility.Â  One such procedure has been recommended for use with discs to test susceptibility to kanamycin.Â  Interpretation involves correlation of the diameters obtained in the disc test with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for kanamycin.</p>
<p>Reports from the laboratory give results of the standardized single disc susceptibility test (Bauer, et al., Am J Clin Path 1966;45:493 and Federal Register 37:20525-20529, 1972), using a 30 mcg kanamycin disc should be interpreted according to the following criteria:</p>
<p>Organisms producing zones of 18 mm or greater, or MICâ€™s of 16 mcg or less are considered susceptible, indicating that the test organism is likely to respond to therapy.</p>
<p>Resistant organisms produce zones of 14 mm or less or MICâ€™s of 16 mcg or greater.Â  A report of â€œresistantâ€? from the laboratory indicates that the infecting organism is not likely to respond to therapy.</p>
<p>Zones greater than 14 mm and less than 18 mm, or MICâ€™s of greater than 16 mcg and less than 65 mcg, indicate intermediate susceptibility.Â  A report of â€œintermediateâ€? susceptibility suggests that the organism would be susceptible if the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> is confined to tissues and fluids (e.g., urine), in which high antibiotic levels are attained.</p>
<p>Control organisms are recommended for susceptibility testing.Â  Each time the test is performed one or more of the following organisms should be included: <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Escherichia coli</span></span> ATCC 15922, <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Staphylococcus aureus</span></span> ATCC 25923 and <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span></span> ATCC 27853.Â  The control organisms should produce zones of inhibition within the following ranges:</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Kanamycin Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Kanamycin Injection should be used only to treat or prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.Â  When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy.Â  In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p>
<p>Kanamycin injection is indicated in the shortterm treatment of serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> caused by susceptible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of the designated microorganisms below.Â  Bacteriological studies to identify the causative organisms and to determine their susceptibility to kanamycin should be performed.Â  Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining the results of susceptibility testing.</p>
<p>Kanamycin may be considered as initial therapy in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> where one or more of the following are the known or suspected pathogens: <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">E. coli, Proteus</span></span> species (both indole-positive and indole-negative), <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter</span></span> species.Â  The decision to continue therapy with the drug should be based on results of the susceptibility tests, the response of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> to therapy, and the important additional concepts contained in the <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#e0c402b7-c3d4-400b-987e-a71cd2a6bda4">WARNING</a></span></span> box above.</p>
<p>In serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> when the causative organisms are unknown, kanamycin injection, may be administered as initial therapy in conjunction with a penicillin- or cephalosporin-type drug before obtaining results of susceptibility testing.Â  If anaerobic organisms are suspected, consideration should be given to using other suitable antimicrobial therapy in conjunction with kanamycin.</p>
<p>Although kanamycin is not the drug of choice for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435459" conceptname="Staphylococcal infectious disease">staphylococcal infections</span>, it may be indicated under certain conditions for the treatment of known or suspected staphylococcal disease.Â  These situations include the initial therapy of severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> where the organism is thought to be either a Gram-negative bacterium or a staphylococcus, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> due to susceptible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of staphylococci in patients allergic to other antibiotics, and mixed staphylococcal/Gram-negative <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span>.</p>

<p>Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women.Â  Aminoglycoside antibiotics cross the placenta and there have been several reports of total, irreversible, bilateral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4318712" conceptname="Congenital deafness">congenital deafness</span> in children whose mothers received streptomycin during pregnancy.Â  Although serious side effects to fetus or newborn have not been reported in treatment of pregnant women with other aminoglycosides, the potential for harm exists.</p>
<p>Reproductive studies have been performed in rats and rabbits and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or teratogenic effects.Â  Dosages of 200 mg/kg/day in pregnant rats and pregnant guinea pigs led to hearing impairment in the off-spring.Â  There are no well-controlled studies in pregnant women but clinical experience does not include any positive evidence of adverse effects on the fetus.Â  However, if the drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard on the fetus.</p>

<p>Neurotoxic and nephrotoxic antibiotics may be almost completely absorbed from body surfaces (except the urinary bladder) after local irrigation and after topical application during surgical procedures.Â  The potential toxic effects of antibiotics administered in this fashion (otoand <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126119" conceptname="Toxic nephropathy">nephrotoxicity</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">neuromuscular blockade</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275136" conceptname="Paralysis of diaphragm">respiratory paralysis</span>) should be considered (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#e0c402b7-c3d4-400b-987e-a71cd2a6bda4">WARNING</a></span></span> box).</p>
<p>Increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126119" conceptname="Toxic nephropathy">nephrotoxicity</span> has been reported following concomitant administration of aminoglycoside antibiotics and with some cephalosporins.</p>

<p>Elderly patients may have a decrease in renal function which may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests, such as BUN or serum creatinine levels.Â  Measurement of creatinine clearance or an estimate based on published nomograms or equations may be more useful.Â  Monitoring of renal function during treatment with kanamycin, as with other aminoglycosides, is particularly important in such patients.</p>
<p>Because of high concentrations of kanamycin in the urinary excretory system, patients should be well hydrated before treatment to prevent irritation of the renal tubules.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">NOTE:</span></span> The risk of toxic reactions is low in well-hydrated patients with normal Kidney function, who receive a total dose of 15 g of kanamycin or less.</p>

<p class="First">Tests of eighth cranial nerve functions: Serial audiometric tests are suggested, particularly when renal function is impaired and/or prolonged aminoglycoside therapy is required; such tests should also be repeated periodically after treatment if there is evidence of a hearing deficit or vestibular abnormalities before or during therapy, or when consecutive or concomitant use of other potentially ototoxic drug is unavoidable.</p>
<p>Test of renal function: It should be emphasized that since renal function may alter appreciably during therapy, renal function should be tested daily or more frequently.Â  Urine should be examined for increased excretion of protein and for presence of cells and casts, keeping in mind the effects of the primary illness on these tests.Â  One or more of the following laboratory measurements should be obtained at the onset of therapy, frequently during therapy, and at, or shortly after, the end of therapy:</p>
<p>Â Â Â  Creatinine clearance rate (either carefully measured or estimated from published nomograms or equations based on patientâ€™s age, sex, body weight, and serial creatinine concentrations) (preferred over BUN).</p>
<p>Â Â Â  Serum creatinine concentration (preferred over BUN).</p>
<p>Â Â Â  Blood urea nitrogen (BUN).</p>
<p>More frequent testing is desirable if renal function is changing.Â  If signs of renal irritation appear, such as casts, white or red cells, and albumin, hydration should be increased and a reduction in dosage may be desirable (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#d0efcaa0-c67f-4b35-b04a-4a3af4f0b01b">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span></span>).Â  These signs usually disappear when treatment is completed.Â  However, if <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4261202" conceptname="Uremia">azotemia</span> or a progressive decrease of urine output occurs, treatment should be stopped.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">In the event of overdosage or toxic reaction, hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis will aid in the removal of kanamycin from the blood.Â  In the newborn infant, exchange transfusion may also be considered.</p>
</div>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Kanamycin injection may be given intramuscularly or intravenously.Â  The patientâ€™s pretreatment body weight should be obtained for calculation of the correct dosage.Â  The dosage of an aminoglycoside in obese patients should be based on an estimate of the lean body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span>.Â  The status of renal function should be determined by measurement of serum creatinine concentration or calculation of the endogenous creatinine clearance rate.Â  The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is much less reliable for this purpose.Â  Renal function should be reassessed frequently during therapy.</p>
<p>It is desirable to measure both peak and trough serum concentrations intermittently during therapy since both concentrations are used to determine the adequacy and safety of the dose and to adjust the dosage during treatment.Â  Peak serum concentrations (30 to 90 minutes after injection) above 35 mcg per mL and trough concentrations (just prior to the next dose) above 10 mcg per mL should be avoided.</p>

<h2>Intramuscular Route<br>
</h2>
<p class="First">Inject deeply into the upper outer quadrant of the gluteal muscle.Â  The recommended dose for adults or children is 15 mg/kg/day in two equally divided dosages administered at equally divided intervals; i.e., 7.5 mg/kg q12h.Â  If continuously high blood levels are desired, the daily dose of 15 mg/kg may be given in equally divided doses every 6 or 8 hours.Â  Treatment of patients in the heavier weight classes, i.e., 100 kg, should not exceed 1.5 g/day.</p>
<p>In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>, it is desirable to follow therapy by appropriate serum assays.Â  If this is not feasible, a suggested method is to reduce the frequency of administration in patients with renal dysfunction.Â  The interval between doses may be calculated with the following formula:</p>
<p>Serum creatinine (mg/100 mL) x 9 = Dosage Interval (in hours); e.g., if the serum creatinine is 2 mg, the recommended dose (7.5 mg/kg) should be administered every 18 hours.Â  Changes in creatinine concentration during therapy would, of course, necessitate changes in the dosage frequency.</p>
<p>It is desirable to limit the duration of treatment with kanamycin to short-term.Â  The usual duration of treatment is 7 to 10 days.Â  Total daily dose by all routes of administration should not exceed 1.5 g/day.Â  If longer therapy is required, measurement of kanamycin peak and trough serum concentrations is particularly important as a basis for determining the adequacy and safety of the dose.Â  These patients should be carefully monitored for changes in renal, auditory, and vestibular function.Â  Dosage should be adjusted as needed.Â  The risks of toxicity multiply as the length of treatment increases.</p>
<p>At the recommended dosage level, uncomplicated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> due to kanamycin-susceptible organisms should respond to therapy in 24 to 48 hours.Â  If definite clinical response does not occur within 3 to 5 days, therapy should be stopped and the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the invading organism should be rechecked.Â  Failure of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> to respond may be due to resistance of the organism or to the presence of septic foci requiring surgical drainage.</p>

<h2>Intravenous Administration<br>
</h2>
<p class="First">The dose should not exceed 15 mg/kg per day and must be administered slowly.Â  The solution for intravenous use is prepared by adding the contents of a 500 mg vial to 100 to 200 mL of sterile diluent such as Normal Saline or 5% Dextrose in Water, or the contents of a 1g vial to 200 to 400 mL of sterile diluent.Â  The appropriate dose is administered over a 30- to 60-minute period.Â  The total daily dose should be divided into 2 or 3 equally divided doses.</p>
<p>Kanamycin Injection, USP should not be physically mixed with other antibacterial agents but each should be administered separately in accordance with its recommended route of administration and dosage schedule.</p>
