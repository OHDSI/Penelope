<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<br><p class="First">The mechanism of action of sertraline is presumed to be linked to its inhibition of CNS neuronal uptake of serotonin (5HT). Studies at clinically relevant doses in man have demonstrated that sertraline blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. <span class="Italics">In vitro </span>studies in animals also suggest that sertraline is a potent and selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake. <span class="Italics">In vitro </span>studies have shown that sertraline has no significant affinity for adrenergic (alpha<span class="Sub">1</span>, alpha<span class="Sub">2</span>, beta), cholinergic, GABA, dopaminergic, histaminergic, serotonergic (5HT<span class="Sub">1A</span>, 5HT<span class="Sub">1B</span>, 5HT<span class="Sub">2</span>), or benzodiazepine receptors; antagonism of such receptors has been hypothesized to be associated with various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular effects for other psychotropic drugs. The chronic administration of sertraline was found in animals to down regulate brain norepinephrine receptors, as has been observed with other drugs effective in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>. Sertraline does not inhibit monoamine oxidase.</p>

<a name="Section_2.2.1"></a><a name="section-2.2.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Systemic Bioavailability</h3>
<br><p class="First">In man, following oral once-daily dosing over the range of 50 to 200 mg for 14 days, mean peak plasma concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of sertraline occurred between 4.5 to 8.4 hours post-dosing. The average terminal elimination half-life of plasma sertraline is about 26 hours. Based on this pharmacokinetic parameter, steady-state sertraline plasma levels should be achieved after approximately one week of once-daily dosing. Linear dose-proportional pharmacokinetics were demonstrated in a single dose study in which the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of sertraline were proportional to dose over a range of 50 to 200 mg. Consistent with the terminal elimination half-life, there is an approximately two-fold accumulation, compared to a single dose, of sertraline with repeated dosing over a 50 to 200 mg dose range. The single dose bioavailability of sertraline tablets is approximately equal to an equivalent dose of solution.<br><br>In a relative bioavailability study comparing the pharmacokinetics of 100 mg sertraline as the oral solution to a 100 mg sertraline tablet in 16 healthy adults, the solution to tablet ratio of geometric mean AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> values were 114.8% and 120.6%, respectively. 90% confidence intervals (CI) were within the range of 80 to 125% with the exception of the upper 90% CI limit for C<span class="Sub">max </span>which was 126.5%.<br><br>The effects of food on the bioavailability of the sertraline tablet and oral solution were studied in subjects administered a single dose with and without food. For the tablet, AUC was slightly increased when drug was administered with food but the C<span class="Sub">max</span> was 25% greater, while the time to reach peak plasma concentration (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) decreased from 8 hours post-dosing to 5.5 hours. For the oral solution, T<span class="Sub">max</span> was slightly prolonged from 5.9 hours to 7 hours with food.</p>

<h3>Metabolism</h3>
<br><p class="First">Sertraline undergoes extensive first pass metabolism. The principal initial pathway of metabolism for sertraline is N-demethylation. N-desmethylsertraline has a plasma terminal elimination half-life of 62 to 104 hours. Both <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>biochemical and <span class="Italics">in vivo </span>pharmacological testing have shown N-desmethylsertraline to be substantially less active than sertraline. Both sertraline and N-desmethylsertraline undergo oxidative deamination and subsequent reduction, hydroxylation, and glucuronide conjugation. In a study of radiolabeled sertraline involving two healthy male subjects, sertraline accounted for less than 5% of the plasma radioactivity. About 40 to 45% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in urine in 9 days. Unchanged sertraline was not detectable in the urine. For the same period, about 40 to 45% of the administered radioactivity was accounted for in feces, including 12 to 14% unchanged sertraline.<br><br>Desmethylsertraline exhibits time-related, dose dependent increases in AUC (0 to 24 hour)<span class="Sub">,</span> C<span class="Sub">max</span> and C<span class="Sub">min</span>, with about a 5 to 9 fold increase in these pharmacokinetic parameters between day 1 and day 14.</p>

<h3>Protein Binding</h3>
<br><p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro </span>protein binding studies performed with radiolabeled <span class="Sup">3</span>H-sertraline showed that sertraline is highly bound to serum proteins (98%) in the range of 20 to 500 ng/mL. However, at up to 300 and 200 ng/mL concentrations, respectively, sertraline and N-desmethylsertraline did not alter the plasma protein binding of two other highly protein bound drugs, viz., warfarin and propranolol (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_6">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>).</p>

<h2>Pediatric Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<br><p class="First">Sertraline pharmacokinetics were evaluated in a group of 61 pediatric patients (29 aged 6 to 12 years, 32 aged 13 to 17 years) with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Patients included both males (N=28) and females (N=33).  During 42 days of chronic sertraline dosing, sertraline was titrated up to 200 mg/day and maintained at that dose for a minimum of 11 days.  On the final day of sertraline 200 mg/day, the 6 to 12 year old group exhibited a mean sertraline AUC (0 to 24 hr) of 3107 ng-hr/mL, mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> of 165 ng/mL, and mean half-life of 26.2 hr. The 13 to 17 year old group exhibited a mean sertraline AUC (0 to 24 hr) of 2296 ng-hr/mL, mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> of 123 ng/mL, and mean half-life of 27.8 hr. Higher plasma levels in the 6 to 12 year old group were largely attributable to patients with lower body weights. No gender associated differences were observed.  By comparison, a group of 22 separately studied adults between 18 and 45 years of age (11 male, 11 female) received 30 days of 200 mg/day sertraline and exhibited a mean sertraline AUC (0 to 24 hr) of 2570 ng-hr/mL, mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> of 142 ng/mL, and mean half-life of 27.2 hr.  Relative to the adults, both the 6 to 12 year olds and the 13 to 17 year olds showed about 22% lower AUC (0 to 24 hr) and C<span class="Sub">max</span> values when plasma concentration was adjusted for weight. These data suggest that pediatric patients metabolize sertraline with slightly greater efficiency than adults. Nevertheless, lower doses may be advisable for pediatric patients given their lower body weights, especially in very young patients, in order to avoid excessive plasma levels (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_10">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>

<h3>Age</h3>
<br><p class="First">Sertraline plasma clearance in a group of 16 (8 male, 8 female) elderly patients treated for 14 days at a dose of 100 mg/day was approximately 40% lower than in a similarly studied group of younger (25 to 32 y.o.)  individuals. Steady-state, therefore, should be achieved after 2 to 3 weeks in older patients. The same study showed a decreased clearance of desmethylsertraline in older males, but not in older females.</p>

<h3>Liver Disease</h3>
<br><p class="First">As might be predicted from its primary site of metabolism, liver impairment can affect the elimination of sertraline. In patients with chronic mild liver impairment (N=10, 8 patients with Child-Pugh scores of 5 to 6 and 2 patients with Child-Pugh scores of 7 to 8) who received 50 mg sertraline per day maintained for 21 days, sertraline clearance was reduced, resulting in approximately 3-fold greater exposure compared to age-matched volunteers with no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> (N=10). The exposure to desmethylsertraline was approximately 2-fold greater compared to age-matched volunteers with no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>. There were no significant differences in plasma protein binding observed between the two groups. The effects of sertraline in patients with moderate and severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> have not been studied. The results suggest that the use of sertraline in patients with liver disease must be approached with caution. If sertraline is administered to patients with liver impairment, a lower or less frequent dose should be used (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_6">PRECAUTIONS</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_10">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>

<h3><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">Renal Disease</span></h3>
<br><p class="First">Sertraline is extensively metabolized and excretion of unchanged drug in urine is a minor route of elimination. In volunteers with mild to moderate (CLcr=30 to 60 mL/min), moderate to severe (CLcr=10 to 29 mL/min) or severe (receiving hemodialysis) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (N=10 each group), the pharmacokinetics and protein binding of 200 mg sertraline per day maintained for 21 days were not altered compared to age-matched volunteers (N=12) with no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>.

<h3>Major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depressive Disorder</span></h3>
<br><p class="First">The efficacy of sertraline hydrochloride as a treatment for major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> was established in two placebo-controlled studies in adult outpatients meeting DSM-III criteria for major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>. Study 1 was an 8-week study with flexible dosing of sertraline hydrochloride in a range of 50 to 200 mg/day; the mean dose for completers was 145 mg/day. Study 2 was a 6-week fixed-dose study, including sertraline hydrochloride doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/day. Overall, these studies demonstrated sertraline hydrochloride to be superior to placebo on the Hamilton <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> Rating Scale and the Clinical Global Impression Severity and Improvement scales. Study 2 was not readily interpretable regarding a dose response relationship for effectiveness.<br><br>Study 3 involved depressed outpatients who had responded by the end of an initial 8-week open treatment phase on sertraline hydrochloride 50 to 200 mg/day. These patients (N=295) were randomized to continuation for 44 weeks on double-blind sertraline hydrochloride 50 to 200 mg/day or placebo. A statistically significantly lower relapse rate was observed for patients taking sertraline hydrochloride compared to those on placebo. The mean dose for completers was 70 mg/day.<br><br>Analyses for gender effects on outcome did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of sex.<br><br>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)<br><br>The effectiveness of sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of OCD was demonstrated in three multicenter placebo-controlled studies of adult outpatients (Studies 1 to 3). Patients in all studies had moderate to severe OCD (DSM-III or DSM-III-R) with mean baseline ratings on the Yale–Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) total score ranging from 23 to 25.<br><br>Study 1 was an 8-week study with flexible dosing of sertraline hydrochloride in a range of 50 to 200 mg/day; the mean dose for completers was 186 mg/day. Patients receiving sertraline hydrochloride experienced a mean reduction of approximately 4 points on the YBOCS total score which was significantly greater than the mean reduction of 2 points in placebo-treated patients.<br><br>Study 2 was a 12-week fixed-dose study, including sertraline hydrochloride doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/day. Patients receiving sertraline hydrochloride doses of 50 and 200 mg/day experienced mean reductions of approximately 6 points on the YBOCS total score which were significantly greater than the approximately 3 point reduction in placebo-treated patients.<br><br>Study 3 was a 12-week study with flexible dosing of sertraline hydrochloride in a range of 50 to 200 mg/day; the mean dose for completers was 185 mg/day. Patients receiving sertraline hydrochloride experienced a mean reduction of approximately 7 points on the YBOCS total score which was significantly greater than the mean reduction of approximately 4 points in placebo-treated patients.<br><br>Analyses for age and gender effects on outcome did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of age or sex.<br><br>The effectiveness of sertraline hydrochloride for the treatment of OCD was also demonstrated in a 12-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in a pediatric outpatient population (children and adolescents, ages 6 to 17). Patients receiving sertraline hydrochloride in this study were initiated at doses of either 25 mg/day (children, ages 6 to 12) or 50 mg/day (adolescents, ages 13 to 17), and then titrated over the next four weeks to a maximum dose of 200 mg/day, as tolerated. The mean dose for completers was 178 mg/day. Dosing was once a day in the morning or evening. Patients in this study had moderate to severe OCD (DSM-III-R) with mean baseline ratings on the Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CYBOCS) total score of 22. Patients receiving sertraline experienced a mean reduction of approximately 7 units on the CYBOCS total score which was significantly greater than the 3 unit reduction for placebo patients. Analyses for age and gender effects on outcome did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of age or sex. <br><br>In a longer-term study, patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for OCD who had responded during a 52-week single-blind trial on sertraline hydrochloride 50 to 200 mg/day (n=224) were randomized to continuation of sertraline hydrochloride or to substitution of placebo for up to 28 weeks of observation for discontinuation due to relapse or insufficient clinical response. Response during the single-blind phase was defined as a decrease in the YBOCS score of ≥ 25% compared to baseline and a CGI-­I of 1 (very much improved), 2 (much improved) or 3 (minimally improved). Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as the following conditions being met (on three consecutive visits for 1 and 2, and for visit 3 for condition 3): (1) YBOCS score increased by ≥ 5 points, to a minimum of 20, relative to baseline; (2) CGI-I increased by ≥ one point; and (3) worsening of the patient’s condition in the investigator’s judgment, to justify alternative treatment. Insufficient clinical response indicated a worsening of the patient’s condition that resulted in study discontinuation, as assessed by the investigator. Patients receiving continued sertraline hydrochloride treatment experienced a significantly lower rate of discontinuation due to relapse or insufficient clinical response over the subsequent 28 weeks compared to those receiving placebo.

Sertraline hydrochloride was initiated at 25 mg/day for the first week, and patients were then dosed in the range of 50 to 200 mg/day on the basis of clinical response and toleration. The mean sertraline hydrochloride dose for completers was 146 mg/day and 151 mg/day, respectively for Studies 1 and 2. Study outcome was assessed by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale Part 2 (CAPS) which is a multi-item instrument that measures the three PTSD diagnostic symptom clusters of reexperiencing/intrusion, avoidance/numbing, and hyperarousal as well as the patient-rated Impact of Event Scale (IES) which measures intrusion and avoidance symptoms. Sertraline hydrochloride was shown to be significantly more effective than placebo on change from baseline to endpoint on the CAPS, IES and on the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Severity of Illness and Global Improvement scores. In two additional placebo-controlled PTSD trials, the difference in response to treatment between patients receiving sertraline hydrochloride and patients receiving placebo was not statistically significant. One of these additional studies was conducted in patients similar to those recruited for Studies 1 and 2, while the second additional study was conducted in predominantly male veterans.<br><br>As PTSD is a more common disorder in women than men, the majority (76%) of patients in these trials were women (152 and 139 women on sertraline and placebo versus 39 and 55 men on sertraline and placebo; Studies 1 and 2 combined). Post hoc exploratory analyses revealed a significant difference between sertraline hydrochloride and placebo on the CAPS, IES and CGI in women, regardless of baseline diagnosis of comorbid major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, but essentially no effect in the relatively smaller number of men in these studies.

There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.<br><br>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440374" conceptname="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">obsessive compulsive disorder</span> (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied.<span class="Bold"> </span>There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.    </p>

<h3>Potential Effects of Coadministration of Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Proteins</h3>
<br><p class="First">Because sertraline is tightly bound to plasma protein, the administration of sertraline hydrochloride to a patient taking another drug which is tightly bound to protein (e.g., warfarin, digitoxin) may cause a shift in plasma concentrations potentially resulting in an adverse effect. Conversely, adverse effects may result from displacement of protein bound sertraline hydrochloride by other tightly bound drugs.<br><br>In a study comparing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time AUC (0 to 120 hr) following dosing with warfarin (0.75 mg/kg) before and after 21 days of dosing with either sertraline hydrochloride (50 to 200 mg/day) or placebo, there was a mean increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time of 8% relative to baseline for sertraline hydrochloride compared to a 1% decrease for placebo (p&lt;0.02).

<h3>CNS Active Drugs</h3>
<br><p class="First">In a study comparing the disposition of intravenously administered diazepam before and after 21 days of dosing with either sertraline hydrochloride (50 to 200 mg/day escalating dose) or placebo, there was a 32% decrease relative to baseline in diazepam clearance for the sertraline hydrochloride group compared to a 19% decrease relative to baseline for the placebo group (p&lt;0.03). There was a 23% increase in T<span class="Sub">max</span> for desmethyldiazepam in the sertraline hydrochloride group compared to a 20% decrease in the placebo group (p&lt;0.03). The clinical significance of these changes is unknown.<br><br>In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, the administration of two doses of sertraline hydrochloride did not significantly alter steady-state lithium levels or the renal clearance of lithium.<br><br>Nonetheless, at this time, it is recommended that plasma lithium levels be monitored following initiation of sertraline hydrochloride therapy with appropriate adjustments to the lithium dose.<br><br>In a controlled study of a single dose (2 mg) of pimozide, 200 mg sertraline (q.d.) co-administration to steady state was associated with a mean increase in pimozide AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of about 40%, but was not associated with any changes in EKG. Since the highest recommended pimozide dose (10 mg) has not been evaluated in combination with sertraline, the effect on QT interval and PK parameters at doses higher than 2 mg at this time are not known. While the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, due to the narrow therapeutic index of pimozide and due to the interaction noted at a low dose of pimozide, concomitant administration of sertraline hydrochloride and pimozide should be contraindicated (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_4">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span>).<br><br>Results of a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers suggest that chronic administration of sertraline 200 mg/day does not produce clinically important inhibition of phenytoin metabolism. Nonetheless, at this time, it is recommended that plasma phenytoin concentrations be monitored following initiation of sertraline hydrochloride therapy with appropriate adjustments to the phenytoin dose, particularly in patients with multiple underlying medical conditions and/or those receiving multiple concomitant medications.<br><br>The effect of sertraline hydrochloride on valproate levels has not been evaluated in clinical trials. In the absence of such data, it is recommended that plasma valproate levels be monitored following initiation of sertraline hydrochloride therapy with appropriate adjustments to the valproate dose.<br><br>The risk of using sertraline hydrochloride in combination with other CNS active drugs has not been systematically evaluated. Consequently, caution is advised if the concomitant administration of sertraline hydrochloride and such drugs is required.<br><br><br>There is limited controlled experience regarding the optimal timing of switching from other drugs effective in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, obsessive-compulsive disorder, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span>, posttraumatic stress disorder, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242733" conceptname="Premenstrual dysphoric disorder">premenstrual dysphoric disorder</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span> to sertraline hydrochloride.

The results of these studies indicated that sertraline did not increase plasma concentrations of terfenadine, carbamazepine, or cisapride. These data indicate that sertraline’s extent of inhibition of P450 3A4 activity is not likely to be of clinical significance.

<h3>Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6</h3>
<br><p class="First">Many drugs effective in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, e.g., the SSRIs, including sertraline, and most tricyclic antidepressant drugs effective in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> inhibit the biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase), and, thus, may increase the plasma concentrations of co-administered drugs that are metabolized by P450 2D6. The drugs for which this potential interaction is of greatest concern are those metabolized primarily by 2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic index, e.g., the tricyclic antidepressant drugs effective in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide. The extent to which this interaction is an important clinical problem depends on the extent of the inhibition of P450 2D6 by the antidepressant and the therapeutic index of the co-administered drug. There is variability among the drugs effective in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> in the extent of clinically important 2D6 inhibition, and in fact sertraline at lower doses has a less prominent inhibitory effect on 2D6 than some others in the class. Nevertheless, even sertraline has the potential for clinically important 2D6 inhibition. Consequently, concomitant use of a drug metabolized by P450 2D6 with sertraline hydrochloride may require lower doses than usually prescribed for the other drug. Furthermore, whenever sertraline hydrochloride is withdrawn from co-therapy, an increased dose of the co-administered drug may be required (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_6.4.10">Tricyclic Antidepressant Drugs Effective in the Treatment of Major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depressive Disorder</span></a></span> under <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_6.4.10">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>).</p>

<br><p class="First">The extent to which SSRI-TCA interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the co-administration of TCAs with sertraline hydrochloride, because sertraline may inhibit TCA metabolism. Plasma TCA concentrations may need to be monitored, and the dose of TCA may need to be reduced, if a TCA is co-administered with sertraline hydrochloride (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_6.4.6">Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6</a></span> under <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_6.4.6">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>).</p>

<h3>Hypoglycemic Drugs</h3>
<br><p class="First">In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, administration of sertraline hydrochloride for 22 days (including 200 mg/day for the final 13 days) caused a statistically significant 16% decrease from baseline in the clearance of tolbutamide following an intravenous 1000 mg dose. Sertraline hydrochloride administration did not noticeably change either the plasma protein binding or the apparent volume of distribution of tolbutamide, suggesting that the decreased clearance was due to a change in the metabolism of the drug. The clinical significance of this decrease in tolbutamide clearance is unknown.</p>

In clinical studies, sertraline hydrochloride was shown to induce hepatic enzymes minimally as determined by a small (5%) but statistically significant decrease in antipyrine half-life following administration of 200 mg/day for 21 days. This small change in antipyrine half-life reflects a clinically insignificant change in hepatic metabolism.</p>

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<br><p class="First">The efficacy of sertraline hydrochloride for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder was demonstrated in a 12-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled study with 187 outpatients ages 6 to 17 (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_2.4">Clinical Trials</a></span> under <span class="Bold"><a href="#cp">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span>).

Two placebo controlled trials (n=373) in pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with sertraline hydrochloride, and the data were not sufficient to support a claim for use in pediatric patients. Anyone considering the use of sertraline hydrochloride in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need.<br><br>The safety of sertraline hydrochloride use in children and adolescents with OCD, ages 6 to 18, was evaluated in a 12-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled study with 187 outpatients, ages 6 to 17, and in a flexible dose, 52 week open extension study of 137 patients, ages 6 to 18, who had completed the initial 12-­week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Sertraline hydrochloride was administered at doses of either 25 mg/day (children, ages 6 to 12) or 50 mg/day (adolescents, ages 13 to 18) and then titrated in weekly 25 mg/day or 50 mg/day increments, respectively, to a maximum dose of 200 mg/day based upon clinical response. The mean dose for completers was 157 mg/day. In the acute 12 week pediatric study and in the 52 week study, sertraline hydrochloride had an adverse event profile generally similar to that observed in adults.<br><br>Sertraline pharmacokinetics were evaluated in 61 pediatric patients between 6 and 17 years of age with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> or OCD and revealed similar drug exposures to those of adults when plasma concentration was adjusted for weight (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_2.2">Pharmacokinetics</a></span> under <span class="Bold"><a href="#cp">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span>).<br><br>Approximately 600 patients with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> or OCD between 6 and 17 years of age have received sertraline hydrochloride in clinical trials, both controlled and uncontrolled.

At baseline the mean weight for children was 39 kg for sertraline and 38.5 kg for placebo. At baseline the mean weight for adolescents was 61.4 kg for sertraline and 62.5 kg for placebo. There was a bigger difference between sertraline and placebo in the proportion of outliers for clinically important <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> in children than in adolescents. For children, about 7% had a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> &gt; 7% of body weight compared to none of the placebo patients; for adolescents, about 2% had a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> &gt; 7% of body weight compared to about 1% of the placebo patients. A subset of these patients who completed the randomized controlled trials (sertraline n=99, placebo n=122) were continued into a 24-week, flexible-dose, open-label, extension study. A mean <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> of approximately 0.5 kg was seen during the first eight weeks of treatment for subjects with first exposure to sertraline during the open-label extension study, similar to mean <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> observed among sertraline treated subjects during the first eight weeks of the randomized controlled trials.

The prescriber should be mindful that the evidence relied upon to conclude that sertraline is safe for use in children and adolescents derives from clinical studies that were 10 to 52 weeks in duration and from the extrapolation of experience gained with adult patients.  In particular, there are no studies that directly evaluate the effects of long-term sertraline use on the growth, development, and maturation of children and adolescents. Although there is no affirmative finding to suggest that sertraline possesses a capacity to adversely affect growth, development or maturation, the absence of such findings is not compelling evidence of the absence of the potential of sertraline to have adverse effects in chronic use (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_5.1">WARNINGS–Clinical Worsening and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> Risk</a></span>).</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<br><p class="First">During its premarketing assessment, multiple doses of sertraline hydrochloride were administered to over 4000 adult subjects as of February 18, 2000. The conditions and duration of exposure to sertraline hydrochloride varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) clinical pharmacology studies, open and double-blind studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, fixed-dose and titration studies, and studies for multiple indications, including major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, OCD, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span>, PTSD, PMDD and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span>.<br><br>Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories.<br><br>In the tabulations that follow, a World Health Organization dictionary of terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the over 4000 adult individuals exposed to multiple doses of sertraline hydrochloride who experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving sertraline hydrochloride. An event was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. It is important to emphasize that events reported during therapy were not necessarily caused by it.<br><br>The prescriber should be aware that the figures in the tables and tabulations cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to the side effect incidence rate in the population studied.</p>

In particular, some evidence suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can cause such untoward sexual experiences. Reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, however, in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in product labeling, are likely to underestimate their actual incidence. <br><br>Table 5 below displays the incidence of sexual side effects reported by at least 2% of patients taking sertraline hydrochloride in placebo-controlled trials.</p>

<h2>Other Adverse Events in Pediatric Patients</h2>
<br><p class="First">In over 600 pediatric patients treated with sertraline hydrochloride, the overall profile of adverse events was generally similar to that seen in adult studies. However, the following adverse events, from controlled trials, not appearing in Tables 2 and 3, were reported at an incidence of at least 2% and occurred at a rate of at least twice the placebo rate (N=281 patients treated with sertraline hydrochloride): <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4195305" conceptname="Hyperactive behavior">hyperkinesia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197672" conceptname="Urinary incontinence">urinary incontinence</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021344" conceptname="Abusive behavior">aggressive reaction</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4283893" conceptname="Sinusitis">sinusitis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318556" conceptname="Epistaxis">epistaxis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047773" conceptname="Purpura">purpura</span>.</p>

<h2>Other Events Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Sertraline Hydrochloride</h2>
<br><p class="First">Following is a list of treatment-emergent adverse events reported during premarketing assessment of sertraline hydrochloride in clinical trials (over 4000 adult subjects) except those already listed in the previous tables or elsewhere in labeling.<br><br>In the tabulations that follow, a World Health Organization dictionary of terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the over 4000 adult individuals exposed to multiple doses of sertraline hydrochloride who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving sertraline hydrochloride. All events are included except those already listed in the previous tables or elsewhere in labeling and those reported in terms so general as to be uninformative and those for which a causal relationship to sertraline hydrochloride treatment seemed remote. It is important to emphasize that although the events reported occurred during treatment with sertraline hydrochloride, they were not necessarily caused by it.<br><br>Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.

<br><p class="First">In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study of the comparative abuse liability of sertraline hydrochloride, alprazolam, and d-amphetamine in humans, sertraline hydrochloride did not produce the positive subjective effects indicative of abuse potential, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142453" conceptname="Feeling high">euphoria</span> or drug liking, that were observed with the other two drugs. Premarketing clinical experience with sertraline hydrochloride did not reveal any tendency for a withdrawal syndrome or any drug-seeking behavior. In animal studies sertraline hydrochloride does not demonstrate stimulant or barbiturate-like (depressant) abuse potential. As with any CNS active drug, however, physicians should carefully evaluate patients for history of drug abuse and follow such patients closely, observing them for signs of sertraline hydrochloride misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, incrementation of dose, drug-seeking behavior).</p>

<h2>Switching a Patient To or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Intended to Treat Psychiatric Disorders</h2>
<p class="First">At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with sertraline hydrochloride. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping sertraline hydrochloride before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders (see <a href="#Section_4">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>).<br><span class="Bold"><br>Use of </span><span class="Bold">Sertraline Hydrochloride </span><span class="Bold">With Other MAOIs Such as Linezolid or Methylene Blue<br></span><br>Do not start sertraline hydrochloride in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue because there is increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span>. In a patient who requires more urgent treatment of a psychiatric condition, other interventions, including hospitalization, should be considered (see <a href="#Section_4">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>).<br><br>In some cases, a patient already receiving sertraline hydrochloride therapy may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span> in a particular patient, sertraline hydrochloride should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered.

Therapy with sertraline hydrochloride may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue (see <a href="#Section_5">WARNINGS</a>).<br><br>The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg/kg with sertraline hydrochloride is unclear.

Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered.  Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate.</p>
