<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">The efficacy of paroxetine in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242733" conceptname="Premenstrual dysphoric disorder">premenstrual dysphoric disorder</span> (PMDD) is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system resulting from inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-hydroxy-tryptamine, 5-HT). Studies at clinically relevant doses in humans have demonstrated that paroxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies in animals also suggest that paroxetine is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> radioligand binding studies indicate that paroxetine has little affinity for muscarinic, alpha<span class="Sub">1</span>-, alpha<span class="Sub">2</span>-, beta-adrenergic-, dopamine (D<span class="Sub">2</span>)-, 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span>-, 5-HT<span class="Sub">2</span>- and histamine (H<span class="Sub">1</span>)-receptors; antagonism of muscarinic, histaminergic and alpha<span class="Sub">1</span>-adrenergic receptors has been associated with various anticholinergic, sedative and cardiovascular effects for other psychotropic drugs. </p>
<p>Because the relative potencies of paroxetine’s major metabolites are at most 1/50 of the parent compound, they are essentially inactive. </p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics </h2>
<p class="First">Paroxetine hydrochloride is completely absorbed after oral dosing of a solution of the hydrochloride salt. The elimination half-life is approximately 15 to 20 hours after a single dose of paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Paroxetine is extensively metabolized and the metabolites are considered to be inactive. Nonlinearity in pharmacokinetics is observed with increasing doses. Paroxetine metabolism is mediated in part by CYP2D6 and the metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine and to some extent in the feces. Pharmacokinetic behavior of paroxetine has not been evaluated in subjects who are deficient in CYP2D6 (poor metabolizers).</p>

<h3>Absorption and Distribution</h3>
<p class="First">Paroxetine hydrochloride is completely absorbed after oral dosing of a solution of the hydrochloride salt. In a study in which normal male and female subjects (n = 23) received single oral doses of paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets at four dosage strengths (12.5 mg, 25 mg, 37.5 mg and 50 mg), paroxetine C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0-inf</span> increased disproportionately with dose (as seen also with immediate-release formulations). Mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0-inf</span> values at these doses were 2, 5.5, 9 and 12.5 ng/mL and 121, 261, 338 and 540 ng•hr/mL, respectively. T<span class="Sub">max</span> was observed typically between 6 and 10 hours post-dose, reflecting a reduction in absorption rate compared with immediate-release formulations. The bioavailability of 25 mg paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not affected by food. </p>
<p>Paroxetine distributes throughout the body, including the CNS, with only 1% remaining in the plasma. </p>
<p>Approximately 95% and 93% of paroxetine is bound to plasma protein at 100 ng/mL and 400 ng/mL, respectively. Under clinical conditions, paroxetine concentrations would normally be less than 400 ng/mL. Paroxetine does not alter the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> protein binding of phenytoin or warfarin. </p>

<h3>Metabolism and Excretion</h3>
<p class="First">The mean elimination half-life of paroxetine was 15 to 20 hours throughout a range of single doses of paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets (12.5 mg, 25 mg, 37.5 mg and 50 mg). During repeated administration of paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets (25 mg once daily), steady-state was reached within 2 weeks (i.e., comparable to immediate-release formulations). In a repeat dose study in which normal male and female subjects (n = 23) received paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets (25 mg daily), mean steady-state C<span class="Sub">max</span>, C<span class="Sub">min</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0-24 </span>values were 30 ng/mL, 20 ng/mL and 550 ng•hr/mL, respectively. </p>
<p>Based on studies using immediate-release formulations, steady-state drug exposure based on AUC<span class="Sub">0-24</span> was several-fold greater than would have been predicted from single-dose data. The excess accumulation is a consequence of the fact that one of the enzymes that metabolizes paroxetine is readily saturable. </p>
<p>In steady-state dose proportionality studies involving elderly and nonelderly patients, at doses of the immediate-release formulation of 20 mg to 40 mg daily for the elderly and 20 mg to 50 mg daily for the nonelderly, some nonlinearity was observed in both populations, again reflecting a saturable metabolic pathway. In comparison to C<span class="Sub">min</span> values after 20 mg daily, values after 40 mg daily were only about 2 to 3 times greater than doubled. </p>
<p>Paroxetine is extensively metabolized after oral administration. The principal metabolites are polar and conjugated products of oxidation and methylation, which are readily cleared. Conjugates with glucuronic acid and sulfate predominate and major metabolites have been isolated and identified. Data indicate that the metabolites have no more than 1/50 the potency of the parent compound at inhibiting serotonin uptake. The metabolism of paroxetine is accomplished in part by CYP2D6. Saturation of this enzyme at clinical doses appears to account for the nonlinearity of paroxetine kinetics with increasing dose and increasing duration of treatment. The role of this enzyme in paroxetine metabolism also suggests potential drug-drug interactions (see <a href="#i4i_section_id_891f2d48-418d-45ef-8d3a-d60ce01b6c8e">PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions: Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6</a>). </p>
<p>Approximately 64% of a 30 mg oral solution dose of paroxetine was excreted in the urine with 2% as the parent compound and 62% as metabolites over a 10 day post-dosing period. About 36% was excreted in the feces (probably via the bile), mostly as metabolites and less than 1% as the parent compound over the 10 day post-dosing period. </p>

<h4>Renal and Liver Disease</h4>
<p class="First">Increased plasma concentrations of paroxetine occur in subjects with renal and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>. The mean plasma concentrations in patients with creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min was approximately 4 times greater than seen in normal volunteers. Patients with creatinine clearance of 30 to 60 mL/min and patients with hepatic functional impairment had about a 2-fold increase in plasma concentrations (AUC, C<span class="Sub">max</span>). </p>
<p>The initial dosage should therefore be reduced in patients with severe renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> and upward titration, if necessary, should be at increased intervals (see <a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_01e63e2a-8f58-4340-94d7-0d290e013527">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>). </p>

<h4>Elderly Patients</h4>
<p class="First">In a multiple-dose study in the elderly at daily doses of 20 mg, 30 mg and 40 mg of the immediate-release formulation, C<span class="Sub">min</span> concentrations were about 70% to 80% greater than the respective C<span class="Sub">min</span> concentrations in nonelderly subjects. Therefore the initial dosage in the elderly should be reduced (see <a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_01e63e2a-8f58-4340-94d7-0d290e013527">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>). </p>

<h3>Drug-Drug Interactions</h3>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> drug interaction studies reveal that paroxetine inhibits CYP2D6. Clinical drug interaction studies have been performed with substrates of CYP2D6 and show that paroxetine can inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 including desipramine, risperidone and atomoxetine (see <a href="#i4i_section_id_dd66d493-fedd-43ef-ab52-4d8f85baeaac">PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions</a>). </p>

<h3>Major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depressive Disorder</span></h3>
<p class="First">The efficacy of paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets as a treatment for major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> has been established in two 12 week, flexible dose, placebo-controlled studies of patients with DSM-IV Major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depressive Disorder</span>. One study included patients in the age range 18 to 65 years and a second study included elderly patients, ranging in age from 60 to 88. In both studies, paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets were shown to be significantly more effective than placebo in treating major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> as measured by the following: Hamilton <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> Rating Scale (HDRS), the Hamilton <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="40546087" conceptname="Depressed mood">depressed mood</span> item and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)–Severity of Illness score. </p>
<p>A study of outpatients with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> who had responded to immediate-release paroxetine tablets (HDRS total score &lt; 8) during an initial 8 week open treatment phase and were then randomized to continuation on immediate-release paroxetine tablets or placebo for one year demonstrated a significantly lower relapse rate for patients taking immediate-release paroxetine tablets (15%) compared to those on placebo (39%). Effectiveness was similar for male and female patients. </p>

<h3><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">Panic Disorder</span></h3>
<p class="First">The effectiveness of paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> was evaluated in three 10 week, multicenter, flexible dose studies (Studies 1, 2 and 3) comparing paroxetine extended-release tablets (12.5 mg to 75 mg daily) to placebo in adult outpatients who had <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> (DSM-IV), with or without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4321835" conceptname="Agoraphobia">agoraphobia</span>. These trials were assessed on the basis of their outcomes on three variables: (1) the proportions of patients free of full <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021498" conceptname="Panic attack">panic attacks</span> at endpoint; (2) change from baseline to endpoint in the median number of full <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021498" conceptname="Panic attack">panic attacks</span>; and (3) change from baseline to endpoint in the median Clinical Global Impression Severity score. For Studies 1 and 2, paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets were consistently superior to placebo on 2 of these 3 variables. Study 3 failed to consistently demonstrate a significant difference between paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets and placebo on any of these variables. </p>
<p>For all three studies, the mean dose of paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets for completers at endpoint was approximately 50 mg/day. Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age or gender. </p>
<p>Long-term maintenance effects of the immediate-release formulation of paroxetine in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> were demonstrated in an extension study. Patients who were responders during a 10 week double-blind phase with immediate-release paroxetine and during a 3 month double-blind extension phase were randomized to either immediate-release paroxetine or placebo in a 3 month double-blind relapse prevention phase. Patients randomized to paroxetine were significantly less likely to relapse than comparably treated patients who were randomized to placebo. </p>

<h3><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">Social Anxiety Disorder</span></h3>
<p class="First">The efficacy of paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets as a treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span> has been established, in part, on the basis of extrapolation from the established effectiveness of the immediate-release formulation of paroxetine. In addition, the effectiveness of paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span> was demonstrated in a 12 week, multicenter, double-blind, flexible dose, placebo-controlled study of adult outpatients with a primary diagnosis of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span> (DSM-IV). In the study, the effectiveness of paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets (12.5 mg to 37.5 mg daily) compared to placebo was evaluated on the basis of (1) change from baseline in the Liebowitz Social <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">Anxiety</span> Scale (LSAS) total score and (2) the proportion of responders who scored 1 or 2 (very much improved or much improved) on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Global Improvement score. </p>
<p>Paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo on both the LSAS total score and the CGI Improvement responder criterion. For patients who completed the trial, 64% of patients treated with paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets compared to 34.7% of patients treated with placebo were CGI Improvement responders. </p>
<p>Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of gender.

<p class="First">The effectiveness of paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets for the treatment of PMDD utilizing a continuous dosing regimen has been established in two placebo-controlled trials. Patients in these trials met DSM-IV criteria for PMDD. In a pool of 1,030 patients, treated with daily doses of paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets 12.5 or 25 mg/day or placebo the mean duration of the PMDD symptoms was approximately 11 ± 7 years. Patients on systemic hormonal contraceptives were excluded from these trials. Therefore, the efficacy of paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets in combination with systemic (including oral) hormonal contraceptives for the continuous daily treatment of PMDD is unknown. In both positive studies, patients (n = 672) were treated with 12.5 mg/day or 25 mg/day of paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets or placebo continuously throughout the menstrual cycle for a period of 3 menstrual cycles. The VAS-Total score is a patient-rated instrument that mirrors the diagnostic criteria of PMDD as identified in the DSM-IV and includes assessments for mood, physical symptoms and other symptoms. 12.5 mg/day and 25 mg/day of paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets were significantly more effective than placebo as measured by change from baseline to the endpoint on the luteal phase VAS-Total score. </p>
<p>In a third study employing intermittent dosing, patients (n = 366) were treated for the 2 weeks prior to the onset of menses (luteal phase dosing, also known as intermittent dosing) with 12.5 mg/day or 25 mg/day of paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets or placebo for a period of 3 months. 12.5 mg/day and 25 mg/day of paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets, as luteal phase dosing, was significantly more effective than placebo as measured by change from baseline luteal phase VAS total score. </p>

There has been a longstanding concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.</p>
<p>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440374" conceptname="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">obsessive compulsive disorder</span> (OCD) or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of nine antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1,000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.</p>

<h2>Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder</h2>
<p class="First">A major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive episode</span> may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder.

<h3>Teratogenic Effects</h3>
<p class="First">Epidemiological studies have shown that infants exposed to paroxetine in the first trimester of pregnancy have an increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly cardiovascular malformations. The findings from these studies are summarized below: </p>
<ul>
<li>A study based on Swedish national registry data demonstrated that infants exposed to paroxetine during pregnancy (n = 815) had an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations (2% risk in paroxetine-exposed infants) compared to the entire registry population (1% risk), for an odds ratio (OR) of 1.8 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.8). No increase in the risk of overall congenital malformations was seen in the paroxetine-exposed infants. The cardiac malformations in the paroxetine-exposed infants were primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434462" conceptname="Ventricular septal defect">ventricular septal defects</span> (VSDs) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4289309" conceptname="Atrial septal defect">atrial septal defects</span> (ASDs). Septal defects range in severity from those that resolve spontaneously to those which require surgery. </li>
<li>A separate retrospective cohort study from the United States (United Healthcare data) evaluated 5,956 infants of mothers dispensed antidepressants during the first trimester (n = 815 for paroxetine). This study showed a trend towards an increased risk for cardiovascular malformations for paroxetine (risk of 1.5%) compared to other antidepressants (risk of 1%), for an OR of 1.5 (95% confidence interval 0.8 to 2.9). Of the 12 paroxetine-exposed infants with cardiovascular malformations, nine had VSDs. This study also suggested an increased risk of overall major congenital malformations including cardiovascular defects for paroxetine (4% risk) compared to other (2% risk) antidepressants (OR 1.8; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.8). </li>
<li>Two large case control studies using separate databases, each with &gt; 9,000 birth defect cases and &gt; 4,000 controls, found that maternal use of paroxetine during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of right ventricular outflow tract obstructions. In one study the OR was 2.5 (95% confidence interval, 1 to 6, seven exposed infants) and in the other study the OR was 3.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 8.8, six exposed infants). </li>
</ul>
<p>Other studies have found varying results as to whether there was an increased risk of overall, cardiovascular or specific congenital malformations. A meta-analysis of epidemiological data over a 16-year period (1992 to 2008) on first trimester paroxetine use in pregnancy and congenital malformations included the above-noted studies in addition to others (n = 17 studies that included overall malformations and n = 14 studies that included cardiovascular malformations; n = 20 distinct studies). While subject to limitations, this meta-analysis suggested an increased occurrence of cardiovascular malformations (prevalence odds ratio [POR] 1.5; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.9) and overall malformations (POR 1.2; 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 1.4) with paroxetine use during the first trimester. It was not possible in this meta-analysis to determine the extent to which the observed prevalence of cardiovascular malformations might have contributed to that of overall malformations, nor was it possible to determine whether any specific types of cardiovascular malformations might have contributed to the observed prevalence of all cardiovascular malformations. </p>
<p>If a patient becomes pregnant while taking paroxetine, she should be advised of the potential harm to the fetus. Unless the benefits of paroxetine to the mother justify continuing treatment, consideration should be given to either discontinuing paroxetine therapy or switching to another antidepressant (see <a href="#i4i_section_id_4bce2038-48bd-497b-9dbf-d3c9f3dbbb16">PRECAUTIONS: Discontinuation of Treatment with Paroxetine Hydrochloride Extended-release Tablets</a>). For women who intend to become pregnant or are in their first trimester of pregnancy, paroxetine should only be initiated after consideration of the other available treatment options.</p>

<h3>Animal Findings</h3>
<p class="First">Reproduction studies were performed at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day in rats and 6 mg/kg/day in rabbits administered during organogenesis. These doses are approximately 8 (rat) and 2 (rabbit) times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on an mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. These studies have revealed no evidence of teratogenic effects. However, in rats, there was an increase in pup <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> during the first 4 days of lactation when dosing occurred during the last trimester of gestation and continued throughout lactation. This effect occurred at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day or approximately one-sixth of the MRHD on an mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. The no effect dose for rat pup mortality was not determined. The cause of these <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> is not known. </p>

<h3>Nonteratogenic Effects</h3>
<p class="First">Neonates exposed to paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets and other SSRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4158346" conceptname="Respiratory distress">respiratory distress</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438555" conceptname="Cyanosis">cyanosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">hypotonia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208994" conceptname="Increased muscle tone">hypertonia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4313132" conceptname="Hyperreflexia">hyperreflexia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436817" conceptname="Feeling nervous">jitteriness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span> and constant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4136768" conceptname="Crying">crying</span>. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span> (see <a href="#i4i_section_id_f3968641-a17d-40a4-af8e-aa1b141d2644">WARNINGS: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">Serotonin Syndrome</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="379802" conceptname="Neuroleptic malignant syndrome">Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome</span> (NMS)-like Reactions</a>). </p>
<p>Infants exposed to SSRIs in late pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322024" conceptname="Pulmonary hypertension">pulmonary hypertension</span> of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. In a retrospective case control study of 377 women whose infants were born with PPHN and 836 women whose infants were born healthy, the risk for developing PPHN was approximately 6-fold higher for infants exposed to SSRIs after the 20<span class="Sup">th</span> week of gestation compared to infants who had not been exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. There is currently no corroborative evidence regarding the risk for PPHN following exposure to SSRIs in pregnancy; this is the first study that has investigated the potential risk. The study did not include enough cases with exposure to individual SSRIs to determine if all SSRIs posed similar levels of PPHN risk.</p>
<p>There have also been post-marketing reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439128" conceptname="Extreme immaturity">premature births</span> in pregnant women exposed to paroxetine or other SSRIs.</p>
<p>When treating a pregnant woman with paroxetine during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider both the potential risks and benefits of treatment (see <a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_01e63e2a-8f58-4340-94d7-0d290e013527">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>). Physicians should note that in a prospective longitudinal study of 201 women with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4114950" conceptname="Endogenous depression">major depression</span> who were euthymic at the beginning of pregnancy, women who discontinued antidepressant medication during pregnancy were more likely to experience a relapse of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4114950" conceptname="Endogenous depression">major depression</span> than women who continued antidepressant medication.</p>

<h3>Discontinuation of Treatment with Paroxetine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets</h3>
<p class="First">Adverse events while discontinuing therapy with paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets were not systematically evaluated in most clinical trials; however, in recent placebo-controlled clinical trials utilizing daily doses of paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets up to 37.5 mg/day, spontaneously reported adverse events while discontinuing therapy with paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets were evaluated. Patients receiving 37.5 mg/day underwent an incremental decrease in the daily dose by 12.5 mg/day to a dose of 25 mg/day for one week before treatment was stopped. For patients receiving 25 mg/day or 12.5 mg/day, treatment was stopped without an incremental decrease in dose. With this regimen in those studies, the following adverse events were reported for paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets, at an incidence of 2% or greater for paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets and were at least twice that reported for placebo: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">Dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436817" conceptname="Feeling nervous">nervousness</span> and additional symptoms described by the investigator as associated with tapering or discontinuing paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4078201" conceptname="Mood swings">emotional lability</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4193492" conceptname="Acroparesthesia">electric shock sensations</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435524" conceptname="Sleep disorder">sleep disturbances</span>). These events were reported as serious in 0.3% of patients who discontinued therapy with paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets. </p>
<p>During marketing of paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets and other SSRIs and SNRIs, there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, (particularly when abrupt), including the following: Dysphoric mood, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4311114" conceptname="Sensory disorder">sensory disturbances</span> (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4193492" conceptname="Acroparesthesia">paresthesias</span> such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4193492" conceptname="Acroparesthesia">electric shock sensations</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377575" conceptname="Tinnitus">tinnitus</span>), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4061577" conceptname="Lethargy">lethargy</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4078201" conceptname="Mood swings">emotional lability</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333678" conceptname="Hypomania">hypomania</span>. While these events are generally self limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms. </p>
<p>Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate (see <a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_01e63e2a-8f58-4340-94d7-0d290e013527">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>). </p>

<h3>Tamoxifen </h3>
<p class="First">Some studies have shown that the efficacy of tamoxifen, as measured by the risk of breast cancer relapse/mortality, may be reduced when co-prescribed with paroxetine as a result of paroxetine’s irreversible inhibition of CYP2D6 (see Drug Interactions). However, other studies have failed to demonstrate such a risk. It is uncertain whether the coadministration of paroxetine and tamoxifen has a significant adverse effect on the efficacy of tamoxifen. One study suggests that the risk may increase with longer duration of coadministration. When tamoxifen is used for the treatment or prevention of breast cancer, prescribers should consider using an alternative antidepressant with little or no CYP2D6 inhibition.</p>

<h3>Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness</h3>
<p class="First">Clinical experience with immediate-release paroxetine hydrochloride in patients with certain concomitant systemic illness is limited. Caution is advisable in using paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with diseases or conditions that could affect metabolism or hemodynamic responses. </p>
<p>As with other SSRIs, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4290615" conceptname="Dilated pupil">mydriasis</span> has been infrequently reported in premarketing studies with paroxetine hydrochloride. A few cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432312" conceptname="Chronic angle-closure glaucoma">acute angle closure glaucoma</span> associated with therapy with immediate-release paroxetine have been reported in the literature. As <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4290615" conceptname="Dilated pupil">mydriasis</span> can cause acute angle closure in patients with narrow angle <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437541" conceptname="Glaucoma">glaucoma</span>, caution should be used when paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets are prescribed for patients with narrow angle <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437541" conceptname="Glaucoma">glaucoma</span>. </p>
<p>Paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets or the immediate-release formulation has not been evaluated or used to any appreciable extent in patients with a recent history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> or unstable heart disease. Patients with these diagnoses were excluded from clinical studies during premarket testing. Evaluation of electrocardiograms of 682 patients who received immediate-release paroxetine hydrochloride in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, however, did not indicate that paroxetine is associated with the development of significant ECG abnormalities. Similarly, paroxetine hydrochloride does not cause any clinically important changes in heart rate or blood pressure. </p>
<p>Increased plasma concentrations of paroxetine occur in patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min.) or severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>. A lower starting dose should be used in such patients (see <a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_01e63e2a-8f58-4340-94d7-0d290e013527">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>). </p>

<p>Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with paroxetine and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about “Antidepressant Medicines, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> and other Serious Mental Illness and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions? is available for paroxetine. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. </p>
<p>Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking paroxetine.</p>

Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day to day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication.</p>

<h3>Tryptophan</h3>
<p class="First">As with other serotonin reuptake inhibitors, an interaction between paroxetine and tryptophan may occur when they are coadministered. Adverse experiences, consisting primarily of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, have been reported when tryptophan was administered to patients taking immediate-release paroxetine. Consequently, concomitant use of paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets with tryptophan is not recommended (see <a href="#i4i_section_id_f3968641-a17d-40a4-af8e-aa1b141d2644">WARNINGS: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">Serotonin Syndrome</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="379802" conceptname="Neuroleptic malignant syndrome">Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome</span> (NMS)-like Reactions</a>). </p>

<h3>Pimozide</h3>
<p class="First">In a controlled study of healthy volunteers, after immediate-release paroxetine hydrochloride was titrated to 60 mg daily, coadministration of a single-dose of 2 mg pimozide was associated with mean increases in pimozide AUC of 151% and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of 62%, compared to pimozide administered alone. The increase in pimozide AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> is due to the CYP2D6 inhibitory properties of paroxetine. Due to the narrow therapeutic index of pimozide and its known ability to prolong the QT interval, concomitant use of pimozide and paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated (see <a href="#i4i_contraindications_id_5be51dbe-870a-4d0e-964c-866e74cfa46c">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>). </p>

<h3>Cimetidine</h3>
<p class="First">Cimetidine inhibits many cytochrome P450 (oxidative) enzymes. In a study where immediate-release paroxetine (30 mg once daily) was dosed orally for 4 weeks, steady-state plasma concentrations of paroxetine were increased by approximately 50% during coadministration with oral cimetidine (300 mg three times daily) for the final week. Therefore, when these drugs are administered concurrently, dosage adjustment of paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets after the starting dose should be guided by clinical effect. The effect of paroxetine on cimetidine’s pharmacokinetics was not studied. </p>

<h3>Phenobarbital</h3>
<p class="First">Phenobarbital induces many cytochrome P<span class="Sub">450</span> (oxidative) enzymes. When a single oral 30 mg dose of immediate-release paroxetine was administered at phenobarbital steady-state (100 mg once daily for 14 days), paroxetine AUC and T<span class="Sub">½</span> were reduced (by an average of 25% and 38%, respectively) compared to paroxetine administered alone. The effect of paroxetine on phenobarbital pharmacokinetics was not studied. Since paroxetine exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics, the results of this study may not address the case where the two drugs are both being chronically dosed. No initial dosage adjustment with paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets is considered necessary when coadministered with phenobarbital; any subsequent adjustment should be guided by clinical effect. </p>

<h3>Phenytoin</h3>
<p class="First">When a single oral 30 mg dose of immediate-release paroxetine was administered at phenytoin steady-state (300 mg once daily for 14 days), paroxetine AUC and T<span class="Sub">½</span> were reduced (by an average of 50% and 35%, respectively) compared to immediate-release paroxetine administered alone. In a separate study, when a single oral 300 mg dose of phenytoin was administered at paroxetine steady-state (30 mg once daily for 14 days), phenytoin AUC was slightly reduced (12% on average) compared to phenytoin administered alone. Since both drugs exhibit nonlinear pharmacokinetics, the above studies may not address the case where the two drugs are both being chronically dosed. No initial dosage adjustments are considered necessary when paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets are coadministered with phenytoin; any subsequent adjustments should be guided by clinical effect (see <a href="#i4i_section_id_9c639c08-ddcd-4dc5-8c43-d19b9f9fbd56">ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-marketing Reports</a>).</p>

<h3>Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6</h3>
<p class="First">Many drugs, including most drugs effective in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (paroxetine, other SSRIs and many tricyclics), are metabolized by the cytochrome P<span class="Sub">450</span> isozyme CYP2D6. Like other agents that are metabolized by CYP2D6, paroxetine may significantly inhibit the activity of this isozyme. In most patients (&gt; 90%), this CYP2D6 isozyme is saturated early during paroxetine dosing. In one study, daily dosing of immediate-release paroxetine (20 mg once daily) under steady-state conditions increased single dose desipramine (100 mg) C<span class="Sub">max</span>, AUC and T<span class="Sub">½</span> by an average of approximately 2-, 5- and 3-fold, respectively. Concomitant use of paroxetine with risperidone, a CYP2D6 substrate has also been evaluated. In one study, daily dosing of paroxetine 20 mg in patients stabilized on risperidone (4 to 8 mg/day) increased mean plasma concentrations of risperidone approximately 4-fold, decreased 9-hydroxyrisperidone concentrations approximately 10% and increased concentrations of the active moiety (the sum of risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone) approximately 1.4-fold. The effect of paroxetine on the pharmacokinetics of atomoxetine has been evaluated when both drugs were at steady-state. In healthy volunteers who were extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6, paroxetine 20 mg daily was given in combination with 20 mg atomoxetine every 12 hours. This resulted in increases in steady-state atomoxetine AUC values that were 6- to 8-fold greater and in atomoxetine C<span class="Sub">max</span> values that were 3- to 4-fold greater than when atomoxetine was given alone. Dosage adjustment of atomoxetine may be necessary and it is recommended that atomoxetine be initiated at a reduced dose when given with paroxetine. </p>
<p>Concomitant use of paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets with other drugs metabolized by cytochrome CYP2D6 has not been formally studied but may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets or the other drug. </p>
<p>Therefore, coadministration of paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including certain drugs effective in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (e.g., nortriptyline, amitriptyline, imipramine, desipramine and fluoxetine), phenothiazines, risperidone and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide) or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution. </p>
<p>However, due to the risk of serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4132309" conceptname="Sudden death">sudden death</span> potentially associated with elevated plasma levels of thioridazine, paroxetine and thioridazine should not be coadministered (see <a href="#i4i_contraindications_id_5be51dbe-870a-4d0e-964c-866e74cfa46c">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a> and <a href="#i4i_warnings_id_332b8d0b-01c9-49f0-88fc-96ca5d3ceae6">WARNINGS</a>). </p>
<p>Tamoxifen is a prodrug requiring metabolic activation by CYP2D6. Inhibition of CYP2D6 by paroxetine may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of an active metabolite (endoxifen) and hence reduced efficacy of tamoxifen (see <a href="#i4i_precautions_id_29862187-0e3c-43df-90a4-51c6b4b8bf9c">PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>
<p>At steady-state, when the CYP2D6 pathway is essentially saturated, paroxetine clearance is governed by alternative P<span class="Sub">450</span> isozymes that, unlike CYP2D6, show no evidence of saturation (see <a href="#i4i_section_id_0506aa11-1407-4a7c-9f75-e25f2264e01c">PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions: Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)</a>). </p>

<h3>Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome CYP3A4</h3>
<p class="First">An <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> interaction study involving the coadministration under steady-state conditions of paroxetine and terfenadine, a substrate for CYP3A4, revealed no effect of paroxetine on terfenadine pharmacokinetics. In addition, <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies have shown ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity, to be at least 100 times more potent than paroxetine as an inhibitor of the metabolism of several substrates for this enzyme, including terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, triazolam and cyclosporine. Based on the assumption that the relationship between paroxetine’s <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> K<span class="Sub">i</span> and its lack of effect on terfenadine's <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> clearance predicts its effect on other CYP3A4 substrates, paroxetine’s extent of inhibition of CYP3A4 activity is not likely to be of clinical significance. </p>

<h3>Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)</h3>
<p class="First">Caution is indicated in the coadministration of TCAs with paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets, because paroxetine may inhibit TCA metabolism. Plasma TCA concentrations may need to be monitored and the dose of TCA may need to be reduced, if a TCA is coadministered with paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets (see <a href="#i4i_section_id_891f2d48-418d-45ef-8d3a-d60ce01b6c8e">PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions: Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome CYP2D6</a>). </p>

<h3>Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein</h3>
<p class="First">Because paroxetine is highly bound to plasma protein, administration of paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets to a patient taking another drug that is highly protein bound may cause increased free concentrations of the other drug, potentially resulting in adverse events. Conversely, adverse effects could result from displacement of paroxetine by other highly bound drugs. </p>

<h3>Impairment of Fertility</h3>
<p class="First">Some clinical studies have shown that SSRIs (including paroxetine) may affect sperm quality during SSRI treatment, which may affect fertility in some men.</p>
<p>A reduced pregnancy rate was found in reproduction studies in rats at a dose of paroxetine of 15 mg/kg/day, which is approximately twice the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. Irreversible lesions occurred in the reproductive tract of male rats after dosing in toxicity studies for 2 to 52 weeks. These lesions consisted of vacuolation of epididymal tubular epithelium at 50 mg/kg/day and atrophic changes in the seminiferous tubules of the testes with arrested spermatogenesis at 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 8 and 4 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). </p>

Table 6 enumerates adverse events that occurred at an incidence of 1% or more among patients treated with paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets who participated in three, 12-week, placebo-controlled trials in PMDD in which patients were dosed at 12.5 mg/day or 25 mg/day and in one 12-week placebo-controlled trial in which patients were dosed for 2 weeks prior to the onset of menses (luteal phase dosing) at 12.5 mg/day or 25 mg/day. Reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based Dictionary terminology. </p>
<p>The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side effect incidence rate in the population studied. </p>

<h3>Male and Female <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4237140" conceptname="Abnormal sexual function">Sexual Dysfunction</span> with SSRIs</h3>
<p class="First">Although changes in sexual desire, sexual performance and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder, they may also be a consequence of pharmacologic treatment. In particular, some evidence suggests that SSRIs can cause such untoward sexual experiences. </p>
<p>Reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance and satisfaction are difficult to obtain; however, in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in product labeling, are likely to underestimate their actual incidence. </p>

<h3>Liver Function Tests</h3>
<p class="First">In a pool of two placebo-controlled clinical trials, patients treated with paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets or placebo exhibited abnormal values on liver function tests at comparable rates. In particular, the extended-release paroxetine versus placebo comparisons for alkaline phosphatase, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4094657" conceptname="Aspartate aminotransferase">SGOT</span>, SGPT and bilirubin revealed no differences in the percentage of patients with marked abnormalities. </p>
<p>In a study of elderly patients with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, 3 of 104 patients treated with paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets and none of 109 placebo patients experienced liver transaminase elevations of potential clinical concern. </p>
<p>Two of the patients treated with paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets dropped out of the study due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438878" conceptname="Liver function tests abnormal">abnormal liver function tests</span>; the third patient experienced normalization of transaminase levels with continued treatment. Also, in the pool of three studies of patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span>, 4 of 444 patients treated with paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets and none of 445 placebo patients experienced liver transaminase elevations of potential clinical concern. Elevations in all four patients decreased substantially after discontinuation of paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. </p>
<p>In placebo-controlled clinical trials with the immediate-release formulation of paroxetine, patients exhibited abnormal values on liver function tests at no greater rate than that seen in placebo-treated patients. </p>

<h2>Other Events Observed During the Clinical Development of Paroxetine</h2>
<p class="First">The following adverse events were reported during the clinical development of paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets and/or the clinical development of the immediate-release formulation of paroxetine. </p>
<p>Adverse events for which frequencies are provided below occurred in clinical trials with the extended-release formulation of paroxetine. During its premarketing assessment in major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span> and PMDD, multiple doses of paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets were administered to 1,627 patients in phase three double-blind, controlled, outpatient studies. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. </p>
<p>In the tabulations that follow, reported adverse events were classified using a COSTART based dictionary. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 1,627 patients exposed to paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in Tables 2 through 7 and those events where a drug cause was remote. If the COSTART term for an event was so general as to be uninformative, it was deleted or, when possible, replaced with a more informative term. It is important to emphasize that although the events reported occurred during treatment with paroxetine, they were not necessarily caused by it. </p>
<p>Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: Frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled trials appear in this listing); infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. </p>
<p>Adverse events for which frequencies are not provided occurred during the premarketing assessment of immediate-release paroxetine in phase two and three studies of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440374" conceptname="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">obsessive compulsive disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434613" conceptname="Generalized anxiety disorder">generalized anxiety disorder</span> and posttraumatic stress disorder. The conditions and duration of exposure to immediate-release paroxetine varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) open and double-blind studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies and fixed dose and titration studies. Only those events not previously listed for extended-release paroxetine are included. The extent to which these events may be associated with paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets is unknown. </p>
<p>Events are listed alphabetically within the respective body system. Events of major clinical importance are also described in the <a href="#i4i_precautions_id_29862187-0e3c-43df-90a4-51c6b4b8bf9c">PRECAUTIONS</a> section. </p>

<h2>Human Experience</h2>
<p class="First">Since the introduction of immediate-release paroxetine hydrochloride in the United States, 342 spontaneous cases of deliberate or accidental overdosage during paroxetine treatment have been reported worldwide (circa 1999). These include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> with paroxetine alone and in combination with other substances. Of these, 48 cases were fatal and of the fatalities, 17 appeared to involve paroxetine alone. Eight fatal cases that documented the amount of paroxetine ingested were generally confounded by the ingestion of other drugs or alcohol or the presence of significant comorbid conditions. Of 145 nonfatal cases with known outcome, most recovered without sequelae.

<h2>Overdosage Management</h2>
<p class="First">No specific antidotes for paroxetine are known. Treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any drugs effective in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>. </p>
<p>Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. General supportive and symptomatic measures are also recommended. Induction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> is not recommended. Due to the large volume of distribution of this drug, forced diruesis, dialysis, hemoperfusion or exchange perfusion are unlikely to be of benefit.</p>
<p>A specific caution involves patients taking or recently having taken paroxetine who might ingest excessive quantities of a tricyclic antidepressant. In such a case, accumulation of the parent tricyclic and an active metabolite may increase the possibility of clinically significant sequelae and extend the time needed for close medical observation (see <a href="#i4i_section_id_891f2d48-418d-45ef-8d3a-d60ce01b6c8e">PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions: Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome CPY2D6</a>). </p>
<p>In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement. The physician should consider contacting a poison control center for additional information on the treatment of any <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. Telephone numbers for certified poison control centers are listed in the <span class="Italics">Physicians' Desk Reference </span>(PDR). </p>

<h3>Usual Initial Dosage</h3>
<p class="First">Paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be administered as a single daily dose, usually in the morning, with or without food. The recommended initial dose is 25 mg/day. Patients were dosed in a range of 25 mg to 62.5 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>. As with all drugs effective in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, the full effect may be delayed. Some patients not responding to a 25 mg dose may benefit from dose increases, in 12.5 mg/day increments, up to a maximum of 62.5 mg/day. Dose changes should occur at intervals of at least one week. </p>
<p>Patients should be cautioned that paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be chewed or crushed and should be swallowed whole. </p>

<h3>Maintenance Therapy</h3>
<p class="First">There is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets should remain on it. It is generally agreed that acute episodes of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> require several months or longer of sustained pharmacologic therapy. Whether the dose of an antidepressant needed to induce remission is identical to the dose needed to maintain and/or sustain euthymia is unknown. </p>
<p>Systematic evaluation of the efficacy of immediate-release paroxetine hydrochloride has shown that efficacy is maintained for periods of up to one year with doses that averaged about 30 mg, which corresponds to a 37.5 mg dose of paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets, based on relative bioavailability considerations (see <a href="#i4i_clinical_pharmacology_id_d7db97e2-7806-4918-81c8-386fc5fc70f3">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>). </p>

<h3>Usual Initial Dosage</h3>
<p class="First">Paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be administered as a single daily dose, usually in the morning. Patients should be started on 12.5 mg/day. Dose changes should occur in 12.5 mg/day increments and at intervals of at least one week. Patients were dosed in a range of 12.5 to 75 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets.

<h3>Maintenance Therapy</h3>
<p class="First">Long-term maintenance of efficacy with the immediate-release formulation of paroxetine was demonstrated in a 3 month relapse prevention trial. In this trial, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> assigned to immediate-release paroxetine demonstrated a lower relapse rate compared to patients on placebo. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">Panic disorder</span> is a chronic condition and it is reasonable to consider continuation for a responding patient.

<h3>Usual Initial Dosage</h3>
<p class="First">Paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be administered as a single daily dose, usually in the morning, with or without food.

<h3>Treatment of Pregnant Women During the Third Trimester</h3>
<p class="First">Neonates exposed to paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets and other SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support and tube feeding (see <a href="#i4i_section_id_6da01a11-9fd1-491c-8dda-3bd7854818cc">WARNINGS: Usage in Pregnancy</a>). When treating pregnant women with paroxetine during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment. The physician may consider tapering paroxetine in the third trimester. </p>

<h2>Discontinuation of Treatment with Paroxetine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets</h2>
<p class="First">Symptoms associated with discontinuation of immediate-release paroxetine hydrochloride or paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets have been reported (see <a href="#i4i_section_id_4bce2038-48bd-497b-9dbf-d3c9f3dbbb16">PRECAUTIONS: General: Discontinuation of Treatment with Paroxetine Hydrochloride Extended-release Tablets</a>). Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment, regardless of the indication for which paroxetine hydrochloride extended-release tablets are being prescribed. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate. </p>
