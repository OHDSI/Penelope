<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Ancobon (flucytosine), an antifungal agent, is available as 250 mg and 500 mg capsules for oral administration. Each capsule also contains corn starch, lactose and talc. Gelatin capsule shells contain parabens (butyl, methyl, propyl) and sodium propionate, with the following dye systems: 250 mg capsules â€” black iron oxide, FD&amp;C Blue No. 1, FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6, D&amp;C Yellow No. 10 and titanium dioxide; 500 mg capsules â€” black iron oxide and titanium dioxide. Chemically, flucytosine is 5-fluorocytosine, a fluorinated pyrimidine which is related to fluorouracil and floxuridine. It is a white to off-white crystalline powder with a molecular weight of 129.09 and the following structural formula:</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Flucytosine is rapidly and virtually completely absorbed following oral administration. Ancobon is not metabolized significantly when given orally to man. Bioavailability estimated by comparing the area under the curve of serum concentrations after oral and intravenous administration showed 78% to 89% absorption of the oral dose. Peak serum concentrations of 30 to 40 Âµg/mL were reached within 2 hours of administration of a 2 g oral dose to normal subjects. Other studies revealed mean serum concentrations of approximately 70 to 80 Î¼g/mL 1 to 2 hours after a dose in patients with normal renal function receiving a 6-week regimen of flucytosine (150 mg/kg/day given in divided doses every 6 hours) in combination with amphotericin B. The half-life in the majority of healthy subjects ranged between 2.4 and 4.8 hours. Flucytosine is excreted via the kidneys by means of glomerular filtration without significant tubular reabsorption. More than 90% of the total radioactivity after oral administration was recovered in the urine as intact drug. Flucytosine is deaminated (probably by gut bacteria) to 5-fluorouracil. The area under the curve (AUC) ratio of 5-fluorouracil to flucytosine is 4%. Approximately 1% of the dose is present in the urine as the Î±-fluoro-Î²-ureido-propionic acid metabolite. A small portion of the dose is excreted in the feces.</p>
<p>The half-life of flucytosine is prolonged in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>; the average half-life in nephrectomized or anuric patients was 85 hours (range: 29.9 to 250 hours). A linear correlation was found between the elimination rate constant of flucytosine and creatinine clearance.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies have shown that 2.9% to 4% of flucytosine is protein-bound over the range of therapeutic concentrations found in the blood. Flucytosine readily penetrates the blood-brain barrier, achieving clinically significant concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics in Pediatric Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Limited data are available regarding the pharmacokinetics of Ancobon administered to neonatal patients being treated for systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433968" conceptname="Candidiasis">candidiasis</span>. After five days of continuous therapy, median peak levels in infants were 19.6 Âµg/mL, 27.7 Âµg/mL, and 83.9 Âµg/mL at doses of 25 mg/kg (N=3), 50 mg/kg (N=4), and 100 mg/kg (N=3), respectively. Mean time to peak serum levels was of 2.5 Â± 1.3 hours, similar to that observed in adult patients. A good deal of interindividual variability was noted, which did not correlate with gestational age. Some patients had serum levels &gt; 100 Âµg/mL, suggesting a need for drug level monitoring during therapy. In another study, serum concentrations were determined during flucytosine therapy in two patients (total assays performed =10). Median serum flucytosine concentrations at steady state were calculated to be 57 Â± 10 Âµg/mL (doses of 50 to 125 mg/kg/day, normalized to 25 mg/kg per dose for comparison). In three infants receiving flucytosine 25 mg/kg/day (four divided doses), a median flucytosine half-life of 7.4 hours was observed, approximately double that seen in adult patients. The concentration of flucytosine in the cerebrospinal fluid of one infant was 43 Âµg/mL 3 hours after a 25 mg oral dose, and ranged from 20 to 67 mg/L in another neonate receiving oral doses of 120 to 150 mg/kg/day.</p>

<h2>MICROBIOLOGY</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></p>
<p>Flucytosine is taken up by fungal organisms via the enzyme cytosine permease. Inside the fungal cell, flucytosine is rapidly converted to fluorouracil by the enzyme cytosine deaminase. Fluorouracil exerts its antifungal activity through the subsequent conversion into several active metabolites, which inhibit protein synthesis by being falsely incorporated into fungal RNA or interfere with the biosynthesis of fungal DNA through the inhibition of the enzyme thymidylate synthetase.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Activity In Vitro</span></p>
<p>Flucytosine has been shown to be active against most <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of the following microorganisms <span class="Bold">both </span><span class="Bold Italics">in vitro</span><span class="Bold"> and in clinical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span>.</span></p>

<p>A report of â€œSusceptibleâ€? indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentration usually achievable. A report of "Intermediate" indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where a high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of "Resistant" indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentration usually achievable; other therapy should be selected. Because of other significant host factors, <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> susceptibility may not correlate with clinical outcomes.</p>
<p>Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Standard flucytosine powder should provide the range of MIC values noted in Table 2. NOTE: Quality control microorganisms are specific <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of organisms with intrinsic biological properties relating to resistance mechanisms and their genetic expression within fungi; the specific <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> used for microbiological control are not clinically significant.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4150981" conceptname="Drug resistance">Drug Resistance</span></h2>
<p class="First">Flucytosine resistance may arise from a mutation of an enzyme necessary for the cellular uptake or metabolism of flucytosine or from an increased synthesis of pyrimidines, which compete with the active metabolites of flucytosine (fluorinated antimetabolites). Resistance to flucytosine has been shown to develop during monotherapy after prolonged exposure to the drug.</p>

<h2>Drug Combination</h2>
<p class="First">Antifungal synergism between flucytosine and polyene antibiotics, particularly amphotericin B has been reported <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>.

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First">Ancobon must be given with extreme caution to patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>. Since Ancobon is excreted primarily by the kidneys, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> may lead to accumulation of the drug. Ancobon serum concentrations should be monitored to determine the adequacy of renal excretion in such patients. Dosage adjustments should be made in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> to prevent progressive accumulation of active drug.</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34072-9">
<a name="section-6.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Before therapy with Ancobon is instituted, electrolytes (because of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>) and the hematologic and renal status of the patient should be determined (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#AC0E3588-EC5F-4E36-9317-5711EB78591B">WARNINGS</a></span>). Close monitoring of the patient during therapy is essential.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34075-2">
<a name="section-6.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">Since <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> can cause progressive accumulation of the drug, blood concentrations and kidney function should be monitored during therapy. Hematologic status (leucocyte and thrombocyte count) and liver function (alkaline phosphatase, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4094657" conceptname="Aspartate aminotransferase">SGOT</span> and SGPT) should be determined at frequent intervals during treatment as indicated.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34073-7">
<a name="section-6.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Cytosine arabinoside, a cytostatic agent, has been reported to inactivate the antifungal activity of Ancobon by competitive inhibition. Drugs which impair glomerular filtration may prolong the biological half-life of flucytosine.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34074-5">
<a name="section-6.4"></a><p></p>
<h2>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Measurement of serum creatinine levels should be determined by the JaffÃ© reaction, since Ancobon does not interfere with the determination of creatinine values by this method. Most automated equipment for measurement of creatinine makes use of the JaffÃ© reaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34083-6">
<a name="section-6.5"></a><p></p>
<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Flucytosine has not undergone adequate animal testing to evaluate carcinogenic potential. The mutagenic potential of flucytosine was evaluated in Ames-type studies with five different mutants of <span class="Italics">S. typhimurium</span> and no mutagenicity was detected in the presence or absence of activating enzymes. Flucytosine was nonmutagenic in three different repair assay systems (i.e., rec, uvr and pol).</p>
<p>There have been no adequate trials in animals on the effects of flucytosine on fertility or reproductive performance. The fertility and reproductive performance of the offspring (F<span class="Sub">1</span> generation) of mice treated with 100 mg/kg/day (345 mg/M<span class="Sup">2</span>/day or 0.059 times the human dose), 200 mg/kg/day (690 mg/M<span class="Sup">2</span>/day or 0.118 times the human dose) or 400 mg/kg/day (1380 mg/M<span class="Sup">2</span>/day or 0.236 times the human dose) of flucytosine on days 7 to 13 of gestation was studied; the <span class="Italics">in utero </span>treatment had no adverse effect on the fertility or reproductive performance of the offspring.</p>

<h2>Pregnancy</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category C</span></p>
<p>Flucytosine was shown to be teratogenic (vertebral fusions) in the rat at doses of 40 mg/kg/day (298 mg/M<span class="Sup">2</span>/day or 0.051 times the human dose) administered on days 7 to 13 of gestation. At higher doses (700 mg/kg/day; 5208 mg/M<span class="Sup">2</span>/day or 0.89 times the human dose administered on days 9 to 12 of gestation), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134144" conceptname="Cleft palate with cleft lip">cleft lip and palate</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4140216" conceptname="Congenital micrognathism">micrognathia</span> were reported. Flucytosine was not teratogenic in rabbits up to a dose of 100 mg/kg/day (1423 mg/M<span class="Sup">2</span>/day or 0.243 times the human dose) administered on days 6 to 18 of gestation. In mice, 400 mg/kg/day of flucytosine (1380 mg/M<span class="Sup">2</span>/day or 0.236 times the human dose) administered on days 7 to 13 of gestation was associated with a low incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135923" conceptname="Cleft palate">cleft palate</span> that was not statistically significant. Studies in pregnant rats have shown that flucytosine injected intraperitoneally crosses the placental barrier. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ancobon should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Ancobon, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">The efficacy and safety of Ancobon have not been systematically studied in pediatric patients.

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">There is no experience with intentional overdosage. It is reasonable to expect that overdosage may produce pronounced manifestations of the known clinical adverse reactions. Prolonged serum concentrations in excess of 100 Âµg/mL may be associated with an increased incidence of toxicity, especially gastrointestinal (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>), hematologic (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435224" conceptname="Leukopenia">leukopenia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span>) and hepatic (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span>).</p>
<p>In the management of overdosage, prompt gastric lavage or the use of an emetic is recommended. Adequate fluid intake should be maintained, by the intravenous route if necessary, since Ancobon is excreted unchanged via the renal tract. The hematologic parameters should be monitored frequently; liver and kidney function should be carefully monitored. Should any abnormalities appear in any of these parameters, appropriate therapeutic measures should be instituted.</p>
<p>Since hemodialysis has been shown to rapidly reduce serum concentrations in anuric patients, this method may be considered in the management of overdosage.</p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34068-7">

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">The usual dosage of Ancobon is 50 to 150 mg/kg/day administered in divided doses at 6-hour intervals. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">Nausea</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> may be reduced or avoided if the capsules are given a few at a time over a 15-minute period. If the BUN or the serum creatinine is elevated, or if there are other signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, the initial dose should be at the lower level (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#AC0E3588-EC5F-4E36-9317-5711EB78591B">WARNINGS</a></span>).</p>
<p>Ancobon should be used in combination with amphotericin B for the treatment of systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433968" conceptname="Candidiasis">candidiasis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440035" conceptname="Cryptococcosis">cryptococcosis</span> because of the emergence of resistance to Ancobon (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#A7DDC1EB-3487-4988-8A13-0999E03D39CA">MICROBIOLOGY</a></span>).</p>
