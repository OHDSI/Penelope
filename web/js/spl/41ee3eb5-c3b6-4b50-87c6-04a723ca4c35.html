<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>pHisoHex, brand of hexachlorophene detergent cleanser, is an antibacterial sudsing emulsion for topical administration.  pHisoHex contains a colloidal dispersion of hexachlorophene 3% (w/w) in a stable emulsion consisting of entsufon sodium, petrolatum, lanolin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterols</span>, methylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol monostearate, lauryl myristyl diethanolamide, sodium benzoate, and water.  pH is adjusted with hydrochloric acid.  Entsufon sodium is a synthetic detergent.</p>
<p>Chemically, hexachlorophene is Phenol, 2,2'-methylenebis[3,4,6-trichloro-; and has the following structural formula:</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>pHisoHex is a bacteriostatic cleansing agent.  It cleanses the skin thoroughly and has bacteriostatic action against staphylococci and other gram-positive bacteria.  Cumulative antibacterial action develops with repeated use. Cleansing with alcohol or soaps containing alcohol removes the antibacterial residue.</p>
<p>Detectable blood levels of hexachlorophene following absorption through intact skin have been found in subjects who regularly scrubbed with hexachlorophene emulsion 3%.  (See <a href="#Warn">WARNINGS</a> for additional information.)</p>
<p>pHisoHex has the same slight acidity as normal skin (pH value 5.0 to 6.0).</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS &amp; USAGE</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>pHisoHex is indicated for use as a surgical scrub and a bacteriostatic skin cleanser.  It may also be used to control an outbreak of gram-positive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> where other <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> control procedures have been unsuccessful.  Use only as long as necessary for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> control (see <a href="#Information">PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients</a>). </p>

<h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>pHisoHex must not be used on burned or denuded skin.</p>
<p>pHisoHex must not be used for bathing infants (see <a href="#Warn">WARNINGS</a>).  Infants may absorb the active compound in pHisoHex more readily than older children and adults.  Such absorption has been associated with central nervous system effects such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>.</p>
<p>It must not be used as an occlusive dressing, wetpack, or lotion.  It must not be used routinely for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118659" conceptname="Prophylactic">prophylactic</span> total body bathing.</p>
<p>It must not be used as a vaginal pack or tampon, or on any mucous membranes.</p>
<p>pHisoHex must not be used on persons with sensitivity to any of its components.  It must not be used on persons who have demonstrated primary light sensitivity to halogenated phenol derivatives because of the possibility of cross-sensitivity to hexachlorophene.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p><span class="Bold">RINSE THOROUGHLY AFTER EACH USE.</span>  Patients should be closely monitored and use should be immediately discontinued at the first sign of any of the symptoms described below.</p>
<p>Rapid absorption of hexachlorophene may occur with resultant toxic blood levels when preparations containing hexachlorophene are applied to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4316083" conceptname="Skin lesion">skin lesions</span> such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134743" conceptname="Congenital ichthyosis of skin">ichthyosis congenita</span>, the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133835" conceptname="Eczema">dermatitis</span> of Letterer-Siwe's syndrome, or other generalized dermatological conditions.  Application to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022094" conceptname="Thermal burn">burns</span> has also produced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4024301" conceptname="Neurotoxicity">neurotoxicity</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">pHisoHex SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED PROMPTLY IF SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF CEREBRAL <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">IRRITABILITY</span> OCCUR.</span></p>
<p>Infants, especially premature infants or those with dermatoses, are particularly susceptible to hexachlorophene absorption.  Systemic toxicity may be manifested by signs of stimulation (irritation) of the central nervous system, sometimes with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>.</p>
<p>Infants have developed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133835" conceptname="Eczema">dermatitis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, generalized clonic muscular contractions and decerebrate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4050941" conceptname="Muscle rigidity">rigidity</span> following application of a 6 percent hexachlorophene powder.  Examination of brainstems of those infants revealed vacuolization like that which can be produced in newborn experimental animals following repeated topical application of 3 percent hexachlorophene.   Moreover, a study of histologic sections of premature infants who died of unrelated causes has shown a positive correlation between hexachlorophene baths and lesions in white matter of brains.</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Avoid accidental contact of pHisoHex with the eyes.</p>
<p>If contact occurs, promptly rinse thoroughly with water.  To assist in the detection of ocular irritation, applications to the head and periorbital skin areas should be performed only in responsive patients with unanesthetized eyes.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">RINSE THOROUGHLY AFTER USE,</span> especially from sensitive areas such as the scrotum and perineum.</p>
<p>pHisoHex is intended for external use only.  If swallowed, pHisoHex is harmful, especially to infants and children.  <span class="Bold">pHisoHex should not be poured into measuring cups, medicine bottles, or similar containers since it may be mistaken for baby formula or other medications.</span></p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Italics">The prescribing physician is requested to inform the patient about the following precautionary measures:</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">pHisoHex must not be used on burned or denuded skin. Application to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022094" conceptname="Thermal burn">burns</span> has produced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4024301" conceptname="Neurotoxicity">neurotoxicity</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.</span></p>

<p><span class="Bold">pHisoHex must not be used on persons who have demonstrated primary light sensitivity to halogenated phenol derivatives because of the possibility of cross-sensitivity to hexachlorophene.</span></p>
<p>pHisoHex should be kept out of the eyes.  If contact occurs, the patient should rinse with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">cold</span> water as soon as possible and contact a physician.</p>
<p>pHisoHex should not be used in sensitive areas such as the scrotum and perineum.  If contact occurs, these areas should be rinsed thoroughly.</p>
<p>pHisoHex is for external use only.</p>
<p>If pHisoHex is inadvertently swallowed (see <a href="#OVERDOSAGE">OVERDOSAGE</a>), the patient should contact a physician or Poison Control Center as soon as possible.</p>
<p>pHisoHex should not be poured into measuring cups, medicine bottles, or similar containers since it may be mistaken for baby formula or other medications.</p>
<p>pHisoHex should be stopped and a physician should be contacted if irritation, sensitization, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergic reaction</span> occurs.</p>
<p>pHisoHex should be used in pregnant women or nursing mothers only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus or infant.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hexachlorophene was tested in one experiment in rats by oral administration; it had no carcinogenic effect.</p>
<p>Hexachlorophene was not mutagenic in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span> typhimurium and was negative in a dominant lethal assay in male mice.  Cytogenetic tests with cultured human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span> were also negative.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>No case reports or epidemiological studies were available.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Topical exposure of neonatal rats to 3% hexachlorophene solution caused reduced fertility in 7-month-old males, due to inability to ejaculate.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Placental transfer of hexachlorophene has been demonstrated in rats.</p>
<p>Hexachlorophene is embryotoxic and produces some teratogenic effects.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Pregnancy Category C</span></p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.  Hexachlorophene should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<p>Hexachlorophene has been shown to be teratogenic and embryotoxic in rats when given by mouth or instilled into the vagina in large doses.</p>
<p>Administration of 500 mg/kg diet or 20 to 30 mg/kg bw/day by gavage to rats caused some malformations (angulated ribs, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135923" conceptname="Cleft palate">cleft palate</span>, micro- and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434143" conceptname="Anophthalmos">anophthalmia</span>) and reduction in litter size.</p>
<p>Placental transfer and excretion in milk of hexachlorophene has been demonstrated in rats.</p>
<p>In another study, doses of up to 50 mg/kg diet failed to produce any effects in 3 generations of rats.   Hexachlorophene did not interfere with reproduction in hamsters.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk.  Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from hexachlorophene, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>pHisoHex must not be used for bathing infants (see WARNINGS).  Infants may absorb the active compound in pHisoHex more readily than older children and adults.  Such absorption has been associated with central nervous system effects such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>. For premature infants:  see <a href="#Warn">WARNINGS</a>.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Clinical studies of pHisoHex did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.  Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients.  In general, use in elderly patients should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of dermatological disease, peripheral circulatory disease, and decreased propensity for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029919" conceptname="Wound">wound</span> healing in this group.  In addition, use in elderly patients should take into account any decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, as well as any concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>
