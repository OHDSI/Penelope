<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Mechanism of action:</span></span> Lidocaine stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the
ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses,
thereby effecting local anesthetic action. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Hemodynamics:</span></span> Excessive blood levels may cause changes in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span>,
total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. With central
neural blockade these changes may be attributable to block of autonomic
fibers, a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on
various components of the cardiovascular system and/or the
beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when present.
The net effect is normally a modest <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> when the recommended
dosages are not exceeded.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Pharmacokinetics and
metabolism:</span></span> Information derived from diverse formulations, concentrations
and usages reveals that lidocaine is completely absorbed following
parenteral administration, its rate of absorption depending, for
example, upon various factors such as the site of administration and the
presence or absence of a vasoconstrictor agent. Except for intravascular
administration, the highest blood levels are obtained following
intercostal nerve block and the lowest after subcutaneous
administration.</p>
<p>The plasma binding of lidocaine is dependent on drug
concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing
concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 Âµg of free base per
mL, 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine is protein bound. Binding is also
dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein.</p>
<p>Lidocaine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers,
presumably by passive diffusion.</p>
<p>Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites
and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation
includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the
amide linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of
biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and
glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these
metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine.
Approximately 90% of lidocaine administered is excreted in the
form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted
unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of
4-hydroxy-2, 6-dimethylaniline.</p>
<p>The elimination half-life of lidocaine following an intravenous
bolus injection is typically 1.5 to 2.0 hours. Because of the rapid rate
at which lidocaine is metabolized, any condition that affects liver
function may alter lidocaine kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged
two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction
does not affect lidocaine kinetics but may increase the accumulation of
metabolites.</p>
<p>Factors such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidosis</span> and the use of CNS stimulants and
depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine required to produce overt
systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly
apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6.0 Âµg free
base per mL. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18-21
Âµg/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive
activity.</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS &amp; USAGE</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Lidocaine Hydrochloride and Epinephrine Injection, USP is
indicated for production of local or regional anesthesia by infiltration
techniques such as percutaneous injection, by peripheral nerve block
techniques such as brachial plexus and intercostal and by central neural
techniques such as lumbar and caudal epidural blocks, when the accepted
procedures for these techniques as described in standard textbooks are
observed.</p>

<h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Lidocaine is contraindicated in patients with a known history of
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> to local anesthetics of the amide type.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>LIDOCAINE HYDROCHLORIDE AND EPINEPHRINE INJECTION, USP FOR
INFILTRATION AND NERVE BLOCK SHOULD BE EMPLOYED ONLY BY CLINICIANS WHO
ARE WELL VERSED IN DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF DOSE-RELATED TOXICITY AND
OTHER ACUTE EMERGENCIES THAT MIGHT ARISE FROM THE BLOCK TO BE EMPLOYED
AND THEN ONLY AFTER ENSURING THE <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">IMMEDIATE</span></span> AVAILABILITY OF OXYGEN, OTHER RESUSCITATIVE DRUGS,
CARDIOPULMONARY EQUIPMENT, AND THE PERSONNEL NEEDED FOR PROPER
MANAGEMENT OF TOXIC REACTIONS AND RELATED EMERGENCIES (See also <span><span class="Emphasis">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span></span> and <span><span class="Emphasis">PRECAUTIONS</span></span>). DELAY IN PROPER MANAGEMENT OF DOSE-RELATED TOXICITY,
UNDERVENTILATION FROM ANY CAUSE AND/OR ALTERED SENSITIVITY MAY LEAD TO
THE DEVELOPMENT OF <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">ACIDOSIS</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">CARDIAC ARREST</span> AND, POSSIBLY, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">DEATH</span>. </p>
<p>Intra-articular infusions of local anesthetics following
arthroscopic and other surgical procedures is an unapproved use, and
there have been post-marketing reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span> in patients
receiving such infusions. The majority of reported cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span>
have involved the shoulder joint; cases of gleno-humeral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span>
have been described in pediatric and adult patients following
intra-articular infusions of local anesthetics with and without
epinephrine for periods of 48 to 72 hours. There is insufficient
information to determine whether shorter infusion periods are not
associated with these findings. The time of onset of symptoms, such as
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77074" conceptname="Joint pain">joint pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4060220" conceptname="Stiff neck">stiffness</span> and loss of motion can be variable, but may begin
as early as the 2nd month after surgery. Currently, there is no
effective treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span>; patients who experienced
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span> have required additional diagnostic and therapeutic
procedures and some required arthroplasty or shoulder replacement.</p>
<p>To avoid intravascular injection, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span> should be performed
before the local anesthetic solution is injected. The needle must be
repositioned until no return of blood can be elicited by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span>.
Note, however, that the absence of blood in the syringe does not
guarantee that intravascular injection has been avoided.</p>
<p>Local anesthetic solutions containing antimicrobial
preservativesÂ  (e.g., methylparaben) should not be used for
epidural or spinal anesthesia because the safety of these agents has not
been established with regard to intrathecal injection, either
intentional or accidental.</p>
<p>Lidocaine Hydrochloride and Epinephrine Injection contains sodium
metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions
including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatic</span> episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence
of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably
low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatic</span> than in
nonasthmatic people.</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">General:</span></span> The safety and effectiveness of lidocaine depend on proper
dosage, correct technique, adequate precautions, and readiness for
emergencies. Standard textbooks should be consulted for specific
techniques and precautions for various regional anesthetic procedures. </p>
<p>Resuscitative equipment, oxygen, and other resuscitative drugs
should be available for immediate use. (See <span><span class="Emphasis">WARNINGS</span></span> and <span><span class="Emphasis">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span></span>). The lowest dosage that results in effective anesthesia
should be used to avoid high plasma levels and serious adverse effects.
Syringe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspirations</span> should also be performed before and during each
supplemental injection when using indwelling catheter techniques. During
the administration of epidural anesthesia, it is recommended that a test
dose be administered initially and that the patient be monitored for
central nervous system toxicity and cardiovascular toxicity, as well as
for signs of unintended intrathecal administration before proceeding.
When clinical conditions permit, consideration should be given to
employing local anesthetic solutions that contain epinephrine for the
test dose because circulatory changes compatible with epinephrine may
also serve as a warning sign of unintended intravascular injection. An
intravascular injection is still possible even if <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspirations</span> for blood
are negative. Repeated doses of lidocaine may cause significant
increases in blood levels with each repeated dose because of slow
accumulation of the drug or its metabolites. Tolerance to elevated blood
levels varies with the status of the patient. Debilitated, elderly
patients, acutely ill patients and children should be given reduced
doses commensurate with their age and physical condition. Lidocaine
should also be used with caution in patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span> or heart
block.</p>
<p>Lumbar and caudal epidural anesthesia should be used with extreme
caution in persons with the following conditions: existing neurological
disease, spinal deformities, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="132797" conceptname="Sepsis">septicemia</span> and severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>.</p>
<p>Local anesthetic solutions containing a vasoconstrictor should be
used cautiously and in carefully circumscribed quantities in areas of
the body supplied by end arteries or having otherwise compromised blood
supply. Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321052" conceptname="Peripheral vascular disease">peripheral vascular disease</span> and those with
hypertensive vascular disease may exhibit exaggerated vasoconstrictor
response. Ischemic injury or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280654" conceptname="Necrosis">necrosis</span> may result. Preparations
containing a vasoconstrictor should be used with caution in patients
during or following the administration of potent general anesthetic
agents, since <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmias</span> may occur under such conditions.</p>
<p>Careful and constant monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory
(adequacy of ventilation) vital signs and the patientâ€™s state
of consciousness should be accomplished after each local anesthetic
injection. It should be kept in mind at such times that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">restlessness</span>,
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377575" conceptname="Tinnitus">tinnitus</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079185" conceptname="Hazy vision">blurred vision</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremors</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> or
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> may be early warning signs of central nervous system
toxicity.</p>
<p>Since amide-type local anesthetics are metabolized by the liver,
lidocaine injection should be used with caution in patients with hepatic
disease. Patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span> because of their inability
to metabolize local anesthetics normally, are a greater risk of
developing toxic plasma concentrations. Lidocaine should also be used
with caution in patients with impaired cardiovascular function since
they may be less able to compensate for functional changes associated
with the prolongation of A-V conduction produced by these drugs.</p>
<p>Many drugs used during the conduct of anesthesia are considered
potential triggering agents for familial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440285" conceptname="Malignant hyperthermia">malignant hyperthermia</span>. Since
it is not known whether amide-type local anesthetics may trigger this
reaction and since the need for supplemental general anesthesia cannot
be predicted in advance, it is suggested that a standard protocol for
the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440285" conceptname="Malignant hyperthermia">malignant hyperthermia</span> should be available. Early
unexplained signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317376" conceptname="Tachypnea">tachypnea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4354255" conceptname="Labile blood pressure">labile blood pressure</span> and
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span> may precede temperature elevation. Successful outcome
is dependent on early diagnosis, prompt discontinuance of the suspect
triggering agent(s) and institution of treatment, including oxygen
therapy, indicated supportive measures and dantrolene (consult
dantrolene sodium intravenous package insert before using).</p>
<p>Injections containing epinephrine or other vasoconstrictors
should not be used for intravenous regional anesthesia.</p>
<p>Lidocaine should be used with caution in persons with known drug
sensitivities. Patients allergic to para-amino-benzoic acid derivatives
(procaine, tetracaine, benzocaine, etc.) have not shown cross
sensitivity to lidocaine.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Use in the Head and Neck
Area:</span></span> Small doses of local anesthetics injected into the head and
neck area, including retrobulbar, dental and stellate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="72712" conceptname="Synovial cyst">ganglion</span> blocks,
may produce adverse reactions similar to systemic toxicity seen with
unintentional intravascular injections of larger doses. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">Confusion</span>,
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317109" conceptname="Respiratory arrest">respiratory arrest</span> and
cardiovascular stimulation or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> have been reported. These
reactions may be due to intra-arterial injections of the local
anesthetic with retrograde flow to the cerebral circulation. Patients
receiving these blocks should have their circulation and respiration
monitored and be constantly observed. Resuscitative equipment and
personnel for treating adverse reactions should be immediately
available. Dosage recommendations should not be exceeded. (See <span><span class="Emphasis">DOSAGE AND
ADMINISTRATION</span></span>).</p>
<p><span><span class="Emphasis">Information for Patients:</span></span> When appropriate, patients should be informed in advance that
they may experience temporary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4141128" conceptname="Absence of sensation">loss of sensation</span> and motor activity,
usually in the lower half of the body following proper administration of
epidural anesthesia.</p>
<p><span><span class="Emphasis">Clinically Significant Drug
Interactions:</span></span> The administration of local anesthetic solutions containing
epinephrine or norepinephrine to patients receiving monoamine oxidase
inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants may produce severe prolonged
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>.</p>
<p>Phenothiazines and butyrophenones may reduce or reverse the
pressor effect of epinephrine.</p>
<p>Concurrent use of these agents should generally be avoided. In
situations when concurrent therapy is necessary, careful patient
monitoring is essential.</p>
<p>Concurrent administration of vasopressor drugs (for the treatment
of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> related to obstetric blocks) and ergot-type oxytocic
drugs may cause severe persistent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> or cerebrovascular
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440279" conceptname="Accident">accidents</span>.</p>
<p><span><span class="Emphasis">Drug Laboratory Test
Interactions:</span></span> The intramuscular injection of lidocaine may result in an
increase in creatine phosphokinase levels. Thus, the use of this enzyme
determination without isoenzyme separation as a diagnostic test for the
presence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">acute myocardial infarction</span> may be compromised by the
intramuscular injection of lidocaine.</p>
<p><span><span class="Emphasis">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis,
Impairment of Fertility:</span></span> Studies of lidocaine in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic
and mutagenic potential or the effect on fertility have not been
conducted.</p>
<p><span><span class="Emphasis">Pregnancy:</span></span> Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction
studies have been performed in rats at doses up to 6.6 times the human
dose and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus caused by
lidocaine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies
in pregnant women. Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive
of human response. General consideration should be given to this fact
before administering lidocaine to women of childbearing potential,
especially during early pregnancy when maximum organogenesis takes
place.</p>
<p><span><span class="Emphasis">Labor and Delivery:</span></span> Local anesthetics rapidly cross the placenta and when used
for epidural, paracervical, pudendal or caudal block anesthesia, can
cause varying degrees of maternal, fetal and neonatal toxicity (See
<span><span class="Emphasis">CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY</span></span><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">-Pharmacokinetics</span></span>). The potential for toxicity depends upon the procedure
performed, the type and amount of drug used, and the technique of drug
administration. Adverse reactions in the parturient, fetus and neonate
involve alterations of the central nervous system peripheral vascular
tone and cardiac function.</p>
<p>Maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> has resulted from regional anesthesia. Local
anesthetics produce vasodilation by blocking sympathetic nerves.
Elevating the patientâ€™s legs and positioning her on her left
side will help prevent decreases in blood pressure. The fetal heart rate
also should be monitored continuously, and electronic fetal monitoring
is highly advisable.</p>
<p>Epidural, spinal, paracervical, or pudendal anesthesia may alter
the forces of parturition through changes in uterine contractility or
maternal expulsive efforts. In one study, paracervical block anesthesia
was associated with a decrease in the mean duration of first stage labor
and facilitation of cervical dilation. However, spinal and epidural
anesthesia have also been reported to prolong the second stage of labor
by removing the parturientâ€™s reflex urge to bear down or by
interfering with motor function. The use of obstetrical anesthesia may
increase the need for forceps assistance.</p>
<p>The use of some local anesthetic drug products during labor and
delivery may be followed by diminished muscle strength and tone for the
first day or two of life. The long term significance of these
observations is unknown. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314749" conceptname="Fetal bradycardia">Fetal bradycardia</span> may occur in 20 to 30 percent
of patients receiving paracervical nerve block anesthesia with the
amide-type local anesthetics and may be associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4344632" conceptname="Fetal acidosis">fetal acidosis</span>.
Fetal heart rate should always be monitored during paracervical
anesthesia. The physician should weigh the possible advantages against
risks when considering paracervical block in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439128" conceptname="Extreme immaturity">prematurity</span>, toxemia of

<p><span><span class="Emphasis">Neurologic:</span></span> The incidences of adverse reactions associated with the use
of local anesthetics may be related to the total dose of local

to local anesthetic techniques, with or without a contribution from the
local anesthetic.</p>
<p>In the practice of caudal or lumbar epidural block, occasional
unintentional penetration of the subarachnoid space by the catheter may
occur. Subsequent adverse effects may depend partially on the amount of

magnitude (including total spinal block), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> secondary to
spinal block, loss of bladder and bowel control, and loss of perineal
sensation and sexual function. Persistent motor, sensory and/or
autonomic (sphincter control) deficit of some lower spinal segments with
slow recovery (several months) or incomplete recovery have been reported
in rare instances when caudal or lumbar epidural block has been
attempted. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134736" conceptname="Backache">Backache</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> have also been noted following use of

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Acute emergencies from local anesthetics are generally related to
high plasma levels encountered during therapeutic use of local
anesthetics or to unintended subarachnoid injection of local anesthetic
solution (see <span><span class="Emphasis">ADVERSE REACTIONS, </span></span><span><span class="Emphasis">WARNINGS</span></span> and <span><span class="Emphasis">PRECAUTIONS</span></span>).Â Â  </p>
<p><span><span class="Emphasis">Management of Local Anesthetic
Emergencies:</span></span> The first consideration is prevention, best accomplished by
careful monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory vital signs and the
patientâ€™s state of consciousness after each local anesthetic
injection. At the first sign of change, oxygen should be administered.</p>
<p>The first step in the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>, as well as
under-ventilation or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span> due to unintended subarachnoid injection of
drug solution, consists of immediate attention to the maintenance of a
patent airway and assisted or controlled ventilation with oxygen and a
delivery system capable of permitting immediate positive airway pressure
by mask. Immediately after the institution of these ventilatory
measures, the adequacy of the circulation should be evaluated, keeping
in mind that drugs used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> sometimes depress the
circulation when administered intravenously. Should <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> persist
despite adequate respiratory support, and if the status of the
circulation permits, small increments of an ultra-short acting
barbiturate (such as thiopental or thiamylal) or a benzodiazepine (such
as diazepam) may be administered intravenously.Â  The clinician
should be familiar, prior to use of local anesthetics, with these
anticonvulsant drugs. Supportive treatment of circulatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> may
require administration of intravenous fluids and, when appropriate, a
vasopressor as directed by the clinical situation (e.g., ephedrine).</p>
<p>If not treated immediately, both <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> and cardiovascular
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> can result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span> and
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span>. Underventilation or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span> due to unintentional
subarachnoid injection of local anesthetic solution may produce these
same signs and also lead to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span> if ventilatory support is not
instituted. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span> should occur standard cardiopulmonary
resuscitative measures should be instituted.</p>
<p>Endotracheal intubation, employing drugs and techniques familiar
to the clinician, may be indicated, after initial administration of
oxygen by mask, if difficulty is encountered in the maintenance of a
patent airway or if prolonged ventilatory support (assisted or
controlled) is indicated.</p>
<p>Dialysis is of negligible value in the treatment of acute
overdosage with lidocaine.</p>
<p>The oral LD<span class="Sub">50</span> of lidocaine HCl in non-fasted female
rats is 459 (346-773) mg/kg (as the salt) and 214 (159-324) mg/kg (as
the salt) in fasted female rats.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Table I (Recommended Dosages) summarizes the recommended volumes and concentrations of Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection, USP for various types of anesthetic procedures. The dosages suggested in this table are for normal healthy adults and refer to the use of epinephrine-free solutions. When larger volumes are required only solutions containing epinephrine should be used, except in those cases where vasopressor drugs may be contraindicated.</p>
<p>There have been adverse event reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4345581" conceptname="Chondrolysis of articular cartilage">chondrolysis</span> in patients receiving intra-articular infusions of local anesthetics following arthroscopic and other surgical procedures.Â  Lidocaine is not approved for this use (see <span><span class="Emphasis">WARNINGS</span></span> and <span><span class="Emphasis">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span></span>).</p>
<p>These recommended doses serve only as a guide to the amount of anesthetic required for most routine procedures. The actual volumes and concentrations to be used depend on a number of factors such as type and extent of surgical procedure, depth of anesthesia and degree of muscular relaxation required, duration of anesthesia required, and the physical condition of the patient. In all cases the lowest concentration and smallest dose that will produce the desired result should be given. Dosages should be reduced for children and for elderly and debilitated patients and patients with cardiac and/or liver disease.</p>
<p>The onset of anesthesia, the duration of anesthesia and the degree of muscular relaxation are proportional to the volume and concentration (i.e., total dose) of local anesthetic used. Thus, an increase in volume and concentration of Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection, USP will decrease the onset of anesthesia, prolong the duration of anesthesia, provide a greater degree of muscular relaxation and increase the segmental spread of anesthesia. However, increasing the volume and concentration of Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection, USP may result in a more profound <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314171" conceptname="Low blood pressure reading">fall in blood pressure</span> when used in epidural anesthesia. Although the incidence of side effects with lidocaine is quite low, caution should be exercised when employing large volumes and concentrations, since the incidence of side effects is directly proportional to the total dose of local anesthetic agent injected.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Epidural Anesthesia</span></span></p>
<p>For an epidural test dose, only the following <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">available</span></span> specific product of Lidocaine Hydrochloride and Epinephrine Injection, USP by Hospira is recommended:</p>
<p>1.5% with epinephrine 1:200,000.................... 5 mL single-dose ampuls</p>
<p>For epidural anesthesia, only the following <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">available</span></span> specific products of Lidocaine Hydrochloride and Epinephrine Injection, USP by Hospira are recommended:</p>
<p>Â 1% with epinephrine 1:200,000............................ 30 mL single-dose ampuls</p>

<p>1.5% with epinephrine 1:200,000.......................... 30 mL single-dose ampuls</p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â 30 mL single-dose vials</p>
<p>2% with epinephrine 1:200,000................................ 20 mL single-dose vials</p>
<p>Although these solutions are intended specifically for epidural anesthesia, they may also be used for infiltration and peripheral nerve block provided they are employed as single-dose units. These solutions contain no bacteriostatic agent.</p>
<p>In epidural anesthesia, the dosage varies with the number of dermatomes to be anesthetized (generally 2-3 mL of the indicated concentration per dermatome).</p>
<p><span><span class="Emphasis">Caudal and Lumbar Epidural Block:</span></span> As a precaution against the adverse experiences sometimes observed following unintentional penetration of the subarachnoid space, a test dose such as 2-3 mL of 1.5% lidocaine injection should be administered at least 5 minutes prior to injecting the total volume required for a lumbar or caudal epidural block. The test dose should be repeated if the patient is moved in a manner that may have displaced the catheter. Epinephrine, if contained in the test dose (10-15 Âµg have been suggested), may serve as a warning of unintentional intravascular injection. If injected into a blood vessel, this amount of epinephrine is likely to produce a transient â€œepinephrine responseâ€? within 45 seconds, consisting of an increase in heart rate and systolic blood pressure, circumoral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260836" conceptname="Blanching of skin">pallor</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315078" conceptname="Palpitations">palpitations</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436817" conceptname="Feeling nervous">nervousness</span> in the unsedated patient. The sedated patient may exhibit only a pulse rate increase of 20 or more beats per minute for 15 or more seconds. Patients on beta-blockers may not manifest changes in heart rate, but blood pressure monitoring can detect an evanescent rise in systolic blood pressure. Adequate time should be allowed for onset of anesthesia after administration of each test dose. The rapid injection of a large volume of Lidocaine Hydrochloride and Epinephrine Injection, USP through the catheter should be avoided, and, when feasible, fractional doses should be administered.</p>
<p>In the event of the known injection of a large volume of local anesthetic solution into the subarachnoid space, after suitable resuscitation and if the catheter is in place, consider attempting the recovery of drug by draining a moderate amount of cerebrospinal fluid (such as 10 mL) through the epidural catheter.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Maximum Recommended Dosages</span></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Adults:</span></span> For normal healthy adults, the individual maximum dose of Lidocaine Hydrochloride and Epinephrine Injection, USP should not exceed 7 mg/kg (3.5 mg/lb) of body weight and in general it is recommended that the maximum total dose not exceed 500 mg. When used without epinephrine, the maximum individual dose should not exceed 4.5 mg/kg (2 mg per lb) of body weight, and in general it is recommended that the maximum total dose does not exceed 300 mg. For continuous epidural or caudal anesthesia, the maximum recommended dosage should not be administered at intervals of less than 90 minutes. When continuous lumbar or caudal epidural anesthesia is used for non-obstetrical procedures, more drug may be administered if required to produce adequate anesthesia.</p>
<p>The maximum recommended dose per 90 minute period of lidocaine hydrochloride for paracervical block in obstetrical patients and non-obstetrical patients is 200 mg total. One half of the total dose is usually administered to each side. Inject slowly five minutes between sides. (See also discussion of paracervical block in <span><span class="Emphasis">PRECAUTIONS</span></span>).</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Pediatric Population:</span></span> It is difficult to recommend a maximum dose of any drug for pediatric patients, since this varies as a function of age and weight. For pediatric patients over 3 years of age who have a normal lean body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> and normal body development, the maximum dose is determined by the childâ€™s age and weight. For example, in a child of 5 years weighing 50 lbs., the dose of lidocaine HCl should not exceed 75-100 mg (1.5-2 mg/lb).</p>
<p>In order to guard against systemic toxicity, the lowest effective concentration and lowest effective dose should be used at all times. In some cases it will be necessary to dilute available concentrations with 0.9% sodium chloride injection in order to obtain the required final concentration.</p>
<p>FOR EPIDURAL USE ONLY.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Note:</span></span> Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever the solution and container permit. Do not use the injection if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate.</p>

<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Sterilization, Storage and Technical Procedures:</span></span> Disinfecting agents containing heavy metals, which cause release of respective ions (mercury, zinc, copper, etc.) should not be used for skin or mucous membrane disinfection as they have been related to incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span>. When chemical disinfection of multi-dose vials is desired, either isopropyl alcohol (91%) or 70% ethyl alcohol is recommended. Many commercially available brands of rubbing alcohol, as well as solutions of ethyl alcohol not of USP grade, contain denaturants which are injurious to rubber and, therefore, are not to be used. It is recommended that chemical disinfection be accomplished by wiping the vial stopper or ampul thoroughly with cotton or gauze that has been moistened with the recommended alcohol just prior to use.</p>
