<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Midazolam Injection, USP is a water-soluble benzodiazepine available as a sterile, non pyrogenic parenteral dosage form for intravenous or intramuscular injection.  Each mL contains midazolam hydrochloride equivalent to 1 mg or 5 mg midazolam compounded with 0.8% sodium chloride and 0.01% disodium edetate, with 1% benzyl alcohol as preservative; the pH is adjusted to 3 to 3.6 with hydrochloric acid and, if necessary, sodium hydroxide. </p>
<p>Midazolam is a white to light yellow crystalline compound, insoluble in water.  The hydrochloride salt of midazolam, which is formed<span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis"> in situ, </span></span>is soluble in aqueous solutions.  Chemically, midazolam HCl is 8-chloro-6-(2-fluorophenyl)- 1-methyl-4H-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine hydrochloride.  Midazolam hydrochloride has the following structural formula:</p>

<p>Under the acidic conditions required to solubilize midazolam in the product, midazolam is present as an equilibrium mixture (shown below) of the closed ring form shown above and an open-ring structure formed by the acid-catalyzed ring opening of the 4,5-double bond of the diazepine ring.  The amount of open-ring form is dependent upon the pH of the solution.  At the specified pH of the product, the solution may contain up to about 25% of the open-ring compound.  At the physiologic conditions under which the product is absorbed (pH of 5 to 8) into the systemic circulation, any open-ring form present reverts to the physiologically active, lipophilic, closed-ring form (midazolam) and is absorbed as such.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine central nervous system (CNS) depressant.  </p>
<p>The effects of midazolam on the CNS are dependent on the dose administered, the route of administration, and the presence or absence of other medications. Onset time of sedative effects after IM administration in adults is 15 minutes, with peak sedation occurring 30 to 60 minutes following injection.  In one adult study, when tested the following day, 73% of the patients who received midazolam intramuscularly had no recall of memory cards shown 30 minutes following drug administration; 40% had no recall of the memory cards shown 60 minutes following drug administration.  Onset time of sedative effects in the pediatric population begins within 5 minutes and peaks at 15 to 30 minutes depending upon the dose administered.  In pediatric patients, up to 85% had no recall of pictures shown after receiving intramuscular midazolam compared with 5% of the placebo controls. </p>
<p>Sedation in adult and pediatric patients is achieved within 3 to 5 minutes after intravenous (IV) injection; the time of onset is affected by total dose administered and the concurrent administration of narcotic premedication.  Seventy-one percent of the adult patients in endoscopy studies had no recall of introduction of the endoscope; 82% of the patients had no recall of withdrawal of the endoscope.  In one study of pediatric patients undergoing lumbar puncture or bone marrow <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span>, 88% of patients had impaired recall vs. 9% of the placebo controls.  In another pediatric oncology study, 91% of midazolam treated patients were amnestic compared with 35% of patients who had received fentanyl alone. </p>
<p>When midazolam is given IV as an anesthetic induction agent, induction of anesthesia occurs in approximately 1.5 minutes when narcotic premedication has been administered and in 2 to 2.5 minutes without narcotic premedication or other sedative premedication.  Some impairment in a test of memory was noted in 90% of the patients studied.  A dose response study of pediatric patients premedicated with 1 mg/kg intramuscular (IM) meperidine found that only 4 out of 6 pediatric patients who received 600 mcg/kg IV midazolam <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372448" conceptname="Loss of consciousness">lost consciousness</span>, with eye closing at 108 ± 140 seconds.  This group was compared with pediatric patients who were given thiopental 5 mg/kg IV; 6 out of 6 closed their eyes at 20 ± 3.2 seconds.  Midazolam did not dependably induce anesthesia at this dose despite concomitant opioid administration in pediatric patients.</p>
<p>Midazolam, used as directed, does not delay awakening from general anesthesia in adults.  Gross tests of recovery after awakening (orientation, ability to stand and walk, suitability for discharge from the recovery room, return to baseline Trieger competency) usually indicate recovery within 2 hours but recovery may take up to 6 hours in some cases.  When compared with patients who received thiopental, patients who received midazolam generally recovered at a slightly slower rate.  Recovery from anesthesia or sedation for procedures in pediatric patients depends on the dose of midazolam administered, coadministration of other medications causing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span> and duration of the procedure. </p>
<p>In patients without intracranial lesions, induction of general anesthesia with IV midazolam is associated with a moderate decrease in cerebrospinal fluid pressure (lumbar puncture measurements), similar to that observed following IV thiopental.  Preliminary data in neurosurgical patients with normal intracranial pressure but decreased compliance (subarachnoid screw measurements) show comparable elevations of intracranial pressure with midazolam and with thiopental during intubation.  No similar studies have been reported in pediatric patients.</p>
<p>The usual recommended intramuscular premedicating doses of midazolam do not depress the ventilatory response to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135927" conceptname="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</span> stimulation to a clinically significant extent in adults.  Intravenous induction doses of midazolam depress the ventilatory response to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135927" conceptname="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</span> stimulation for 15 minutes or more beyond the duration of ventilatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> following administration of thiopental in adults.  Impairment of ventilatory response to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135927" conceptname="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</span> is more marked in adult patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255573" conceptname="Chronic obstructive lung disease">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255573" conceptname="Chronic obstructive lung disease">COPD</span>).  Sedation with IV midazolam does not adversely affect the mechanics of respiration (resistance, static recoil, most lung volume measurements); total lung capacity and peak expiratory flow decrease significantly but static compliance and maximum expiratory flow at 50% of awake total lung capacity (Vmax) increase.  In one study of pediatric patients under general anesthesia, intramuscular midazolam (100 or 200 mcg/kg) was shown to depress the response to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135927" conceptname="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</span> in a dose-related manner. </p>
<p>In cardiac hemodynamic studies in adults, IV induction of general anesthesia with midazolam was associated with a slight to moderate decrease in mean arterial pressure, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4231869" conceptname="Stroke volume">stroke volume</span> and systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span>.  Slow heart rates (less than 65/minute), particularly in patients taking propranolol for angina, tended to rise slightly; faster heart rates (eg, 85/minute) tended to slow slightly.  In pediatric patients, a comparison of IV midazolam (500 mcg/kg) with propofol (2.5 mg/kg) revealed a mean 15% decrease in systolic blood pressure in patients who had received IV midazolam vs a mean 25% decrease in systolic blood pressure following propofol.</p>

<h2>Pharamacokinetics<br>
</h2>
<p class="First">Midazolam’s activity is primarily due to the parent drug.  Elimination of the parent drug takes place via hepatic metabolism of midazolam to hydroxylated metabolites that are conjugated and excreted in the urine.  Six single-dose pharmacokinetic studies involving healthy adults yield pharmacokinetic parameters for midazolam in the following ranges: volume of distribution (Vd), 1 to 3.1 L/kg; elimination half-life, 1.8 to 6.4 hours (mean approximately 3 hours); total clearance (Cl), 0.25 to 0.54 L/hr/kg. In a parallel group study, there was no difference in the clearance, in subjects administered 0.15 mg/kg (n=4) and 0.3 mg/kg (n=4) IV doses indicating linear kinetics.  The clearance was successively reduced by approximately 30% at doses of 0.45 mg/kg (n=4) and 0.6 mg/kg (n=5) indicating non-linear kinetics in this dose range.</p>

<h2>Absorption<br>
</h2>
<p class="First">The absolute bioavailability of the intramuscular route was greater than 90% in a crossover study in which healthy subjects (n=17) were administered a 7.5 mg IV or IM dose.  The mean peak concentration (Cmax) and time to peak (Tmax) following the IM dose was 90 ng/mL (20% CV) and 0.5 hour (50% CV).  Cmax for the 1-hydroxy metabolite following the IM dose was 8 ng/mL (Tmax=1 hour). </p>
<p>Following IM administration, Cmax for midazolam and its 1-hydroxy metabolite were approximately one-half of those achieved after intravenous injection.</p>

<h2>Distribution<br>
</h2>
<p class="First">The volume of distribution (Vd) determined from six single-dose pharmacokinetic studies involving healthy adults ranged from 1 to 3.1 L/kg.  Female gender, old age, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433736" conceptname="Obesity">obesity</span> are associated with increased values of midazolam Vd.  In humans, midazolam has been shown to cross the placenta and enter into fetal circulation and has been detected in human milk and CSF (see <span class="Bold Italics"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#da8319a7-367a-4340-92ff-9ce79ab19acc">Special Populations</a></span></span>). </p>
<p>In adults and pediatric patients older than 1 year, midazolam is approximately 97% bound to plasma protein, principally albumin.</p>

<h2>Metabolism<br>
</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">In vitro </span></span>studies with human liver microsomes indicate that the biotrans formation of midazolam is mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4.  This cytochrome also appears to be present in gastrointestinal tract mucosa as well as liver.  Sixty to seventy percent of the biotransformation products is 1-hydroxy-midazolam (also termed alpha-hydroxy-midazolam) while 4-hydroxy-midazolam constitutes 5% or less.  Small amounts of a dihydroxy derivative have also been detected but not quantified.  The principal urinary excretion products are glucuronide conjugates of the hydroxylated derivatives. </p>
<p>Drugs that inhibit the activity of cytochrome P450 3A4 may inhibit midazolam clearance and elevate steady-state midazolam concentrations. </p>
<p>Studies of the intravenous administration of 1-hydroxy-midazolam in humans suggest that 1-hydroxy-midazolam is at least as potent as the parent compound and may contribute to the net pharmacologic activity of midazolam.  <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">In vitro </span></span>studies have demonstrated that the affinities of 1- and 4-hydroxy-midazolam for the benzodiazepine receptor are approximately 20% and 7%, respectively, relative to midazolam.</p>

<h2>Excretion<br>
</h2>
<p class="First">Clearance of midazolam is reduced in association with old age, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>, liver disease (cirrhosis) or conditions which diminish <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span> and hepatic blood flow. </p>
<p>The principal urinary excretion product is 1-hydroxy-midazolam in the form of a glucuronide conjugate; smaller amounts of the glucuronide conjugates of 4-hydroxy- and dihydroxy-midazolam are detected as well.  The amount of midazolam excreted unchanged in the urine after a single IV dose is less than 0.5% (n=5).  Following a single IV infusion in 5 healthy volunteers, 45% to 57% of the dose was excreted in the urine as 1-hydroxymethyl midazolam conjugate.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics- Continuous Infusion<br>
</h2>
<p class="First">The pharmacokinetic profile of midazolam following continuous infusion, based on 282 adult subjects, has been shown to be similar to that following single-dose administration for subjects of comparable age, gender, body habitus and health status.  However, midazolam can accumulate in peripheral tissues with continuous infusion.  The effects of accumulation are greater after long-term infusions than after short-term infusions.  The effects of accumulation can be reduced by maintaining the lowest midazolam infusion rate that produces satisfactory sedation. </p>
<p>Infrequent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotensive episodes</span> have occurred during continuous infusion; however, neither the time to onset nor the duration of the episode appeared to be related to plasma concentrations of midazolam or alpha-hydroxy-midazolam.  Further, there does not appear to be an increased chance of occurrence of a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotensive episode</span> with increased loading doses. </p>
<p>Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> may have longer elimination half-lives for midazolam (see <span class="Bold Italics"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#da8319a7-367a-4340-92ff-9ce79ab19acc">Special Populations</a>: </span></span><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Failure</span></span></span>).</p>

<h2>Special Populations<br>
</h2>
<p class="First">Changes in the pharmacokinetic profile of midazolam due to drug interactions, physiological variables, etc., may result in changes in the plasma concentration-time profile and pharmacological response to midazolam in these patients.  For example, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span> appear to have a longer elimination half-life for midazolam and may experience delayed recovery (see <span class="Bold Italics"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Bold Italics"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#da8319a7-367a-4340-92ff-9ce79ab19acc">Special Populations</a>: </span></span></span></span><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Failure</span></span></span></span></span>).  In other groups, the relationship between prolonged half-life and duration of effect has not been established. </p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Pediatrics and Neonates:  </span></span>In pediatric patients aged 1 year and older, the pharmacokinetic properties following a single dose of midazolam reported in 10 separate studies of midazolam are similar to those in adults.  Weight-normalized clearance is similar or higher (0.19 to 0.8 L/hr/kg) than in adults and the terminal elimination half-life (0.78 to 3.3 hours) is similar to or shorter than in adults.  The pharmacokinetic properties during and following continuous intravenous infusion in pediatric patients in the operating room as an adjunct to general anesthesia and in the intensive care environment are similar to those in adults. </p>
<p>In seriously ill neonates, however, the terminal elimination half-life of midazolam is substantially prolonged (6.5 to 12 hours) and the clearance reduced (0.07 to 0.12 L/hr/kg) compared to healthy adults or other groups of pediatric patients.  It cannot be determined if these differences are due to age, immature organ function or metabolic pathways, underlying illness or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">debility</span>. </p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Obese:  </span></span>In a study comparing normals (n=20) and obese patients (n=20) the mean half-life was greater in the obese group (5.9 vs 2.3 hours).  This was due to an increase of approximately 50% in the Vd corrected for total body weight.  The clearance was not significantly different between groups. </p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Geriatric:  </span></span>In three parallel group studies, the pharmacokinetics of midazolam administered IV or IM were compared in young (mean age 29, n=52) and healthy elderly subjects (mean age 73, n=53).  Plasma half-life was approximately two-fold higher in the elderly.  The mean Vd based on total body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight increased</span> consistently between 15% to 100% in the elderly.  The mean Cl decreased approximately 25% in the elderly in two studies and was similar to that of the younger patients in the other. </p>

<p>Midazolam and 1-hydroxy-midazolam pharmacokinetics in 6 ICU patients who developed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span> (ARF) were compared with a normal renal function control group. Midazolam was administered as an infusion (5 to 15 mg/hr).  Midazolam clearance was reduced (1.9 vs 2.8 mL/min/kg) and the half-life was prolonged (7.6 vs 13 hours) in the ARF patients.  The renal clearance of the 1-hydroxy-midazolam glucuronide was prolonged in the ARF group (4 vs 136 mL/ min) and the half-life was prolonged (12 vs &gt; 25 hours).

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Midazolam Injection, USP is indicated: </p>
<ul>
<li>intramuscularly or intravenously for preoperative sedation/anxiolysis/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439147" conceptname="Amnesia">amnesia</span>; </li>
<li>intravenously as an agent for sedation/anxiolysis/ <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439147" conceptname="Amnesia">amnesia</span> prior to or during diagnostic, therapeutic or endoscopic procedures, such as bronchoscopy, gastroscopy, cystoscopy, coronary angiography, cardiac catheterization, oncology procedures, radiologic procedures, suture of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443419" conceptname="Laceration - injury">lacerations</span> and other procedures either alone or in combination with other CNS depressants; </li>
<li>intravenously for induction of general anesthesia, before administration of other anesthetic agents.  With the use of narcotic premedication, induction of anesthesia can be attained within a relatively narrow dose range and in a short period of time.  Intravenous midazolam can also be used as a component of intravenous supplementation of nitrous oxide and oxygen (balanced anesthesia); </li>
<li>continuous intravenous infusion for sedation of intubated and mechanically ventilated patients as a component of anesthesia or during treatment in a critical care setting. </li>
</ul>
<p>Midazolam is associated with a high incidence of partial or complete impairment of recall for the next several hours (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#f6a4826c-de74-4251-a867-e62d072e80b9">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span></span>).</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Midazolam must never be used without individualization of dosage particularly when used with other medications capable of producing central nervous system <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.  Prior to the intravenous administration of midazolam in any dose, the immediate availability of oxygen, resuscitative drugs, age- and size-appropriate equipment for bag/valve/mask ventilation and intubation, and skilled personnel for the maintenance of a patent airway and support of ventilation should be ensured. Patients should be continuously monitored with some means of detection for early signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312603" conceptname="Hypoventilation">hypoventilation</span>, airway obstruction, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span>, ie, pulse oximetry. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312603" conceptname="Hypoventilation">Hypoventilation</span>, airway obstruction, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span> can lead to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxia</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span> unless effective countermeasures are taken immediately.  </span></span>The immediate availability of specific reversal agents (flumazenil) is highly recommended.  Vital signs should continue to be monitored during the recovery period.  Because intravenous midazolam depresses respiration (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#f6a4826c-de74-4251-a867-e62d072e80b9">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span></span>) and because opioid agonists and other sedatives can add to this <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, midazolam should be administered as an induction agent only by a person trained in general anesthesia and should be used for sedation/anxiolysis/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439147" conceptname="Amnesia">amnesia</span> only in the presence of personnel skilled in early detection of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312603" conceptname="Hypoventilation">hypoventilation</span>, maintaining a patent airway and supporting ventilation.  <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">When used for sedation/anxiolysis/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439147" conceptname="Amnesia">amnesia</span>, midazolam should always be titrated slowly in adult or pediatric patients.  </span></span>Adverse hemodynamic events have been reported in pediatric patients with cardiovascular instability; rapid intravenous administration should also be avoided in this population (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#d684b678-cbae-4e0d-a572-40b8fb2a50dd">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a> </span></span>for complete information). </p>
<p>Serious cardiorespiratory adverse events have occurred after administration of midazolam.  These have included <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, airway obstruction, oxygen desaturation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317109" conceptname="Respiratory arrest">respiratory arrest</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span>, sometimes resulting in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> or permanent neurologic injury.  There have also been rare reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotensive episodes</span> requiring treatment during or after diagnostic or surgical manipulations particularly in adult or pediatric patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4311860" conceptname="Hemodynamic instability">hemodynamic instability</span>.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> occurred more frequently in the sedation studies in patients premedicated with a narcotic.  </p>
<p>Reactions such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, involuntary movements (including tonic/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4270553" conceptname="Clonus">clonic movements</span> and muscle <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span>), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">hyperactivity</span> and combativeness have been reported in both adult and pediatric patients.  These reactions may be due to inadequate or excessive dosing or improper administration of midazolam; however, consideration should be given to the possibility of cerebral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxia</span> or true paradoxical reactions.  Should such reactions occur, the response to each dose of midazolam and all other drugs, including local anesthetics, should be evaluated before proceeding.  Reversal of such responses with flumazenil has been reported in pediatric patients. </p>
<p>Concomitant use of barbiturates, alcohol or other central nervous system depressants may increase the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312603" conceptname="Hypoventilation">hypoventilation</span>, airway obstruction, desaturation, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span> and may contribute to profound and/or prolonged drug effect.  Narcotic premedication also depresses the ventilatory response to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135927" conceptname="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</span> stimulation. </p>
<p>Higher risk adult and pediatric surgical patients, elderly patients and debilitated adult and pediatric patients require lower dosages, whether or not concomitant sedating medications have been administered.  Adult or pediatric patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255573" conceptname="Chronic obstructive lung disease">COPD</span> are unusually sensitive to the respiratory depressant effect of midazolam.  Pediatric and adult patients undergoing procedures involving the upper airway such as upper endoscopy or dental care, are particularly vulnerable to episodes of desaturation and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312603" conceptname="Hypoventilation">hypoventilation</span> due to partial airway obstruction.  Adult and pediatric patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198185" conceptname="Chronic renal failure">chronic renal failure</span> and patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span> eliminate midazolam more slowly (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#f6a4826c-de74-4251-a867-e62d072e80b9">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span></span>).  Because elderly patients frequently have inefficient function of one or more organ systems and because dosage requirements have been shown to decrease with age, reduced initial dosage of midazolam is recommended, and the possibility of profound and/or prolonged effect should be considered. </p>
<p>Injectable midazolam should not be administered to adult or pediatric patients in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>, or in acute alcohol <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> of vital signs.  Particular care should be exercised in the use of intravenous midazolam in adult or pediatric patients with uncompensated acute illnesses, such as severe fluid or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022093" conceptname="Electrolyte imbalance">electrolyte disturbances</span>. </p>
<p>There have been limited reports of intra-arterial injection of midazolam.  Adverse events have included local reactions, as well as isolated reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> activity in which no clear causal relationship was established.  Precautions against unintended intra-arterial injection should be taken.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4295895" conceptname="Extravasation">Extravasation</span> should also be avoided. </p>
<p>The safety and efficacy of midazolam following nonintravenous and nonintramuscular routes of administration have not been established.  Midazolam should only be administered intramuscularly or intravenously. </p>
<p>The decision as to when patients who have received injectable midazolam, particularly on an outpatient basis, may again engage in activities requiring complete mental alertness, operate hazardous machinery or drive a motor vehicle must be individualized.  Gross tests of recovery from the effects of midazolam (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#f6a4826c-de74-4251-a867-e62d072e80b9">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span></span>) cannot be relied upon to predict reaction time under stress.  It is recommended that no patient operate hazardous machinery or a motor vehicle until the effects of the drug, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, have subsided or until one full day after anesthesia and surgery, whichever is longer.  For pediatric patients, particular care should be taken to assure safe ambulation.</p>

<h2>Usage in Preterm Infants and Neonates<br>
</h2>
<p class="First">Rapid injection should be avoided in the neonatal population.  Midazolam administered rapidly as an intravenous injection (less than 2 minutes) has been associated with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> in neonates, particularly when the patient has also received fentanyl.  Likewise, severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> has been observed in neonates receiving a continuous infusion of midazolam who then receive a rapid intravenous injection of fentanyl.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">Seizures</span> have been reported in several neonates following rapid intravenous administration. </p>
<p>The neonate also has reduced and/or immature organ function and is also vulnerable to profound and/or pro-longed respiratory effects of midazolam. </p>
<p>Exposure to excessive amounts of benzyl alcohol has been associated with toxicity (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span>), particularly in neonates, and an increased incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4326231" conceptname="Kernicterus">kernicterus</span>, particularly in small preterm infants.  There have been rare reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span>, primarily in preterm infants, associated with exposure to excessive amounts of benzyl alcohol.  The amount of benzyl alcohol from medications is usually considered negligible compared to that received in flush solutions containing benzyl alcohol.  Administration of high dosages of medications (including midazolam) containing this preservative must take into account the total amount of benzyl alcohol administered.  The recommended dosage range of midazolam for preterm and term infants includes amounts of benzyl alcohol well below that associated with toxicity; however, the amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known.  If the patient requires more than the recommended dosages or other medications containing this preservative, the practitioner must consider the daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from these combined sources.</p>

<h2>General<br>
</h2>
<p class="First">Intravenous doses of midazolam should be decreased for elderly and for debilitated patients (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#fc6413bd-017e-44c4-9b54-aba532dc2ebc">WARNINGS</a> </span></span>and <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#d684b678-cbae-4e0d-a572-40b8fb2a50dd">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span></span>).  These patients will also probably take longer to recover completely after midazolam administration for the induction of anesthesia. </p>

<h2>Use with Other CNS Depressants<br>
</h2>
<p class="First">The efficacy and safety of midazolam in clinical use are functions of the dose administered, the clinical status of the individual patient, and the use of concomitant medications capable of depressing the CNS.  Anticipated effects range from mild sedation to deep levels of sedation virtually equivalent to a state of general anesthesia where the patient may require external support of vital functions.  Care must be taken to individualize and carefully titrate the dose of midazolam to the patient’s underlying medical/surgical conditions, administer to the desired effect being certain to wait an adequate time for peak CNS effects of both midazolam and concomitant medications, and have the personnel and size-appropriate equipment and facilities available for monitoring and intervention (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#fe0b37b3-1733-408c-8f7e-807f710e244e">BOXED WARNING</a>, <a href="#fc6413bd-017e-44c4-9b54-aba532dc2ebc">WARNINGS</a> </span></span>and <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#d684b678-cbae-4e0d-a572-40b8fb2a50dd">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a> </span></span>sections).  Practitioners administering midazolam must have the skills necessary to manage reasonably foreseeable adverse effects, particularly skills in airway management.  For information regarding withdrawal see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#f8c8617e-1083-4f48-a37b-09125cad4b68">DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></a> </span></span>section.</p>

<h2>Information for Patients<br>
</h2>
<p class="First">To assure safe and effective use of benzodiazepines, the following information and instructions should be communicated to the patient when appropriate:
</p>
<p>1. Inform your physician about any alcohol consumption and medicine you are now taking, especially blood pressure medication and antibiotics, including drugs you buy without a prescription.  Alcohol has an increased effect when consumed with benzodiazepines; therefore, caution should be exercised regarding simultaneous ingestion of alcohol during benzodiazepine treatment. </p>
<p>2. Inform your physician if you are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant. </p>
<p>3. Inform your physician if you are nursing. </p>
<p>4. Patients should be informed of the pharmacological effects of midazolam, such as sedation and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439147" conceptname="Amnesia">amnesia</span>, which in some patients may be profound.  The decision as to when patients who have received injectable midazolam, particularly on an outpatient basis, may again engage in activities requiring complete mental alertness, operate hazardous machinery or drive a motor vehicle must be individualized. </p>
<p>5. Patients receiving continuous infusion of midazolam in critical care settings over an extended period of time, may experience symptoms of withdrawal following abrupt discontinuation.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions<br>
</h2>
<p class="First">The sedative effect of intravenous midazolam is accentuated by any concomitantly administered medication, which depresses the central nervous system, particularly narcotics (eg, morphine, meperidine and fentanyl) and also secobarbital and droperidol.  Consequently, the dosage of midazolam should be adjusted according to the type and amount of concomitant medications administered and the desired clinical response (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#d684b678-cbae-4e0d-a572-40b8fb2a50dd">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span></span>). </p>
<p>Caution is advised when midazolam is administered concomitantly with drugs that are known to inhibit the P450 3A4 enzyme system such as cimetidine (not ranitidine), erythromycin, diltiazem, verapamil, ketoconazole and itraconazole.  These drug interactions may result in prolonged sedation due to a decrease in plasma clearance of midazolam. </p>
<p>The effect of single oral doses of 800 mg cimetidine and 300 mg ranitidine on steady-state concentrations of midazolam was examined in a randomized crossover study (n=8).  Cimetidine increased the mean midazolam steady-state concentration from 57 to 71 ng/mL.  Ranitidine increased the mean steady-state concentration to 62 ng/mL.  No change in choice reaction time or sedation index was detected after dosing with the H2 receptor antagonists. </p>
<p>In a placebo-controlled study, erythromycin administered as a 500 mg dose, tid, for 1 week (n=6), reduced the clearance of midazolam following a single 0.5 mg/kg IV dose.  The half-life was approximately doubled. </p>
<p>The effects of diltiazem (60 mg tid) and verapamil (80 mg tid) on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of midazolam were investigated in a three-way crossover study (n=9).  The half-life of midazolam increased from 5 to 7 hours when midazolam was taken in conjunction with verapamil or diltiazem.  No interaction was observed in healthy subjects between midazolam and nifedipine. </p>
<p>A moderate reduction in induction dosage requirements of thiopental (about 15%) has been noted following use of intramuscular midazolam for premedication in adults. </p>
<p>The intravenous administration of midazolam decreases the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of halothane required for general anesthesia.  This decrease correlates with the dose of midazolam administered; no similar studies have been carried out in pediatric patients but there is no scientific reason to expect that pediatric patients would respond differently than adults.</p>
<p>Although the possibility of minor interactive effects has not been fully studied, midazolam and pancuronium have been used together in patients without noting clinically significant changes in dosage, onset or duration in adults.  Midazolam does not protect against the characteristic circulatory changes noted after administration of succinylcholine or pancuronium and does not protect against the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154803" conceptname="Raised intracranial pressure">increased intracranial pressure</span> noted following administration of succinylcholine.  Midazolam does not cause a clinically significant change in dosage, onset or duration of a single intubating dose of succinylcholine; no similar studies have been carried out in pediatric patients but there is no scientific reason to expect that pediatric patients would respond differently than adults. </p>
<p>No significant adverse interactions with commonly used premedications or drugs used during anesthesia and surgery (including atropine, scopolamine, glycopyrrolate, diazepam, hydroxyzine, d-tubocurarine, succinylcholine, and other nondepolarizing muscle relaxants) or topical local anesthetics (including lidocaine, dyclonine HCl and Cetacaine) have been observed in adults or pediatric patients.  In neonates, however, severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> has been reported with concomitant administration of fentanyl.  This effect has been observed in neonates on an infusion of midazolam who received a rapid injection of fentanyl and in patients on an infusion of fentanyl who have received a rapid injection of midazolam. </p>
<p>Caution is advised when midazolam is administered to patients receiving erythromycin since this may result in a decrease in the plasma clearance of midazolam.</p>

<h2>Treatment of Overdosage<br>
</h2>
<p class="First">Treatment of injectable midazolam overdosage is the same as that followed for overdosage with other benzodiazepines.  Respiration, pulse rate and blood pressure should be monitored and general supportive measures should be employed.  Attention should be given to the maintenance of a patent airway and support of ventilation, including administration of oxygen.  An intravenous infusion should be started.  Should <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> develop, treatment may include intravenous fluid therapy, repositioning, judicious use of vasopressors appropriate to the clinical situation, if indicated, and other appropriate countermeasures.  There is no information as to whether peritoneal dialysis, forced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span> or hemodialysis are of any value in the treatment of midazolam overdosage. </p>
<p>Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist, is indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines and may be used in situations when an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> with a benzodiazepine is known or suspected.  There are anecdotal reports of reversal of adverse hemodynamic responses associated with midazolam following administration of flumazenil to pediatric patients.  Prior to the administration of flumazenil, necessary measures should be instituted to secure the airway, assure adequate ventilation, and establish adequate intravenous access.  Flumazenil is intended as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, proper management of benzodiazepine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>.  Patients treated with flumazenil should be monitored for resedation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> and other residual benzodiazepine effects for an appropriate period after treatment.  <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Flumazenil will only reverse benzodiazepine-induced effects but will not reverse the effects of other concomitant medications</span></span>.  The reversal of benzodiazepine effects may be associated with the onset of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> in certain high-risk patients.  <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">The prescriber should be aware of a risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> in association with flumazenil treatment, particularly in long-term benzodiazepine users and in cyclic antidepressant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span></span></span>.  The complete flumazenil package insert, including <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#c65ccb54-efbf-46df-acce-1f8681a59d57">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>, <a href="#fc6413bd-017e-44c4-9b54-aba532dc2ebc">WARNINGS</a></span></span>, and <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#af570591-93d2-451f-92af-364ee9a0242a">PRECAUTIONS</a></span></span>, should be consulted prior to use.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Midazolam injection is a potent sedative agent that requires slow administration and individualization of dosage.  Clinical experience has shown midazolam to be 3 to 4 times as potent per mg as diazepam.  BECAUSE SERIOUS AND LIFE-THREATENING CARDIORESPIRATORY ADVERSE EVENTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED, PROVISION FOR MONITORING, DETECTION AND CORRECTION OF THESE REACTIONS MUST BE MADE FOR EVERY PATIENT TO WHOM MIDAZOLAM INJECTION IS ADMINISTERED, REGARDLESS OF AGE OR HEALTH STATUS.  Excessive single doses or rapid intravenous administration may result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, airway obstruction and/or arrest.  The potential for these latter effects is increased in debilitated patients, those receiving concomitant medications capable of depressing the CNS, and patients without an endotracheal tube but undergoing a procedure involving the upper airway such as endoscopy or dental (see <a href="#fe0b37b3-1733-408c-8f7e-807f710e244e">BOXED WARNING</a> and <a href="#fc6413bd-017e-44c4-9b54-aba532dc2ebc">WARNINGS</a>). </span></span></p>
<p>Reactions such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, involuntary movements, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">hyperactivity</span> and combativeness have been reported in adult and pediatric patients.  Should such reactions occur, caution should be exercised before continuing administration of midazolam (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#fc6413bd-017e-44c4-9b54-aba532dc2ebc">WARNINGS</a></span></span>). </p>
<p>Midazolam injection should only be administered IM or IV (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#fc6413bd-017e-44c4-9b54-aba532dc2ebc">WARNINGS</a></span></span>). </p>
<p>Care should be taken to avoid intra-arterial injection or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4295895" conceptname="Extravasation">extravasation</span> (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#fc6413bd-017e-44c4-9b54-aba532dc2ebc">WARNINGS</a></span></span>). </p>
<p>Midazolam injection may be mixed in the same syringe with the following frequently used premedications: morphine sulfate, meperidine, atropine sulfate or scopolamine. Midazolam, at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL, is compatible with 5% dextrose in water and 0.9% sodium chloride for up to 24 hours and with lactated Ringer’s solution for up to 4 hours.  Both the 1 mg/mL and 5 mg/mL formulations of midazolam may be diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% dextrose in water.</p>

<h2>Monitoring</h2>
<p class="First">Patient response to sedative agents, and resultant respiratory status, is variable.  Regardless of the intended level of sedation or route of administration, sedation is a continuum; a patient may move easily from light to deep sedation, with potential loss of protective reflexes.  This is especially true in pediatric patients.  Sedative doses should be individually titrated, taking into account patient age, clinical status and concomitant use of other CNS depressants.  Continuous monitoring of respiratory and cardiac function is required (ie, pulse oximetry). </p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Adults and Pediatrics:  </span></span>Sedation guidelines recommend a careful presedation history to determine how a patient’s underlying medical conditions or concomitant medications might affect their response to sedation/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> as well as physical examination including a focused examination of the airway for abnormalities.  Further recommendations include appropriate presedation fasting. </p>
<p>Titration to effect with multiple small doses is essential for safe administration.  It should be noted that adequate time to achieve peak central nervous system effect (3 to 5 minutes) for midazolam should be allowed between doses to minimize the potential for oversedation.  Sufficient time must elapse between doses of concomitant sedative medications to allow the effect of each dose to be assessed before subsequent drug administration.  This is an important consideration for all patients who receive intravenous midazolam. </p>
<p>Immediate availability of resuscitative drugs and <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">age- and size-appropriate </span></span>equipment and personnel trained in their use and skilled in airway management should be assured (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#fc6413bd-017e-44c4-9b54-aba532dc2ebc">WARNINGS</a></span></span>). </p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Pediatrics:  </span></span>For deeply sedated pediatric patients a dedicated individual, other than the practitioner performing the procedure, should monitor the patient throughout the procedure. </p>
<p>Intravenous access is not thought to be necessary for all pediatric patients sedated for a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure because in some cases the difficulty of gaining IV access would defeat the purpose of sedating the child; rather, emphasis should be placed upon having the intravenous equipment available and a practitioner skilled in establishing vascular access in pediatric patients immediately available.</p>

<p class="First">It should be recognized that the depth of sedation/anxiolysis needed for pediatric patients depends on the type of procedure to be performed.  For example, simple light sedation/anxiolysis in the preoperative period is quite different from the deep sedation and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> required for an endoscopic procedure in a child.  For this reason, there is a broad range of dosage.  For all pediatric patients, regardless of the indications for sedation/anxiolysis, it is vital to titrate midazolam and other concomitant medications slowly to the desired clinical effect.  The initial dose of midazolam should be administered over 2 to 3 minutes.  Since midazolam is water soluble, it takes approximately three times longer than diazepam to achieve peak EEG effects, therefore one must wait an additional 2 to 3 minutes to fully evaluate the sedative effect before initiating a procedure or repeating a dose.  If further sedation is necessary, continue to titrate with small increments until the appropriate level of sedation is achieved.  If other medications capable of depressing the CNS are coadministered, the peak effect of those concomitant medications must be considered and the dose of midazolam adjusted.  The importance of drug titration to effect is vital to the safe sedation/anxiolysis of the pediatric patient.  The total dose of midazolam will depend on patient response, the type and duration of the procedure, as well as the type and dose of concomitant medications. </p>
