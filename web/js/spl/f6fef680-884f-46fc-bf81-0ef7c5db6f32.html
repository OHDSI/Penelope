<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</h1>
<p class="First">Ifosfamide has been shown to require metabolic activation by                             microsomal liver enzymes to produce biologically active                             metabolites.Â  Activation occurs by hydroxylation at the ring                             carbon atom 4 to form the unstable intermediate                             4-hydroxyifosfamide.Â  This metabolite rapidly degrades to the                             stable urinary metabolite 4-ketoifosfamide.Â  Opening of the                             ring results in formation of the stable urinary metabolite,                             4-carboxyifosfamide.Â  These urinary metabolites have not been                             found to be cytotoxic. N, N-<span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">bis </span></span>(2-chloroethyl)-phosphoric acid diamide (ifosphoramide) and                             acrolein are also found.Â  Enzymatic oxidation of the                             chloroethyl side chains and subsequent dealkylation produces the major                             urinary metabolites, dechloroethyl ifosfamide and dechloroethyl                             cyclophosphamide.Â  The alkylated metabolites of ifosfamide have                             been shown to interact with DNA.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Â In                                     vitro                 </span></span>incubation of DNA with activated ifosfamide has produced                             phosphotriesters.Â  The treatment of intact cell nuclei may also                             result in the formation of DNA-DNA cross-links.Â  DNA repair                             most likely occurs in G-1 and G-2 stage cells.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Ifosfamide exhibits dose-dependent pharmacokinetics in humans.Â  At single doses of 3.8 to 5 g/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, the plasma concentrations decay biphasically and the mean terminal elimination half-life is about 15 hours.Â  At doses of 1.6 to 2.4 g/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, the plasma decay is monoexponential and the terminal elimination half-life is about 7 hours.Â  Ifosfamide is extensively metabolized in humans and the metabolic pathways appear to be saturated at high doses.</p>
<p>After administration of doses of 5 g/m<span class="Sup">2</span> of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-labeled ifosfamide, from 70% to 86% ofÂ  the dosed radioactivity was recovered in the urine, with about 61% of the dose excreted as parent compound.Â  At doses of 1.6 to 2.4 g/m<span class="Sup">2</span> only 12% to 18% of the dose was excreted in the urine as unchanged drug within 72 hours.</p>
<p>Two different dechloroethylated derivatives of ifosfamide, 4-carboxyifosfamide, thiodiacetic acid and cysteine conjugates of chloroacetic acid have been identified as the major urinary metabolites of ifosfamide in humans and only small amounts of 4-hydroxyifosfamide and acrolein are present.Â  Small quantities (nmole/mL) of ifosfamide mustard andÂ  4-hydroxyifosfamide are detectable in human plasma.Â  Metabolism of ifosfamide is required for the generation of the biologically active species and while metabolism is extensive, it is also quite variable among patients.</p>
<p>In a study at Indiana University, 50 fully evaluable patients with germ cell testicular cancer were treated with ifosfamide in combination with cisplatin and either vinblastine or etoposide after failing (47 of 50 patients) at least two prior chemotherapy regimens consisting of cisplatin/vinblastine/bleomycin, (PVB), cisplatin/vinblastine/actinomycin D/bleomycin/cyclophosphamide, (VAB6), or the combination of cisplatin and etoposide.Â  Patients were selected for remaining cisplatin sensitivity because they had previously responded to a cisplatin containing regimen and had not progressed while on the cisplatin containing regimen or within 3 weeks of stopping it.Â  Patients served as their own control based on the premise that long term complete responses could not be achieved by retreatment with a regimen to which they had previously responded and subsequently relapsed.</p>
<p>Ten of 50 fully evaluable patients were still alive 2 to 5 years after treatment.Â  Four of the 10 long term survivors were rendered free of cancer by surgical resection after treatment with the ifosfamide regimen; median survival for the entire group of 50 fully evaluable patients was 53Â  weeks.</p>

<p>In pregnant mice, resorptions increased and anomalies were present at day 19 after a 30 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> dose of ifosfamide was administered on day 11 of gestation.Â  Embryolethal effects were observed in rats following the administration of 54 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> doses of ifosfamide from the 6th through the 15th day of gestation and embryotoxic effects were apparent after dams received 18 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> doses over the same dosing period.Â  Ifosfamide is embryotoxic to rabbits receiving 88 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day doses from the 6th through the 18th day after mating.Â  The number of anomalies was also significantly increased over the control group.</p>

<h2>Preparation for Intravenous Administration/Stability<br>
</h2>
<p class="First">Ifosfamide injection may be diluted to achieve concentrations of 0.6 to 20 mg/mL in the following fluids:</p>
<p>5% Dextrose Injection, USP</p>
<p>0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP</p>
<p>Lactated Ringerâ€™s Injection, USP</p>
<p>Sterile Water for Injection, USP</p>
<p>Because essentially identical stability results were obtained for sterile water admixtures as for the other admixtures (5% Dextrose Injection, 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, and Lactated Ringerâ€™s Injection), the use of large volume parenteral glass bottles, Viaflex bags or PABâ„¢ bags that contain intermediate concentrations or mixtures of excipients (e.g., 2.5% Dextrose Injection, 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, or 5% Dextrose and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection) is also acceptable. </p>
<p>Further diluted solutions of ifosfamide should be refrigerated and used within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.</p>
