<h1><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION</span></h1>
<p class="First">Sterile diagnostic extracts are supplied in either phenol-saline diluent for Intradermal Testing or in diluent containing glycerin 50% (v/v) for Percutaneous Testing and phenol 0.4% (preservative). Inactive ingredients may include: sodium chloride for isotonicity, glycerin, and sodium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span> as a buffer. Inactive ingredients in mold extracts may include residual potassium phosphate, and calcium carbonate from growth media.</p>
<p>Pollens are individually extracted from pure pollen extracted in a phenol-preserved sodium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span> solution. Short Ragweed and Mixed (Tall and Short) Ragweed extracts are standardized by Antigen E content and so labeled. The Antigen E content of extracts containing Short Ragweed at a concentration more dilute than a weight/volume ratio of 1:10 are obtained by calculating the Antigen E content based on the assay value of more concentrated extract. Pollen extracts are filtered aseptically and after final packaging, they are tested for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4035976" conceptname="Sterility">sterility</span> and safety.</p>
<p>Molds (fungi) are present in all inhabited places at all seasons of the year; they are so ubiquitous that they are prevalent at times when common allergic pollens and other inhalants are not. In the home and surroundings, molds are found in upholstered furniture, mattresses, drapes, cellar and storage room dust, woolens, leather goods, fruits, meats, cheeses, garden soil and on plants. Spores, mycelial fragments and mold residues are thus inhaled, contacted and ingested continuously. Mold extracts are extracted in a phenol preserved saline solution. The extract is dialyzed, filtered aseptically and after final packaging, is tested for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4035976" conceptname="Sterility">sterility</span> and safety.</p>
<p>Foods, miscellaneous inhalants and epidermals are individually extracted in phenol preserved saline, filtered aseptically and after final packaging are tested for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4035976" conceptname="Sterility">sterility</span> and safety.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span></h1>
<p class="First">Diagnostically (for skin testing) the allergen combines with IgE antibodies fixed to mast cells in the skin. This complexing causes an increase in cellular permeability and degranulation of the mast cells releasing chemical mediators. These mediators (such as histamine) are responsible for a local inflammatory response of wheal and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span> typical of a positive skin test reaction and also, the symptoms commonly associated with allergic disease.<span class="Sup">1</span> The more mediator release, the larger the reaction (wheal and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span>).</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</span></h1>
<p class="First">These products are for diagnostic use only. Diagnostic allergenic extracts are indicated for use in skin testing to establish the clinical relevance of specific allergens to which the patient has been exposed. By measuring skin test response the physician may assess the degree of sensitivity that patients have to the allergens. For extracts standardized in AU and BAU, see individual directions for use. <span class="Bold">Allergenic extracts for diagnostic use only of coffee, mosquito, cottonseed, and flaxseed have not been shown by adequate data to be safe and effective for therapeutic use.</span></p>

<h2>General:</h2>
<p class="First">In the presence of active symptoms such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4320791" conceptname="Rhinitis">rhinitis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314754" conceptname="Wheezing">wheezing</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">dyspnea</span>, etc., the indications for skin testing must be weighed carefully against the risk of temporarily aggravating the symptoms by the testing itself. Objective assessment of pulmonary function such as Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) before allergen administration and prior to discharge may be useful in unstable <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatics</span> to reduce the chances of exacerbation of the patientâ€™s <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>. Patients should be instructed to describe any active allergic symptoms as described above prior to skin testing and encouraged to report any late reactions from this testing. Also, see <span class="Bold"><a href="#_ADVERSE_REACTIONS">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#_WARNING">WARNING</a></span> sections.</p>
<p>Store allergenic extracts between 2Â°-8Â°C at all times, even during use.</p>
<p>Care must be taken to avoid drawing blood. </p>
<p>A. For percutaneous testing, if blood is observed, immediately wipe the allergen from the site.</p>
<p>B. For intradermal skin testing, pull gently on the syringe plunger and note if any blood enters the syringe. If blood is obtained, reposition the needle and repeat before injecting (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#_DOSAGE_AND_ADMINISTRATION">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>
<p>Allergenic extracts become less potent with age. Allergenic extracts containing glycerin 50% v/v are relatively stable. Non-glycerinated aqueous extracts, particularly dilute forms as used for intradermal skin testing, have been shown to be extremely unstable. Until such time as stability studies are complete with dilute allergens, new intradermal strength materials should be prepared every few weeks.</p>
<p>Use standard aseptic precautions if making dilutions from stock concentrates to intradermal strength.</p>
<p>For intradermal testing: Extracts in glycerin 50% v/v must be diluted with a non-glycerinated diluent and must be diluted at least 25-fold to less than 2% glycerin by volume, as glycerin above this level can cause false positive intradermal skin test results.</p>

<h2>
<span class="Bold">Pregnancy - Category C:</span><span class="Bold">Â </span>
</h2>
<p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with allergenic extracts. It is also not known whether allergenic extracts can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity.</p>
<p>Controlled studies of hyposensitization with moderate to high doses of allergenic extracts during conception and all trimesters of pregnancy have failed to demonstrate any risk to the fetus or to the mother<span class="Sup">4</span>. However, on the basis of histamineâ€™s known ability to contract the uterine muscle, the release of significant amounts of histamine from allergen exposure to skin test <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> should be avoided on theoretical grounds. Therefore, allergenic extracts should be used cautiously in a pregnant woman and only if clearly needed.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions:</span></h2>
<p class="First">Drugs can interfere with the performance of skin tests<span class="Sup">5</span>.</p>
<p>Antihistamines: Response to mediator (histamine) released by allergens is suppressed by antihistamines. The length of suppression varies and is dependent on individual patient, type of antihistamine and length of time the patient has been on antihistamines. The duration of this suppression may be as little as 24 hours (chlorpheniramine), and can be as long as 40 days (astemizole).</p>
<p>Tricyclic Antidepressants: These exert a potent and sustained decrease of skin reactivity to histamine which may last for a few weeks.</p>
<p>Beta2 Agonists: Oral terbutaline and parenteral ephedrine, in general, have been shown to decrease allergen induced wheal.</p>
<p>Dopamine: Intravenous infusion of dopamine may inhibit skin test responses.</p>
<p>Beta Blocking Agents: Propranolol can significantly increase skin test reactivity.</p>
<p>Other Drugs: Short acting steroids, inhaled beta2 agonists, theophylline and cromolyn do not seem to affect skin test response.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span></h1>
<p class="First">Fatalities from skin testing in the United States have been extensively reviewed by Lockey.<span class="Sup">2</span> Six fatalities were associated with intradermal testing without previous percutaneous testing and one was associated with a combination of percutaneous (scratch) and intradermal skin testing. With careful attention to dosage and administration, fatal reactions occur infrequently, but it must be remembered that allergenic extracts are highly potent to sensitive individuals and overdosage could result in anaphylactic symptoms. Therefore it is imperative that physicians administering allergenic extracts for skin testing understand, and be prepared for the treatment of severe reactions.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Local: </span>Immediate wheal and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span> reactions are to be expected; but if very large, may be the first manifestation of a systemic reaction. In such cases, immediately wipe the test site(s) with sterile gauze or cotton to remove excess allergen.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Systemic Reactions:</span> Systemic reactions are characterized by one or more of the following symptoms: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4328356" conceptname="Sneezing">sneezing</span>, mild to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="139900" conceptname="Urticaria">generalized urticaria</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302654" conceptname="Itching">itching</span> (other than at the skin test site), extensive or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4043107" conceptname="Anasarca">generalized edema</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314754" conceptname="Wheezing">wheezing</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">dyspnea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438555" conceptname="Cyanosis">cyanosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">syncope</span>, and upper airway obstruction.

<h1><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span></h1>
<p class="First">Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.</p>
<p>Skin test techniques for immediate (Type I) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> testing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> into two major categories: percutaneous, and intracutaneous.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Percutaneous techniques:</span> For percutaneous testing, in general, skin is scratched, punctured or pricked just before the allergen is applied or through a drop of test allergen. There are several devices available for this technique. Refer to the manufacturer or distributorâ€™s circular for specific directions for their use.</p>
<p>In General:</p>
<p>It is recommended that the test areas should be placed no closer than 4 - 5 cm apart to avoid interference of reactions when several tests are applied.</p>
<p>Skin test areas should be cleansed with alcohol and air dried.</p>
<p>Preferably, the allergen should be placed on the volar surface of the forearm, upper arm, or the patientâ€™s back. The patient should be placed in a comfortable position prior to testing.</p>
<p>For scratch testing, a sharp, clean, sterile instrument is used to abrade the skin, but not to draw blood. Each scratch should be about 2 - 4 mm in length. A small drop of extract is placed on the surface of the skin.</p>
<p>Prick testing: For prick testing, a sharp, sterile instrument is used to puncture the skin slightly, applying it at a 15 - 20Â° angle to the skin. The instrument is gently raised, â€œtentingâ€? the skin until it pops out, generally pricking through the drop of allergen. Do not draw blood.</p>
<p>For puncture testing, a sharp, clean, sterile instrument must be used. Puncture the skin, through the drop of allergen, perpendicular to the skin. Do not draw blood.</p>
<p>For all of the above techniques, a separate instrument must be used for each patient; if the instrument is to be used to pass through the allergen, to avoid cross-contamination, a separate instrument is to be used for each allergen. The test should be read in 15 minutes, measuring both wheal size and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Intracutaneous (intradermal) testing:</span> General: Intradermal testing is more sensitive than percutaneous testing and its specificity is dependent on dose. Intradermal testing is not intended as an initial screen unless used in highly dilute solutions. Intradermal testing is usually reserved for allergens that have demonstrated either negative or equivocal percutaneous skin test response in the face of positive or unclear history.</p>
<p>Intradermal testing of one allergen in several serial dilutions (beginning with the weakest to the more concentrated dilutions) may also be useful in assessing degree of patient sensitivity for the establishment of a safe starting dose for immunotherapy.</p>
<p>Bulk extracts must be diluted for intradermal testing. Use of Sterile Diluent for Allergenic Extracts or Sterile Diluent for Allergenic Extracts Normal Saline with HSA (albumin saline) is recommended. Dilutions should be made with sterile disposable syringes using aseptic technique. Commonly 10 fold dilutions are used to achieve a desired concentration for intradermal testing and continuation of immunotherapy. For example, transferring 0.5 mL of a 10,000 PNU/mL extract into 4.5 mL of diluent will yield 5 mL of extract at 1,000 PNU/mL. For weight volume products, a 1:100 w/v dilution may be prepared from a 1:10 w/v by transferring 0.5 mL of the 1:10 w/v to 4.5 mL of dilutent. Prepare as many additional serial dilutions as necessary to reach the appropriate concentration. As a general rule intradermal strength should begin at no higher than 1/100 to 1/1000 of the percutaneous strength that resulted in a negative skin test reaction.</p>
<p>It is recommended that the test areas should be spaced no less than 5 cm apart to avoid interference with adjacent allergen or control.</p>
<p>Skin should be cleansed with alcohol and air dried.</p>
<p>A sterile 1 mL or 1/2 mL syringe with a 26 - 30 gauge needle should be used. A separate sterile syringe should be used for each extract and each patient.</p>
<p>Care should be taken to eliminate air bubbles from the syringe prior to injecting the test dose. It is suggested that not more than 6 - 10 allergens of each different type be used at any one time. Very sensitive patients may show rapid response.</p>
<p>The skin is held tensely, and the needle is inserted almost parallel to the skin, beveled side up far enough to cover the beveled portion. Slowly inject sufficient extract to make a small bleb of approximately 5 mm in diameter (0.01 - 0.02 mL).</p>
<p>Read the test results in 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Selection of the proper strength for intracutaneous testing: A general rule for the prevention of untoward reactions, particularly in extremely sensitive patients, is to screen by percutaneous methods initially, and begin intradermal testing at a strength not more than 1/100 of a negative or equivocal percutaneous reaction.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Controls:</span> In both percutaneous and intracutaneous tests, a negative control test with diluent alone should be performed because some patients exhibit dermographia, and/or other non-specific irritant responses.</p>
<p>As a positive control in the evaluation of allergenic skin testing, histamine 1 mg/mL (histamine base) should be used for percutaneous testing, and histamine 0.1 mg/mL (histamine base) should be used for intradermal testing.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Interpretation of results: </span>Patientâ€™s response is graded on the basis of the size of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span> or wheal.<span class="Sup">6</span> General guidelines follow for percutaneous testing, different devices and/or techniques influence the size of the reaction, therefore it is important to refer to the device manufacturerâ€™s or distributorâ€™s instructions when grading reactions.</p>
