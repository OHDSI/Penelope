<h2><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></h2>
<p class="First">Leflunomide is an isoxazole immunomodulatory agent which inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (an enzyme involved in de novo pyrimidine synthesis) and has antiproliferative activity. Several <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> and <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> experimental models have demonstrated an anti-inflammatory effect. </p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span></h2>
<p class="First">Following oral administration, leflunomide is metabolized to an active metabolite A77 1726 (hereafter referred to as M1) which is responsible for essentially all of its activity <span class="Italics">in vivo</span>.  Plasma levels of leflunomide are occasionally seen, at very low levels. Studies of the pharmacokinetics of leflunomide have primarily examined the plasma concentrations of this active metabolite. </p>

<h3><span class="Bold Italics">Absorption</span></h3>
<p class="First">Following oral administration, peak levels of the active metabolite, M1, occurred between 6 to 12 hours after dosing. Due to the very long half-life of M1 (~2 weeks), a loading dose of 100 mg for 3 days was used in clinical studies to facilitate the rapid attainment of steady-state levels of M1. Without a loading dose, it is estimated that attainment of steady-state plasma concentrations would require nearly two months of dosing. The resulting plasma concentrations following both loading doses and continued clinical dosing indicate that M1 plasma levels are dose proportional. </p>

<h3><span class="Bold Italics">Distribution </span></h3>
<p class="First">M1 has a low volume of distribution (Vss = 0.13 L/kg) and is extensively bound (&gt;99.3%) to albumin in healthy subjects. Protein binding has been shown to be linear at therapeutic concentrations. The free fraction of M1 is slightly higher in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span> and approximately doubled in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198185" conceptname="Chronic renal failure">chronic renal failure</span>; the mechanism and significance of these increases are unknown. </p>

<h3><span class="Bold Italics">Metabolism </span></h3>
<p class="First">Leflunomide is metabolized to one primary (M1) and many minor metabolites. Of these minor metabolites, only 4-trifluoromethylaniline (TFMA) is quantifiable, occurring at low levels in the plasma of some patients. The parent compound is rarely detectable in plasma. At the present time the specific site of leflunomide metabolism is unknown. <span class="Italics">In vivo</span> and <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies suggest a role for both the GI wall and the liver in drug metabolism. No specific enzyme has been identified as the primary route of metabolism for leflunomide; however, hepatic cytosolic and microsomal cellular fractions have been identified as sites of drug metabolism. </p>

<a name="C_Elimination"></a><a name="section-2.2.4"></a><p></p>
<h3><span class="Bold Italics">Elimination</span></h3>
<p class="First">The active metabolite M1 is eliminated by further metabolism and subsequent renal excretion as well as by direct biliary excretion. In a 28 day study of drug elimination (n=3) using a single dose of radiolabeled compound, approximately 43% of the total radioactivity was eliminated in the urine and 48% was eliminated in the feces. Subsequent analysis of the samples revealed the primary urinary metabolites to be leflunomide glucuronides and an oxanilic acid derivative of M1. The primary fecal metabolite was M1. Of these two routes of elimination, renal elimination is more significant over the first 96 hours after which fecal elimination begins to predominate. In a study involving the intravenous administration of M1, the clearance was estimated to be 31 mL/hr. </p>
<p>In small studies using activated charcoal (n=1) or cholestyramine (n=3) to facilitate drug elimination, the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> plasma half-life of M1 was reduced from &gt;1 week to approximately 1 day (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Need_for_Drug_Elimination">PRECAUTIONS, General,  </a></span><span class="Bold Italics"><a href="#Need_for_Drug_Elimination">Need for Drug Elimination</a></span><span class="Bold"></span>), Similar reductions in plasma half-life were observed for a series of volunteers (n=96) enrolled in pharmacokinetic trials who were given cholestyramine. This suggests that biliary recycling is a major contributor to the long elimination half-life of M1. Studies with both hemodialysis and CAPD (chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis) indicate that M1 is not dialyzable.</p>

<p class="First">Study US301, a 2 year study, randomized 482 patients with active RA of at least 6 months duration to leflunomide 20 mg/day (n=182), methotrexate 7.5 mg/week increasing to 15 mg/week (n=182), or placebo (n=118). All patients received folate 1 mg BID. Primary analysis was at 52 weeks with blinded treatment to 104 weeks.</p>
<p>Overall, 235 of the 508 randomized treated patients (482 in primary data analysis and an additional 26 patients), continued into a second 12 months of double-blind treatment (98 leflunomide, 101 methotrexate, 36 placebo). Leflunomide dose continued at 20 mg/day and the methotrexate dose could be increased to a maximum of 20 mg/week. In total, 190 patients (83 leflunomide, 80 methotrexate, 27 placebo) completed 2 years of double-blind treatment.</p>
<p>The rate and reason for withdrawal is summarized in Table 3.</p>

An extension of the study was an optional 6-month blinded continuation of MN301 without the placebo arm, resulting in a 12-month comparison of leflunomide and sulfasalazine (study MN303).</p>
<p>Of the 168 patients who completed 12 months of treatment in MN301 and MN303, 146 patients (87%) entered a 1-year extension study of double blind active treatment (MN305; 60 leflunomide, 60 sulfasalazine, 26 placebo/sulfasalazine). Patients continued on the same daily dosage of leflunomide or sulfasalazine that they had been taking at the completion of MN301/303. A total of 121 patients (53 leflunomide, 47 sulfasalazine, 21 placebo/sulfasalazine) completed the 2 years of double-blind treatment.</p>

Leflunomide was statistically significantly superior to placebo in reducing the signs and symptoms of RA by the primary efficacy analysis, ACR20 Responder at Endpoint, in study US301 (at the primary 12 months endpoint) and MN301 (at 6 month endpoint). ACR20 Responder at Endpoint rates with leflunomide treatment were consistent across the 6 and 12 month studies (41 to 49%). No consistent differences were demonstrated between leflunomide and methotrexate or between leflunomide and sulfasalazine.

<p class="First">Leflunomide was studied in a single multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled trial in 94 patients (1:1 randomization) with polyarticular course <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4253901" conceptname="Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis">juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</span> (JRA) as defined by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). Approximately 68% of pediatric patients receiving leflunomide, versus 89% of pediatric patients receiving the active comparator, improved by Week 16 (end-of-study) employing the JRA Definition of Improvement (DOI) ≥ 30 % responder endpoint. In this trial, the loading dose and maintenance dose of leflunomide was based on three weight categories: &lt;20 kg, 20 to 40kg, and &gt;40 kg. The response rate to leflunomide in pediatric patients ≤40 kg was less robust than in pediatric patients &gt;40 kg suggesting suboptimal dosing in smaller weight pediatric patients, as studied, resulting in less than efficacious plasma concentrations, despite reduced clearance of M1 (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#C_S_Pediatrics">Pharmacokinetics, </a></span><span class="Bold Italics"><a href="#C_S_Pediatrics">Pediatrics</a></span><span class="Bold"></span>).</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span></h1>
<p class="First">Leflunomide is contraindicated in patients with known <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> to leflunomide or any of the other components of leflunomide. </p>
<p>Leflunomide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Leflunomide, when administered orally to rats during organogenesis at a dose of 15 mg/kg, was teratogenic (most notably <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434143" conceptname="Anophthalmos">anophthalmia</span> or microophthalmia and internal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4043738" conceptname="Hydrocephalus">hydrocephalus</span>). The systemic exposure of rats at this dose was approximately 1/10 the human exposure level based on AUC. Under these exposure conditions, leflunomide also caused a decrease in the maternal body weight and an increase in embryolethality with a decrease in fetal body weight for surviving fetuses. In rabbits, oral treatment with 10 mg/kg of leflunomide during organogenesis resulted in fused, dysplastic sternebrae. The exposure level at this dose was essentially equivalent to the maximum human exposure level based on AUC. At a 1 mg/kg dose, leflunomide was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits.</p>
<p>When female rats were treated with 1.25 mg/kg of leflunomide beginning 14 days before mating and continuing until the end of lactation, the offspring exhibited marked (greater than 90%) decreases in postnatal survival. The systemic exposure level at 1.25 mg/kg was approximately 1/100 the human exposure level based on AUC.</p>
<p>Leflunomide is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.</p>

Patients with pre- existing acute or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">chronic liver disease</span>, or those with serum <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4211515" conceptname="Alanine aminotransferase">alanine aminotransferase</span> (ALT) &gt;2xULN before initiating treatment, should not be treated with leflunomide. Use caution when leflunomide is given with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Monitoring of ALT levels is recommended at least monthly for six months after starting leflunomide, and thereafter every 6 to 8 weeks. If ALT elevation &gt; 3 fold ULN occurs, interrupt leflunomide  therapy while investigating the probable cause of the ALT elevation by close observation and additional tests. If likely leflunomide-induced, start cholestyramine washout and monitor liver tests weekly until normalized (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Need_for_Drug_Elimination">PRECAUTIONS, General</a></span><a href="#Need_for_Drug_Elimination">, </a><span class="Bold Italics"><a href="#Need_for_Drug_Elimination">Need for Drug Elimination</a></span>). If leflunomide-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver injury</span> is unlikely because some other probable cause has been found, resumption of leflunomide therapy may be considered.</p>
<p>In addition, if leflunomide and methotrexate are given concomitantly, ACR guidelines for monitoring methotrexate liver toxicity must be followed with ALT, AST, and serum albumin testing monthly. </p>
<p>In clinical trials, leflunomide treatment as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate was associated with elevations of liver enzymes, primarily ALT and AST, in a significant number of patients; these effects were generally reversible. Most transaminase elevations were mild (≤ 2-fold ULN) and usually resolved while continuing treatment. Marked elevations (&gt;3-fold ULN) occurred infrequently and reversed with dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment. Table 8 shows liver enzyme elevations seen with monthly monitoring in clinical trials US301 and MN301. It was notable that the absence of folate use in MN302 was associated with a considerably greater incidence of liver enzyme elevation on methotrexate.</p>

<p>There have been rare reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432881" conceptname="Pancytopenia">pancytopenia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440689" conceptname="Agranulocytosis">agranulocytosis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span> in patients receiving leflunomide alone. These events have been reported most frequently in patients who received concomitant treatment with methotrexate or other immunosuppressive agents, or who had recently discontinued these therapies; in some cases, patients had a prior history of a significant hematologic abnormality. </p>
<p>Patients taking leflunomide should have platelet, white blood cell count and hemoglobin or hematocrit monitored at baseline and monthly for six months following initiation of therapy and every 6- to 8 weeks thereafter. If used with concomitant methotrexate and/or other potential immunosuppressive agents, chronic monitoring should be monthly.</p>
<p>If evidence of bone marrow suppression occurs in a patient taking leflunomide, treatment with leflunomide should be stopped, and cholestyramine or charcoal should be used to reduce the plasma concentration of leflunomide active metabolite (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Need_for_Drug_Elimination">PRECAUTIONS, General, </a></span><span class="Bold Italics"><a href="#Need_for_Drug_Elimination">Need for Drug Elimination</a></span>).</p>
<p>In any situation in which the decision is made to switch from leflunomide to another anti-rheumatic agent with a known potential for hematologic suppression, it would be prudent to monitor for hematologic toxicity, because there will be overlap of systemic exposure to both compounds. Leflunomide washout with cholestyramine or charcoal may decrease this risk, but also may induce disease worsening if the patient had been responding to leflunomide treatment.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Use in Women of Childbearing Potential</span></h2>
<p class="First">There are no adequate and well-controlled studies evaluating leflunomide in pregnant women.

Women of childbearing potential must not be started on leflunomide until pregnancy is excluded and it has been confirmed that they are using reliable contraception. Before starting treatment with leflunomide, patients must be fully counseled on the potential for serious risk to the fetus.</p>
<p>The patient must be advised that if there is any delay in onset of menses or any other reason to suspect pregnancy, they must notify the physician immediately for pregnancy testing and, if positive, the physician and patient must discuss the risk to the pregnancy. It is possible that rapidly lowering the blood level of the active metabolite by instituting the drug elimination procedure described below at the first delay of menses may decrease the risk to the fetus from leflunomide.</p>
<p>Upon discontinuing leflunomide, it is recommended that all women of childbearing potential undergo the drug elimination procedure described below. Women receiving leflunomide treatment who wish to become pregnant must discontinue leflunomide and undergo the drug elimination procedure described below which includes verification of M1 metabolite plasma levels less than 0.02 mg/L (0.02 mcg/mL). Human plasma levels of the active metabolite (M1) less than 0.02 mg/L (0.02 mcg/mL) are expected to have minimal risk based on available animal data.</p>

<p class="First">The active metabolite of leflunomide is eliminated slowly from the plasma. In instances of any serious toxicity from leflunomide, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span>, use of a drug elimination procedure as described in this section is highly recommended to reduce the drug concentration more rapidly after stopping leflunomide therapy. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> is the suspected clinical mechanism, more prolonged cholestyramine or charcoal administration may be necessary to achieve rapid and sufficient clearance. The duration may be modified based on the clinical status of the patient. </p>
<p>Cholestyramine given orally at a dose of 8 g three times a day for 24 hours to three healthy volunteers decreased plasma levels of M1 by approximately 40% in 24 hours and by 49 to 65% in 48 hours.</p>
<p>Administration of activated charcoal (powder made into a suspension) orally or via nasogastric tube (50 g every 6 hours for 24 hours) has been shown to reduce plasma concentrations of the active metabolite, M1, by 37% in 24 hours and by 48% in 48 hours.</p>
<p>These drug elimination procedures may be repeated if clinically necessary.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold Italics">Hematologic Monitoring</span></h3>

<h3><span class="Bold Italics">Liver Enzyme Monitoring</span></h3>
<p class="First">At minimum, ALT (SGPT) must be performed at baseline and at least monthly for six months after starting leflunomide, and thereafter every 6 to 8 weeks. In addition, if leflunomide and methotrexate are given concomitantly, ACR guidelines for monitoring methotrexate liver toxicity must be followed with ALT, AST, and serum albumin testing every month (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Hepatotoxicity">WARNINGS,  Hepatotoxicity</a></span>).</p>
<p>Due to a specific effect on the brush border of the renal proximal tubule, leflunomide has a uricosuric effect. A separate effect of hypophosphaturia is seen in some patients. These effects have not been seen together, nor have there been alterations in renal function.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold Italics">Cholestyramine and Charcoal</span></h3>
<p class="First">Administration of cholestyramine or activated charcoal in patients (n=13) and volunteers (n=96) resulted in a rapid and significant decrease in plasma M1 (the active metabolite of leflunomide) concentration (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Need_for_Drug_Elimination">PRECAUTIONS, General, </a></span><span class="Bold Italics"><a href="#Need_for_Drug_Elimination">Need for Drug Elimination</a></span><span class="Bold"></span>). </p>

<h3><span class="Bold Italics">Hepatotoxic Drugs</span></h3>
<p class="First">Increased side effects may occur when leflunomide is given concomitantly with hepatotoxic substances. This is also to be considered when leflunomide treatment is followed by such drugs without a drug elimination procedure. In a small (n=30) combination study of leflunomide with methotrexate, a 2- to 3-fold elevation in liver enzymes was seen in 5 of 30 patients. All elevations resolved, 2 with continuation of both drugs and 3 after discontinuation of leflunomide. A &gt;3-fold increase was seen in another 5 patients. All of these also resolved, 2 with continuation of both drugs and 3 after discontinuation of leflunomide. Three patients met "ACR criteria" for liver biopsy (1: Roegnik Grade I, 2: Roegnik Grade IIIa). No <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interaction</span> was identified (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#CLINICAL_PHARMACOLOGY">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span>). </p>

<h3><span class="Bold Italics">Rifampin</span></h3>
<p class="First">Following concomitant administration of a single dose of leflunomide to subjects receiving multiple doses of rifampin, M1 peak levels were increased (~40%) over those seen when leflunomide was given alone. Because of the potential for leflunomide levels to continue to increase with multiple dosing, caution should be used if patients are to be receiving both leflunomide and rifampin.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility</span></h2>
<p class="First">No evidence of carcinogenicity was observed in a 2-year bioassay in rats at oral doses of leflunomide up to the maximally tolerated dose of 6 mg/kg (approximately 1/40 the maximum human M1 systemic exposure based on AUC). However, male mice in a 2-year bioassay exhibited an increased incidence in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> at an oral dose of 15 mg/kg, the highest dose studied (1.7 times the human M1 exposure based on AUC). Female mice, in the same study, exhibited a dose-related increased incidence of bronchoalveolar <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> and carcinomas combined beginning at 1.5 mg/kg (approximately 1/10 the human M1 exposure based on AUC). The significance of the findings in mice relative to the clinical use of leflunomide is not known. </p>
<p>Leflunomide was not mutagenic in the Ames Assay, the Unscheduled DNA Synthesis Assay, or in the HGPRT Gene Mutation Assay. In addition, leflunomide was not clastogenic in the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> Mouse Micronucleus Assay nor in the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> Cytogenetic Test in Chinese Hamster Bone Marrow Cells. However, 4-trifluoromethylaniline (TFMA), a minor metabolite of leflunomide, was mutagenic in the Ames Assay and in the HGPRT Gene Mutation Assay, and was clastogenic in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> Assay for Chromosome Aberrations in the Chinese Hamster Cells. TFMA was not clastogenic in the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> Mouse Micronucleus Assay nor in the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> Cytogenetic Test in Chinese Hamster Bone Marrow Cells. Leflunomide had no effect on fertility in either male or female rats at oral doses up to 4.0 mg/kg (approximately 1/30 the human M1 exposure based on AUC).</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers</span></h2>
<p class="First">Leflunomide should not be used by nursing mothers. It is not known whether leflunomide is excreted in human milk. Many drugs are excreted in human milk, and there is a potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from leflunomide. Therefore, a decision should be made whether to proceed with nursing or to initiate treatment with leflunomide, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Use in Males</span></h2>
<p class="First">Available information does not suggest that leflunomide would be associated with an increased risk of male-mediated fetal toxicity. However, animal studies to evaluate this specific risk have not been conducted. To minimize any possible risk, men wishing to father a child should consider discontinuing use of leflunomide and taking cholestyramine 8 grams 3 times daily for 11 days. </p>

<p class="First">Of the total number of subjects in controlled clinical (Phase III) studies of leflunomide, 234 subjects were 65 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients over 65.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span></h1>
<p class="First">In mouse and rat acute toxicology studies, the minimally toxic dose for oral leflunomide was 200 to 500 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg, respectively (approximately &gt;350 times the maximum recommended human dose, respectively).</p>
<p>There have been reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">chronic overdose</span> in patients taking leflunomide at daily dose up to five times the recommended daily dose and reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">acute overdose</span> in adults or children. There were no adverse events reported in the majority of case reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. Adverse events were consistent with the safety profile for leflunomide (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ADVERSE_REACTIONS">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span>)<span class="Bold">.</span> The most frequent adverse events observed were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435224" conceptname="Leukopenia">leukopenia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span> and elevated liver function tests.</p>
<p>In the event of a significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> or toxicity, cholestyramine or charcoal administration is recommended to accelerate elimination (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Need_for_Drug_Elimination">PRECAUTIONS, General, </a></span><span class="Bold Italics"><a href="#Need_for_Drug_Elimination">Need for Drug Elimination</a></span>) </p>
<p>Studies with both hemodialysis and CAPD (chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis) indicate that M1, the primary metabolite of leflunomide, is not dialyzable (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#C_Elimination">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Elimination</a></span>).</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Loading Dose</span></h2>
<p class="First">Due to the long half-life in patients with RA and recommended dosing interval (24 hours), a loading dose is needed to provide steady-state concentrations more rapidly. It is recommended that leflunomide therapy be initiated with a loading dose of one 100 mg tablet per day for three days.</p>
<p>Elimination of the loading dose regimen may decrease the risk of adverse events. This could be especially important for patients at increased risk of hematologic or hepatic toxicity, such as those receiving concomitant treatment with methotrexate or other immunosuppressive agents or on such medications in the recent past (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Hepatotoxicity">WARNINGS, Hepatotoxicity</a></span>).</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Maintenance Therapy</span></h2>
<p class="First">Daily dosing of 20 mg is recommended for treatment of patients with RA. A small cohort of patients (n=104), treated with 25 mg/day, experienced a greater incidence of side effects; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133280" conceptname="Alopecia">alopecia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span>, liver enzyme elevations. Doses higher than 20 mg/day are not recommended. If dosing at 20 mg/day is not well tolerated clinically, the dose may be decreased to 10 mg daily.  Due to the prolonged half-life of the active metabolite of leflunomide, patients should be carefully observed after dose reduction, since it may take several weeks for metabolite levels to decline. </p>
