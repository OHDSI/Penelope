<h1><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span></h1>
<p class="First">Parlodel<span class="Sup">®</span> (bromocriptine mesylate) is a dopamine receptor agonist, which activates post-synaptic dopamine receptors. The dopaminergic neurons in the tuberoinfundibular process modulate the secretion of prolactin from the anterior pituitary by secreting a prolactin inhibitory factor (thought to be dopamine); in the corpus striatum the dopaminergic neurons are involved in the control of motor function. Clinically, Parlodel significantly reduces plasma levels of prolactin in patients with physiologically elevated prolactin as well as in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030186" conceptname="Hyperprolactinemia">hyperprolactinemia</span>. The inhibition of physiological lactation as well as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79884" conceptname="Galactorrhea not associated with childbirth">galactorrhea</span> in pathological hyperprolactinemic states is obtained at dose levels that do not affect secretion of other tropic hormones from the anterior pituitary. Experiments have demonstrated that bromocriptine induces long-lasting stereotyped behavior in rodents and turning behavior in rats having unilateral lesions in the substantia nigra. These actions, characteristic of those produced by dopamine, are inhibited by dopamine antagonists and suggest a direct action of bromocriptine on striatal dopamine receptors.</p>
<p>Bromocriptine mesylate is a nonhormonal, nonestrogenic agent that inhibits the secretion of prolactin in humans, with little or no effect on other pituitary hormones, except in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4253197" conceptname="Acromegaly">acromegaly</span>, where it lowers elevated blood levels of growth hormone in the majority of patients.</p>
<p>Bromocriptine mesylate produces its therapeutic effect in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, a clinical condition characterized by a progressive deficiency in dopamine synthesis in the substantia nigra, by directly stimulating the dopamine receptors in the corpus striatum. In contrast, levodopa exerts its therapeutic effect only after conversion to dopamine by the neurons of the substantia nigra, which are known to be numerically diminished in this patient population.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p>
<p>Following single dose administration of Parlodel tablets, 2 x 2.5 mg to 5 healthy volunteers under fasted conditions, the mean peak plasma levels of bromocriptine, time to reach peak plasma concentrations and elimination half-life were 465 pg/mL ± 226, 2.5 hrs ± 2 and 4.85 hr, respectively.<span class="Sup">1</span> Linear relationship was found between single doses of Parlodel and C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC in the dose range of 1 to 7.5 mg.<span class="Sup">2</span> The pharmacokinetics of bromocriptine metabolites have not been reported.</p>
<p>Food did not significantly affect the systemic exposure of bromocriptine following administration of Parlodel tablets, 2.5 mg.<span class="Sup">3</span> It is recommended that Parlodel be taken with food because of the high percentage of subjects who vomit upon receiving bromocriptine under fasting conditions.</p>
<p>Following Parlodel 5 mg administered twice daily for 14 days, the bromocriptine C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC at steady state were 628 ± 375 pg/mL and 2377 ± 1186 pg*hr/mL, respectively.<span class="Sup">4</span></p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p>
<p>Bromocriptine undergoes extensive first-pass biotransformation, reflected by complex metabolite profiles and by almost complete absence of parent drug in urine and feces.</p>
<p>In vitro studies using human liver microsomes showed that bromocriptine has a high affinity for CYP3A and hydroxylations at the proline ring of the cyclopeptide moiety constituted a main metabolic pathway.<span class="Sup">5</span> Inhibitors and/or potent substrates for CYP3A4 might therefore inhibit the clearance of bromocriptine and lead to increased levels. (see <a href="#LINK_942385a3-c939-417c-b149-d8c48a51b85c">PRECAUTIONS, drug interactions</a> section). The participation of other major CYP enzymes such as 2D6, 2C8, and 2C19 on the metabolism of bromocriptine has not been evaluated. Bromocriptine is also an inhibitor of CYP3A4 with a calculated IC50 value of 1.69 μM.<span class="Sup">6</span> Given the low therapeutic concentrations of bromocriptine in patients (Cmax=0.82 nM), a significant alteration of the metabolism of a second drug whose clearance is mediated by CYP3A4 should not be expected. The potential effect of bromocriptine and its metabolites to act as inducers of CYP enzymes has not been reported.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Parkinson's Disease</span></h2>
<p class="First">Parlodel SnapTabs<span class="Sup">®</span> or capsules are indicated in the treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic or postencephalitic Parkinson's disease. As adjunctive treatment to levodopa (alone or with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor), Parlodel therapy may provide additional therapeutic benefits in those patients who are currently maintained on optimal dosages of levodopa, those who are beginning to deteriorate (develop tolerance) to levodopa therapy, and those who are experiencing "end of dose failure'' on levodopa therapy. Parlodel therapy may permit a reduction of the maintenance dose of levodopa and, thus may ameliorate the occurrence and/or severity of adverse reactions associated with long-term levodopa therapy such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4319906" conceptname="Dyskinesia">abnormal involuntary movements</span> (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047115" conceptname="Oral dyskinesia">dyskinesias</span>) and the marked swings in motor function ("on-off'' phenomenon). Continued efficacy of Parlodel therapy during treatment of more than 2 years has not been established.</p>
<p>Data are insufficient to evaluate potential benefit from treating newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease with Parlodel. Studies have shown, however, significantly more adverse reactions (notably <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>) in Parlodel-treated patients than in levodopa/carbidopa-treated patients.

<p>If pregnancy occurs during Parlodel administration, careful observation of these patients is mandatory. Prolactin-secreting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> may expand and compression of the optic or other cranial nerves may occur, emergency pituitary surgery becoming necessary. In most cases, the compression resolves following delivery. Reinitiation of Parlodel treatment has been reported to produce improvement in the visual fields of patients in whom <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4164436" conceptname="Peripheral nerve entrapment syndrome">nerve compression</span> has occurred during pregnancy. The safety of Parlodel treatment during pregnancy to the mother and fetus has not been established.</p>
<p>Parlodel has been associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, and episodes of sudden sleep onset, particularly in patients with Parkinson's disease. Sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness or warning signs, has been reported. Patients must be informed of this and advised not to drive or operate machines during treatment with bromocriptine. Patients who have experienced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> and/or an episode of sudden sleep onset must not drive or operate machines. Furthermore, a reduction of dosage or termination of therapy may be considered.</p>
<p>Symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> can occur in patients treated with Parlodel for any indication. In postpartum studies with Parlodel, decreases in supine systolic and diastolic pressures of greater than 20 mm and 10 mm Hg, respectively, have been observed in almost 30% of patients receiving Parlodel.

Because of the possibility of an interaction between Parlodel and other ergot alkaloids, the concomitant use of these medications is not recommended. Periodic monitoring of the blood pressure, particularly during the first weeks of therapy is prudent.

<h2><span class="Bold">Hyperprolactinemic States</span></h2>
<p class="First">Visual field impairment is a known complication of macroprolactinoma. Effective treatment with Parlodel leads to a reduction in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030186" conceptname="Hyperprolactinemia">hyperprolactinemia</span> and often to a resolution of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373786" conceptname="Abnormal vision">visual impairment</span>. In some patients, however, a secondary deterioration of visual fields may subsequently develop despite normalized prolactin levels and tumor shrinkage, which may result from traction on the optic chiasm which is pulled down into the now partially empty sella. In these cases, the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377286" conceptname="Visual field defect">visual field defect</span> may improve on reduction of bromocriptine dosage while there is some elevation of prolactin and some tumor re-expansion. Monitoring of visual fields in patients with macroprolactinoma is therefore recommended for an early recognition of secondary field loss due to chiasmal herniation and adaptation of drug dosage.</p>
<p>The relative efficacy of Parlodel versus surgery in preserving visual fields is not known. Patients with rapidly progressive visual field loss should be evaluated by a neurosurgeon to help decide on the most appropriate therapy.</p>
<p>Since pregnancy is often the therapeutic objective in many hyperprolactinemic patients presenting with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443800" conceptname="Amenorrhea">amenorrhea</span>/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79884" conceptname="Galactorrhea not associated with childbirth">galactorrhea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4167354" conceptname="Hypogonadism">hypogonadism</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4035976" conceptname="Sterility">infertility</span>), a careful assessment of the pituitary is essential to detect the presence of a prolactin-secreting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenoma</span>. Patients not seeking pregnancy, or those harboring large <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span>, should be advised to use contraceptive measures, other than oral contraceptives, during treatment with Parlodel. Since pregnancy may occur prior to reinitiation of menses, a pregnancy test is recommended at least every 4 weeks during the amenorrheic period, and, once menses are reinitiated, every time a patient misses a menstrual period. Treatment with Parlodel SnapTabs<span class="Sup">®</span> or capsules should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy has been established. Patients must be monitored closely throughout pregnancy for signs and symptoms that may signal the enlargement of a previously undetected or existing prolactin-secreting tumor. Discontinuation of Parlodel treatment in patients with known macroadenomas has been associated with rapid regrowth of tumor and increase in serum prolactin in most cases.</p>

<p>Postmarketing reports suggest that patients treated with anti-Parkinson medications can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money uncontrollably, and other intense urges. Patients may be unable to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and that increase central dopaminergic tone, including Parlodel. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4023166" conceptname="Gambling">gambling</span> urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending or other urges while being treated with Parlodel. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking Parlodel.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></h2>
<p class="First">The risk of using Parlodel in combination with other drugs has not been systematically evaluated, but alcohol may potentiate the side effects of Parlodel. Parlodel may interact with dopamine antagonists, butyrophenones, and certain other agents. Compounds in these categories result in a decreased efficacy of Parlodel: phenothiazines, haloperidol, metoclopramide, pimozide. Bromocriptine is a substrate of CYP3A4. Caution should therefore be used when co-administering drugs which are strong inhibitors of this enzyme (such as azole antimycotics, HIV protease inhibitors). The concomitant use of macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin was shown to increase the plasma levels of bromocriptine (mean AUC and Cmax values increased 3.7-fold and 4.6-fold, respectively).<span class="Sup">1</span> The concomitant treatment of acromegalic patients with bromocriptine and octreotide led to increased plasma levels of bromocriptine (bromocriptine AUC increased about 38%).<span class="Sup">4</span> Concomitant use of Parlodel with other ergot alkaloids is not recommended. Dose adjustment may be necessary in those cases where high doses of bromocriptine are being used (such as Parkinson's disease indication).</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</span></h2>
<p class="First">A 74-week study was conducted in mice using dietary levels of bromocriptine mesylate equivalent to oral doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg/day. A 100-week study in rats was conducted using dietary levels equivalent to oral doses of 1.7, 9.8, and 44 mg/kg/day. The highest doses tested in mice and rats were approximately 2.5 and 4.4 times, respectively, the maximum human dose administered in controlled clinical trials (100 mg/day) based on body surface area. Malignant uterine tumors, endometrial and myometrial, were found in rats as follows: 0/50 control females, 2/50 females given 1.7 mg/kg daily, 7/49 females given 9.8 mg/kg daily, and 9/50 females given 44 mg/kg daily. The occurrence of these neoplasms is probably attributable to the high estrogen/progesterone ratio which occurs in rats as a result of the prolactin-inhibiting action of bromocriptine mesylate. The endocrine mechanisms believed to be involved in the rats are not present in humans. There is no known correlation between uterine malignancies occurring in bromocriptine-treated rats and human risk. In contrast to the findings in rats, the uteri from mice killed after 74 weeks of treatment did not exhibit evidence of drug-related changes.</p>
<p>Bromocriptine mesylate was evaluated for mutagenic potential in the battery of tests that included Ames bacterial mutation assay, mutagenic activity <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> on V79 Chinese hamster fibroblasts, cytogenetic analysis of Chinese hamster bone marrow cells following <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> treatment, and an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> micronucleus test for mutagenic potential in mice.</p>
<p>No mutagenic effects were obtained in any of these tests.</p>
<p>Fertility and reproductive performance in female rats were not influenced adversely by treatment with bromocriptine beyond the predicted decrease in the weight of pups due to suppression of lactation. In males treated with 50 mg/kg of this drug, mating and fertility were within the normal range. Increased perinatal loss was produced in the subgroups of dams, sacrificed on day 21 postpartum (p.p.) after mating with males treated with the highest dose (50 mg/kg).</p>

Three mg/kg given on days 6-15 were without effect on nidation, and did not produce any anomalies. In animals treated from day 8-15 p.c., i.e., after implantation, 30 mg/kg produced increased prenatal mortality in the form of increased incidence of embryonic resorption. One anomaly, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4166825" conceptname="Aplasia">aplasia</span> of spinal vertebrae and ribs, was found in the group of 262 fetuses derived from the dams treated with 30 mg/kg bromocriptine.

<p>Two studies were conducted in rabbits (2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span>) to determine the potential to interfere with nidation. Dose levels of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day from day 1 to day 6 p.c. did not adversely affect nidation. The high dose was approximately 63 times the maximum human dose administered in controlled clinical trials (100 mg/day), based on body surface area. In New Zealand white rabbits, some embryo mortality occurred at 300 mg/kg which was a reflection of overt maternal toxicity. Three studies were conducted in 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> of rabbits to determine the teratological potential of bromocriptine at dose levels of 3, 10, 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg given from day 6 to day 18 p.c. In 2 studies with the Yellow-silver <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135923" conceptname="Cleft palate">cleft palate</span> was found in 3 and 2 fetuses at maternally toxic doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg, respectively. One control fetus also exhibited this anomaly. In the third study conducted with New Zealand white rabbits using an identical protocol, no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135923" conceptname="Cleft palate">cleft palates</span> were produced.</p>
<p>No teratological or embryotoxic effects of bromocriptine were produced in any of 6 offspring from 6 monkeys at a dose level of 2 mg/kg.</p>
<p>Information concerning 1276 pregnancies in women taking Parlodel has been collected. In the majority of cases, Parlodel was discontinued within 8 weeks into pregnancy (mean 28.7 days), however, 8 patients received the drug continuously throughout pregnancy. The mean daily dose for all patients was 5.8 mg (range 1-40 mg).</p>
<p>Of these 1276 pregnancies, there were 1088 full-term deliveries (4 stillborn), 145 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4067106" conceptname="Miscarriage">spontaneous abortions</span> (11.4%), and 28 induced abortions (2.2%). Moreover, 12 extrauterine gravidities and 3 hydatidiform moles (twice in the same patient) caused early termination of pregnancy. These data compare favorably with the abortion rate (11%-25%) cited for pregnancies induced by clomiphene citrate, menopausal gonadotropin, and chorionic gonadotropin.</p>
<p>Although <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4067106" conceptname="Miscarriage">spontaneous abortions</span> often go unreported, especially prior to 20 weeks of gestation, their frequency has been estimated to be 15%.</p>
<p>The incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span> in the population at large ranges from 2%-4.5%. The incidence in 1109 live births from patients receiving bromocriptine is 3.3%.</p>
<p>There is no suggestion that Parlodel contributed to the type or incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span> in this group of infants.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Geriatric Use</span></h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies for Parlodel did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether the elderly respond differently from younger subjects. However, other reported clinical experiences, including postmarketing reporting of adverse events, have not identified differences in response or tolerability between elderly and younger patients. Even though no variation in efficacy or adverse reaction profile in geriatric patients taking Parlodel has been observed, greater sensitivity of some elderly individuals cannot be categorically ruled out. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, starting at the lower end of the dose range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in this population.</p>

<p>In postpartum studies with Parlodel, 23 percent of postpartum patients treated had at least 1 side effect, but they were generally mild to moderate in degree. Therapy was discontinued in approximately 3% of patients. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions were: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> (10%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span> (8%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> (7%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> (3%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span> (1.0%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">syncope</span> (0.7%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span> (0.4%) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75635" conceptname="Cramp">cramps</span> (0.4%). Decreases in blood pressure (≥ 20 mm Hg systolic and ≥ 10 mm Hg diastolic) occurred in 28% of patients at least once during the first 3 postpartum days; these were usually of a transient nature. Reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">fainting</span> in the puerperium may possibly be related to this effect. In postmarketing experience in the U.S., serious adverse reactions reported include 72 cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> (including 4 cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span>), 30 cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, and 9 cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> among postpartum patients. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">Seizure</span> cases were not necessarily accompanied by the development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>.

Most patients had shown no evidence of any of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443700" conceptname="Eclampsia">eclampsia</span>, preeclampsia or pregnancy-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>. One <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> case was associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4290940" conceptname="Thrombosis of superior sagittal sinus">sagittal sinus thrombosis</span>, and another was associated with cerebral and cerebellar <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137275" conceptname="Vasculitis">vasculitis</span>. One case of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> was associated with unexplained <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436093" conceptname="Disseminated intravascular coagulation">disseminated intravascular coagulation</span> and a second occurred in conjunction with use of another ergot alkaloid. The relationship of these adverse reactions to Parlodel administration has not been established.</p>
<p>In rare cases serious adverse events, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, or psychic disorders have been reported in postpartum women treated with Parlodel. In some patients the development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> was preceded by severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> and/or transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="374034" conceptname="Visual disturbance">visual disturbances</span>. Although the causal relationship of these events to the drug is uncertain, periodic monitoring of blood pressure is advisable in postpartum women receiving Parlodel. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, severe, progressive, or unremitting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> (with or without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="374034" conceptname="Visual disturbance">visual disturbances</span>), or evidence of CNS toxicity develop, the administration of Parlodel should be discontinued and the patient should be evaluated promptly.</p>
<p>Particular caution is required in patients who have recently been treated or are on concomitant therapy with drugs that can alter blood pressure, e.g. vasoconstrictors such as sympathomimetics or ergot alkaloids including ergometrine or methylergometrine and their concomitant use in the puerperium is not recommended.</p>

<p>Treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> consists of removal of the drug by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> (if conscious), gastric lavage, activated charcoal, or saline catharsis. Careful supervision and recording of fluid intake and output is essential. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> should be treated by placing the patient in the Trendelenburg position and administering I.V. fluids. If satisfactory relief of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> cannot be achieved by using the above measures to their fullest extent, vasopressors should be considered.</p>

<p class="First">It is recommended that Parlodel<span class="Sup">®</span> (bromocriptine mesylate) be taken with food. Patients should be evaluated frequently during dose escalation to determine the lowest dosage that produces a therapeutic response.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Hyperprolactinemic Indications</span></h2>
<p class="First">The initial dosage of Parlodel SnapTabs<span class="Sup">®</span> in adults is ½ to one 2½ mg scored tablet daily. An additional 2½ mg tablet may be added to the treatment regimen as tolerated every 2-7 days until an optimal therapeutic response is achieved. The therapeutic dosage ranged from 2.5-15 mg daily in adults studied clinically.</p>
<p>Based on limited data in children of age 11 to 15, (see <a href="#LINK_8980b70f-9454-48ff-a7a5-9b6cd82cfb5c">Pediatric Use</a>) the initial dose is ½ to one 2½ mg scored tablet daily. Dosing may need to be increased as tolerated until a therapeutic response is achieved.

<p>In order to reduce the likelihood of prolonged exposure to Parlodel should an unsuspected pregnancy occur, a mechanical contraceptive should be used in conjunction with Parlodel therapy until normal ovulatory menstrual cycles have been restored. Contraception may then be discontinued in patients desiring pregnancy.</p>
<p>Thereafter, if menstruation does not occur within 3 days of the expected date, Parlodel therapy should be discontinued and a pregnancy test performed.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4253197" conceptname="Acromegaly">Acromegaly</span></span></h2>
<p class="First">Virtually all acromegalic patients receiving therapeutic benefit from Parlodel also have reductions in circulating levels of growth hormone. Therefore, periodic assessment of circulating levels of growth hormone will, in most cases, serve as a guide in determining the therapeutic potential of Parlodel. If, after a brief trial with Parlodel therapy, no significant reduction in growth hormone levels has taken place, careful assessment of the clinical features of the disease should be made, and if no change has occurred, dosage adjustment or discontinuation of therapy should be considered.</p>
<p>The initial recommended dosage is ½ to one 2½ mg Parlodel SnapTabs tablet on retiring (with food) for 3 days. An additional ½ to 1 SnapTabs tablet should be added to the treatment regimen as tolerated every 3-7 days until the patient obtains optimal therapeutic benefit. Patients should be reevaluated monthly and the dosage adjusted based on reductions of growth hormone or clinical response. The usual optimal therapeutic dosage range of Parlodel varies from 20-30 mg/day in most patients. The maximal dosage should not exceed 100 mg/day.</p>
<p>Patients treated with pituitary irradiation should be withdrawn from Parlodel therapy on a yearly basis to assess both the clinical effects of radiation on the disease process as well as the effects of Parlodel therapy. Usually a 4-8 week withdrawal period is adequate for this purpose. Recurrence of the signs/symptoms or increases in growth hormone indicate the disease process is still active and further courses of Parlodel should be considered.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Parkinson's Disease</span></h2>
<p class="First">The basic principle of Parlodel therapy is to initiate treatment at a low dosage and, on an individual basis, increase the daily dosage slowly until a maximum therapeutic response is achieved. The dosage of levodopa during this introductory period should be maintained, if possible. The initial dose of Parlodel is ½ of a 2½ mg SnapTabs tablet twice daily with meals. Assessments are advised at 2-week intervals during dosage titration to ensure that the lowest dosage producing an optimal therapeutic response is not exceeded. If necessary, the dosage may be increased every 14-28 days by 2½ mg/day with meals. Should it be advisable to reduce the dosage of levodopa because of adverse reactions, the daily dosage of Parlodel, if increased, should be accomplished gradually in small (2½ mg) increments.</p>
<p>The safety of Parlodel has not been demonstrated in dosages exceeding 100 mg/day.</p>
