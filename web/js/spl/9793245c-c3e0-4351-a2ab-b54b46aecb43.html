<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-3.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">The mechanism of action of ciclopirox has been investigated using various <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> models. One <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> study suggested that ciclopirox acts by chelation of polyvalent cations (Fe<span class="Sup">+3</span> or Al<span class="Sup">+3</span>) resulting in the inhibition of the metal-dependent enzymes that are responsible for the degradation of peroxides within the fungal cell.  The clinical significance of this observation is not known. </p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-3.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Activity in vitro and ex vivo</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> methodologies employing various broth or solid media with and without additional nutrients have been utilized to determine ciclopirox <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4190299" conceptname="Broth microdilution susceptibility test">minimum inhibitory concentration</span> (MIC) values for the dermatophytic molds.<span class="Sup">(1–2)</span> As a consequence, a broad range of MIC values, 1–20 ug/mL, were obtained for <span class="Italics">Trichophyton rubrum</span> and <span class="Italics">Trichophyton mentagrophytes</span> species. Correlation between <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> MIC results and clinical outcome has yet to be established for ciclopirox.</p>
<p>One <span class="Italics">ex vivo</span> study was conducted evaluating 8% ciclopirox against new and established <span class="Italics">Trichophyton rubrum</span> and <span class="Italics">Trichophyton mentagrophytes</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> in ovine hoof material.<span class="Sup">(3)</span> After 10 days of treatment the growth of <span class="Italics">T. rubrum</span> and <span class="Italics">T. mentagrophytes</span> in the established <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> model was very minimally affected. Elimination of the molds from hoof material was not achieved in either the new or established <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> models.</p>

<h2>Susceptibility testing for Trichophyton rubrum species</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> susceptibility testing methods for determining ciclopirox MIC values against the dermatophytic molds, including <span class="Italics">Trichophyton rubrum</span> species, have not been standardized or validated.  Ciclopirox MIC values will vary depending on the susceptibility testing method employed, composition and pH of media and the utilization of nutritional supplements. Breakpoints to determine whether clinical isolates of <span class="Italics">Trichophyton rubrum</span> are susceptible or resistant to ciclopirox have not been established. </p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-3.5"></a><p></p>
<h2>Resistance </h2>

<h2>Antifungal Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">No studies have been conducted to determine whether ciclopirox might reduce the effectiveness of systemic antifungal agents for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4215978" conceptname="Onychomycosis">onychomycosis</span>.  Therefore, the concomitant use of 8% ciclopirox topical solution and systemic antifungal agents for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4215978" conceptname="Onychomycosis">onychomycosis</span> is not recommended.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">As demonstrated in pharmacokinetic studies in animals and man, ciclopirox olamine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and completely eliminated in all species via feces and urine.  Most of the compound is excreted either unchanged or as glucuronide.  After oral administration of 10 mg of radiolabeled drug (14C-ciclopirox) to healthy volunteers, approximately 96% of the radioactivity was excreted renally within 12 hours of administration.  Ninety-four percent of the renally excreted radioactivity was in the form of glucuronides.  Thus, glucuronidation is the main metabolic pathway of this compound.</p>
<p>Systemic absorption of ciclopirox was determined in 5 patients with dermatophytic onychomycoses, after application of PENLAC<span class="Sup">®</span> NAIL LACQUER (ciclopirox) Topical Solution, 8%, to all 20 digits and adjacent 5 mm of skin once daily for six months.  Random serum concentrations and 24 hour urinary excretion of ciclopirox were determined at two weeks and at 1, 2, 4 and 6 months after initiation of treatment and 4 weeks post-treatment.  In this study, ciclopirox serum levels ranged from 12–80 ng/mL.  Based on urinary data, mean absorption of ciclopirox from the dosage form was &lt;5% of the applied dose.  One month after cessation of treatment, serum and urine levels of ciclopirox were below the limit of detection. </p>
<p>In two vehicle-controlled trials, patients applied PENLAC<span class="Sup">®</span> NAIL LACQUER (ciclopirox) Topical Solution, 8%, to all toenails and affected fingernails.  Out of a total of 66 randomly selected patients on active treatment, 24 had detectable serum ciclopirox concentrations at some point during the dosing interval (range 10.0–24.6 ng/mL).  It should be noted that eleven of these 24 patients took concomitant medication containing ciclopirox as ciclopirox olamine (Loprox<span class="Sup">®</span> Cream, 0.77%).</p>
<p>The penetration of the PENLAC<span class="Sup">®</span> NAIL LACQUER (ciclopirox) Topical Solution, 8%, was evaluated in an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> investigation.  Radiolabeled ciclopirox applied once to onychomycotic toenails that were avulsed demonstrated penetration up to a depth of approximately 0.4 mm.  As expected, nail plate concentrations decreased as a function of nail depth.  The clinical significance of these findings in nail plates is unknown.  Nail bed concentrations were not determined.</p>

<h2>Clinical Trials Data</h2>
<p class="First">The results of use of PENLAC<span class="Sup">®</span> NAIL LACQUER (ciclopirox) Topical Solution, 8%, in treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4215978" conceptname="Onychomycosis">onychomycosis</span> of the toenail without lunula involvement were obtained from two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies conducted in the US.  In these studies, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4215978" conceptname="Onychomycosis">onychomycosis</span> of the great toenails without lunula involvement were treated with ciclopirox topical solution, 8% in conjunction with monthly removal of the unattached, infected toenail by the investigator.  PENLAC<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> NAIL LACQUER (ciclopirox) Topical Solution, 8%, was applied for 48 weeks.  At baseline, patients had 20–65% involvement of the target great toenail plate.  Statistical significance was demonstrated in one of two studies for the endpoint "complete cure" (clear nail and negative mycology), and in two studies for the endpoint "almost clear"  (≤10% nail involvement and negative mycology) at the end of study.

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">No carcinogenicity study was conducted with PENLAC<span class="Sup">®</span> NAIL LACQUER (ciclopirox) Topical Solution, 8%, formulation. A carcinogenicity study of ciclopirox (1% and 5% solutions in polyethylene glycol 400) in female mice dosed topically twice per week for 50 weeks followed by a 6-month drug-free observation period prior to necropsy revealed no evidence of tumors at the application sites.</p>
<p>In human systemic tolerability studies following daily application (~340 mg of PENLAC<span class="Sup">®</span> NAIL LACQUER (ciclopirox) Topical Solution, 8%) in subjects with distal subungual <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4215978" conceptname="Onychomycosis">onychomycosis</span>, the average maximal serum level of ciclopirox was 31±28 ng/mL after two months of once daily applications. This level was 159 times lower than the lowest toxic dose and 115 times lower than the highest nontoxic dose in rats and dogs fed 7.7 and 23.1 mg ciclopirox (as ciclopirox olamine)/kg/day.</p>
<p>The following <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> genotoxicity tests have been conducted with ciclopirox: evaluation of gene mutation in Ames <span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span></span> and <span class="Italics">E. coli</span> assays (negative); chromosome aberration assays in V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts, with and without metabolic activation (positive); gene mutation assay in the HGPRT-test with V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (negative); unscheduled DNA synthesis in human A549 cells (negative); and BALB/c3T3 cell transformation assay (negative). In an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> Chinese hamster bone marrow cytogenetic assay, ciclopirox was negative for chromosome aberrations at 5,000 mg/kg.</p>
<p>The following <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> genotoxicity tests were conducted with PENLAC <span class="Sup">®</span>NAIL LACQUER (ciclopirox) Topical Solution, 8%: Ames <span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span></span> test (negative); unscheduled DNA synthesis in the rat hepatocytes (negative); cell transformation assay in BALB/c3T3 cell assay (positive). The positive response of the lacquer formulation in the BALB/c3T3 test was attributed to its butyl monoester of poly[methylvinyl ether/maleic acid] resin component (Gantrez<span class="Sup">®</span> ES-435), which also tested positive in this test. The cell transformation assay may have been confounded because of the film-forming nature of the resin. Gantrez<span class="Sup">®</span> ES-435 tested nonmutagenic in both the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> forward mutation assay with or without activation and unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in rat hepatocytes. </p>
<p>Oral reproduction studies in rats at doses up to 3.85 mg ciclopirox (as ciclopirox olamine)/kg/day [equivalent to approximately 1.4 times the potential exposure at the maximum recommended human topical dose (MRHTD)] did not reveal any specific effects on fertility or other reproductive parameters. MRHTD (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) is based on the assumption of 100% systemic absorption of 27.12 mg ciclopirox (~340 mg PENLAC<span class="Sup">®</span> NAIL LACQUER (ciclopirox) Topical Solution, 8%) that will cover all the fingernails and toenails including 5 mm proximal and lateral fold area plus <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4328079" conceptname="Onycholysis">onycholysis</span> to a maximal extent of 50%.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">In the vehicle-controlled clinical trials conducted in the US, 9% (30/327) of patients treated with PENLAC <span class="Sup">®</span>NAIL LACQUER (ciclopirox) Topical Solution, 8%, and 7% (23/328) of patients treated with vehicle reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) considered by the investigator to be causally related to the test material.</p>
<p>The incidence of these adverse events, within each body system, was similar between the treatment groups except for Skin and Appendages: 8% (27/327) and 4% (14/328) of subjects in the ciclopirox and vehicle groups reported at least one adverse event, respectively. The most common were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>-related adverse events: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">periungual erythema</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span> of the proximal nail fold were reported more frequently in patients treated with PENLAC<span class="Sup">®</span> NAIL LACQUER (ciclopirox) Topical Solution, 8%, (5% [16/327]) than in patients treated with vehicle (1% [3/328]). Other TEAEs thought to be causally related included <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4211923" conceptname="Nail changes">nail disorders</span> such as shape change, irritation, ingrown toenail, and discoloration.</p>
<p>The incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4211923" conceptname="Nail changes">nail disorders</span> was similar between the treatment groups (2% [6/327] in the PENLAC<span class="Sup">®</span> NAIL LACQUER (ciclopirox) Topical Solution, 8%, group and 2% [7/328] in the vehicle group). Moreover, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4319310" conceptname="Application site reaction">application site reactions</span> and/or burning of the skin occurred in 1% of patients treated with PENLAC<span class="Sup">®</span> NAIL LACQUER (ciclopirox) Topical Solution, 8%, (3/327) and vehicle (4/328). </p>
<p>A 21-Day Cumulative Irritancy study was conducted under conditions of semi-occlusion. Mild reactions were seen in 46% of patients with the PENLAC<span class="Sup">®</span> NAIL LACQUER (ciclopirox) Topical Solution, 8%, 32% with the vehicle and 2% with the negative control, but all were reactions of mild transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span>. There was no evidence of allergic contact sensitization for either the PENLAC<span class="Sup">®</span> NAIL LACQUER (ciclopirox) Topical Solution, 8%, or the vehicle base. In a separate study of the photosensitization potential of PENLAC® NAIL LACQUER (ciclopirox) Topical Solution, 8% in a maximized test design that included the occluded application of sodium lauryl sulfate, no photoallergic reactions were noted. In four subjects localized allergic contact reactions were observed. In the vehicle-controlled studies, one patient treated with PENLAC<span class="Sup">®</span> NAIL LACQUER (ciclopirox) Topical Solution, 8%, discontinued treatment due to a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>, localized to the palm (causal relation to test material undetermined). </p>
<p>Use of PENLAC<span class="Sup">®</span> NAIL LACQUER (ciclopirox) Topical Solution, 8%, for 48 additional weeks was evaluated in an open-label extension study conducted in patients previously treated in the vehicle-controlled studies. Three percent (9/281) of subjects treated with PENLAC<span class="Sup">®</span> NAIL LACQUER (ciclopirox) Topical Solution, 8%, experienced at least one TEAE that the investigator thought was causally related to the test material. Mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> in the form of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">periungual erythema</span> (1% [2/281]) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4211923" conceptname="Nail changes">nail disorders</span> (1% [4/281]) were the most frequently reported. Four patients discontinued because of TEAEs. Two of the four had events considered to be related to test material: one patient's great toenail "broke away" and another had an elevated creatine phosphokinase level on Day 1 (after 48 weeks of treatment with vehicle in the previous vehicle-controlled study).</p>
