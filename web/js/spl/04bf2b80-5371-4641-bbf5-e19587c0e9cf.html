<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Pramipexole is a nonergot dopamine agonist with high relative <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> specificity and full intrinsic activity at the D<span class="Sub">2</span> subfamily of dopamine receptors, binding with higher affinity to D<span class="Sub">3</span> than to D<span class="Sub">2</span> or D<span class="Sub">4</span> receptor subtypes.  </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Parkinson’s Disease:</span> The precise mechanism of action of pramipexole as a treatment for Parkinson's disease is unknown, although it is believed to be related to its ability to stimulate dopamine receptors in the striatum. This conclusion is supported by electrophysiologic studies in animals that have demonstrated that pramipexole influences striatal neuronal firing rates via activation of dopamine receptors in the striatum and the substantia nigra, the site of neurons that send projections to the striatum.  The relevance of D<span class="Sub">3</span> receptor binding in Parkinson’s disease is unknown.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Pramipexole displays linear pharmacokinetics over the clinical dosage range.  Its terminal half-life is about 8 hours in young healthy volunteers and about 12 hours in elderly volunteers (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY,<a href="#i4i_section_id_72e825d4-522e-4e9a-9941-65de25c96320">Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations</a>). Steady-state concentrations are achieved within 2 days of dosing.</p>

<h3>Absorption</h3>
<p class="First">Pramipexole is rapidly absorbed, reaching peak concentrations in approximately 2 hours. The absolute bioavailability of pramipexole is greater than 90%, indicating that it is well absorbed and undergoes little presystemic metabolism. Food does not affect the extent of pramipexole absorption, although the time of maximum plasma concentration (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) is increased by about 1 hour when the drug is taken with a meal.</p>

<h3>Distribution</h3>
<p class="First">Pramipexole is extensively distributed, having a volume of distribution of about 500 L (coefficient of variation [CV]=20%). It is about 15% bound to plasma proteins. Pramipexole distributes into red blood cells as indicated by an erythrocyte to  plasma ratio of approximately two.</p>

<h3>Metabolism and Elimination</h3>
<p class="First">The terminal half-life of pramipexole is about 8 hours in healthy volunteers and 12 hours in elderly volunteers. </p>
<p>Urinary excretion is the major route of pramipexole elimination, with 90% of a pramipexole dose recovered in urine, almost all as unchanged drug. Nonrenal routes may contribute to a small extent to pramipexole elimination, although no metabolites have been identified in plasma or urine. The renal clearance of pramipexole is approximately 400 mL/min (CV=25%), approximately three times higher than the glomerular filtration rate. Thus, pramipexole is secreted by the renal tubules, probably by the organic cation transport system.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations</h2>
<p class="First">Because therapy with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets is initiated at a low dose and gradually titrated upward according to clinical tolerability to obtain the optimum therapeutic effect, adjustment of the initial dose based on gender, weight, or age is not necessary. However, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>, which can cause a large decrease in the ability to eliminate pramipexole, may necessitate dosage adjustment (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, <a href="#i4i_section_id_d8e8e3ad-0ef4-464a-8993-6f79920f766a"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span></a>).</p>

<h3>Gender</h3>
<p class="First">Pramipexole clearance is about 30% lower in women than in men, but most of this difference can be accounted for by differences in body weight. There is no difference in half-life between males and females.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="i4i_section_id_14c1d6a1-0a58-434b-acb3-f74cafe74487"></a><a name="section-3.3.2"></a><p></p>
<h3>Age</h3>
<p class="First">Pramipexole clearance decreases with age as the half-life and clearance are about 40% longer and 30% lower, respectively, in elderly (aged 65 years or older) compared with young healthy volunteers (aged less than 40 years). This difference is most likely due to the well-known reduction in renal function with age, since pramipexole clearance is correlated with renal function, as measured by creatinine clearance (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, <a href="#i4i_section_id_d8e8e3ad-0ef4-464a-8993-6f79920f766a"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span></a>).</p>

<h3>Parkinson's Disease Patients</h3>
<p class="First">A cross-study comparison of data suggests that the clearance of pramipexole may be reduced by about 30% in Parkinson's disease patients compared with healthy elderly volunteers. The reason for this difference appears to be reduced renal function in Parkinson's disease patients, which may be related to their poorer general health. The pharmacokinetics of pramipexole were comparable between early and advanced Parkinson's disease patients.</p>

<h3><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">Hepatic Insufficiency</span></h3>
<p class="First">The influence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic insufficiency</span> on pramipexole pharmacokinetics has not been evaluated. Because approximately 90% of the recovered dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> would not be expected to have a significant effect on pramipexole elimination.</p>

<h3><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span></h3>
<p class="First">The clearance of pramipexole was about 75% lower in patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (creatinine clearance approximately 20 mL/min) and about 60% lower in patients with moderate impairment (creatinine clearance approximately 40 mL/min) compared with healthy volunteers.  Also, it took longer to achieve steady-state. A lower starting and/or maintenance dose may be appropriate in these patients (see <a href="#i4i_precautions_id_60ed3c2c-badb-4603-bbc5-64f43379338d">PRECAUTIONS</a> and <a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_f2bbde56-2b96-460c-8677-68e37388ffed">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>). In patients with varying degrees of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, pramipexole clearance correlates well with creatinine clearance. Therefore, creatinine clearance can be used as a predictor of the extent of decrease in pramipexole clearance. Pramipexole clearance is extremely low in dialysis patients, as a negligible amount of pramipexole is removed by dialysis. Caution should be exercised when administering pramipexole to patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>.</p>

<h2>Parkinson's Disease</h2>
<p class="First">The effectiveness of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets in the treatment of Parkinson's disease was evaluated in a multinational drug development program consisting of seven randomized, controlled trials. Three were conducted in patients with early Parkinson's disease who were not receiving concomitant levodopa, and four were conducted in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who were receiving concomitant levodopa. Among these seven studies, three studies provide the most persuasive evidence of pramipexole's effectiveness in the management of patients with Parkinson's disease who were and were not receiving concomitant levodopa. Two of these three trials enrolled patients with early Parkinson's disease (not receiving levodopa), and one enrolled patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who were receiving maximally tolerated doses of levodopa.  </p>
<p>In all studies, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), or one or more of its subparts, served as the primary outcome assessment measure. The UPDRS is a four-part multi-item rating scale intended to evaluate mentation (part I), Activities of Daily Living (ADL) (part II), motor performance (part III), and complications of therapy (part IV). </p>
<p>Part II of the UPDRS contains 13 questions relating to ADL, which are scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (maximal severity) for a maximum (worst) score of 52. Part III of the UPDRS contains 27 questions (for 14 items) and is scored as described for part II. It is designed to assess the severity of the cardinal motor findings in patients with Parkinson's disease (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4050941" conceptname="Muscle rigidity">rigidity</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4161417" conceptname="Bradykinesia">bradykinesia</span>, postural instability, etc.), scored for different body regions, and has a maximum (worst) score of 108.</p>

<h2>Studies in Patients with Early Parkinson's Disease</h2>
<p class="First">Patients (N=599) in the two studies of early Parkinson's disease had a mean disease duration of 2 years, limited or no prior exposure to levodopa (generally none in the preceding 6 months), and were not experiencing the "on-off" phenomenon and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047115" conceptname="Oral dyskinesia">dyskinesia</span> characteristic of later stages of the disease. </p>
<p>One of the two early Parkinson's disease studies (N=335) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trial consisting of a 7 week dose escalation period and a 6 month maintenance period. Patients could be on selegiline, anticholinergics, or both, but could not be on levodopa products or amantadine. Patients were randomized to pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets or placebo. Patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets had a starting daily dose of 0.375 mg and were titrated to a maximally tolerated dose, but no higher than 4.5 mg/day in three divided doses. At the end of the 6 month maintenance period, the mean improvement from baseline on the UPDRS part II (ADL) total score was 1.9 in the group receiving pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and -0.4 in the placebo group, a difference that was statistically significant. The mean improvement from baseline on the UPDRS part III total score was 5.0 in the group receiving pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and -0.8 in the placebo group, a difference that was also statistically significant. A statistically significant difference between groups in favor of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets was seen beginning at week 2 of the UPDRS part II (maximum dose 0.75 mg/day) and at week 3 of the UPDRS part III (maximum dose 1.5 mg/day). </p>
<p>The second early Parkinson's disease study (N=264) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trial consisting of a 6 week dose-escalation period and a 4 week maintenance period. Patients could be on selegiline, anticholinergics, amantadine, or any combination of these, but could not be on levodopa products. Patients were randomized to 1 of 4 fixed doses of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets (1.5 mg, 3 mg, 4.5 mg, or 6 mg per day) or placebo. At the end of the 4-week maintenance period, the mean improvement from baseline on the UPDRS part II total score was 1.8 in the patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, regardless of assigned dose group, and 0.3 in placebo-treated patients. The mean improvement from baseline on the UPDRS part III total score was 4.2 in patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and 0.6 in placebo treated patients. No dose-response relationship was demonstrated. The between treatment differences on both parts of the UPDRS were statistically significant in favor of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets for all doses.  </p>
<p>No differences in effectiveness based on age or gender were detected. There were too few non- caucasian patients to evaluate the effect of race. Patients receiving selegiline or anticholinergics had responses similar to patients not receiving these drugs.</p>

<h2>Studies in Patients with Advanced Parkinson's Disease</h2>
<p class="First">In the advanced Parkinson's disease study, the primary assessments were the UPDRS and daily diaries that quantified amounts of "on" and "off" time.  </p>
<p>Patients in the advanced Parkinson's disease study (N=360) had a mean disease duration of 9 years, had been exposed to levodopa for long periods of time (mean 8 years), used concomitant levodopa during the trial, and had "on-off" periods. </p>
<p>The advanced Parkinson's disease study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trial consisting of a 7 week dose-escalation period and a 6 month maintenance period. Patients were all treated with concomitant levodopa products and could additionally be on concomitant selegiline, anticholinergics, amantadine, or any combination. Patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets had a starting dose of 0.375 mg/day and were titrated to a maximally tolerated dose, but no higher than 4.5 mg/day in three divided doses. At selected times during the 6 month maintenance period, patients were asked to record the amount of "off," "on," or "on with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047115" conceptname="Oral dyskinesia">dyskinesia</span>" time per day for several sequential days. At the end of the 6 month maintenance period, the mean improvement from baseline on the UPDRS part II total score was 2.7 in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and 0.5 in the placebo group, a difference that was statistically significant. The mean improvement from baseline on the UPDRS part III total score was 5.6 in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and 2.8 in the placebo group, a difference that was statistically significant. A statistically significant difference between groups in favor of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets was seen at week 3 of the UPDRS part II (maximum dose 1.5 mg/day) and at week 2 of the UPDRS part III (maximum dose 0.75 mg/day). Dosage reduction of levodopa was allowed during this study if <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047115" conceptname="Oral dyskinesia">dyskinesia</span> (or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span>) developed; levodopa dosage reduction occurred in 76% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets versus 54% of placebo patients. On average, the levodopa dose was reduced 27%.  </p>
<p>The mean number of "off" hours per day during baseline was 6 hours for both treatment groups. Throughout the trial, patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride had a mean of 4 "off" hours per day, while placebo-treated patients continued to experience 6 "off" hours per day. </p>
<p>No differences in effectiveness based on age or gender were detected. There were too few non-caucasian patients to evaluate the effect of race.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">Before initiating treatment with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, patients should be advised of the potential to develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> and specifically asked about factors that may increase the risk with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets such as concomitant sedating medications, the presence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435524" conceptname="Sleep disorder">sleep disorders</span>, and concomitant medications that increase pramipexole plasma levels (e.g., cimetidine - see PRECAUTIONS, <a href="#i4i_drug_interaction_id_fb48b0d2-6242-429b-8d8d-63ee32522db2">Drug Interactions</a>).

<h2> Symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span></h2>
<p class="First">Dopamine agonists, in clinical studies and clinical experience, appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, with resulting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span>, especially during dose escalation. Parkinson's disease patients, in addition, appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to an orthostatic challenge. For these reasons, both Parkinson's disease patients being treated with dopaminergic agonists ordinarily require careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span>, especially during dose escalation, and should be informed of this risk (see PRECAUTIONS, <a href="#i4i_info_patients_id_9548ddd6-0430-4ad1-974f-78a6349c6c60">Information for Patients (also see Patient Package Insert)</a>). </p>
<p>In clinical trials of pramipexole, however, and despite clear orthostatic effects in normal volunteers, the reported incidence of clinically significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span> was not greater among those assigned to pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets than among those assigned to placebo. This result, especially with the higher doses used in Parkinson’s disease, is clearly unexpected in light of the previous experience with the risks of dopamine agonist therapy. </p>
<p>While this finding could reflect a unique property of pramipexole, it might also be explained by the conditions of the study and the nature of the population enrolled in the clinical trials. Patients were very carefully titrated, and patients with active cardiovascular disease or significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span> at baseline were excluded.</p>

<p class="First">In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in early Parkinson's disease, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span> were observed in 9% (35 of 388) of patients receiving pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, compared with 2.6% (6 of 235) of patients receiving placebo. In the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in advanced Parkinson's disease, where patients received pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span> were observed in 16.5% (43 of 260) of patients receiving pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets compared with 3.8% (10 of 264) of patients receiving placebo. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">Hallucinations</span> were of sufficient severity to cause discontinuation of treatment in 3.1% of the early Parkinson's disease patients and 2.7% of the advanced Parkinson's disease patients compared with about 0.4% of placebo patients in both populations.  </p>
<p>Age appears to increase the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span> attributable to pramipexole. In the early Parkinson's disease patients, the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span> was 1.9 times greater than placebo in patients younger than 65 years and 6.8 times greater than placebo in patients older than 65 years.

<h2>Retinal Pathology in Albino Rats</h2>
<p class="First">Pathologic changes (degeneration and loss of photoreceptor cells) were observed in the retina of albino rats in the 2 year carcinogenicity study. While <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090255" conceptname="Retinal drusen">retinal degeneration</span> was not diagnosed in pigmented rats treated for 2 years, a thinning in the outer nuclear layer of the retina was slightly greater in rats given drug compared with controls.

<h2>Events Reported with Dopaminergic Therapy</h2>
<p class="First">Although the events enumerated below may not have been reported in association with the use of pramipexole in its development program, they are associated with the use of other dopaminergic drugs. The expected incidence of these events, however, is so low that even if pramipexole caused these events at rates similar to those attributable to other dopaminergic therapies, it would be unlikely that even a single case would have occurred in a cohort of the size exposed to pramipexole in studies to date.</p>

<h2>Melanoma</h2>
<p class="First">Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson’s disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson’s disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson’s disease, is unclear.</p>
<p>For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets for <span class="Italics">any</span> indication. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists).</p>

<h2>Information for Patients (also see Patient Package Insert)</h2>
<p class="First">Patients should be instructed to take pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets only as prescribed. </p>
<p>Patients should be alerted to the potential sedating effects associated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> and the possibility of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falling</span> asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. Since <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> is a frequent adverse event with potentially serious consequences, patients should neither drive a car nor engage in other potentially dangerous activities until they have gained sufficient experience with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets to gauge whether or not it affects their mental and/or motor performance adversely. Patients should be advised that if increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> or new episodes of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falling</span> asleep during activities of daily living (e.g., watching television, passenger in a car, etc.) are experienced at any time during treatment, they should not drive or participate in potentially dangerous activities until they have contacted their physician. Because of possible additive effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking other sedating medications or alcohol in combination with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and when taking concomitant medications that increase plasma levels of pramipexole (e.g., cimetidine).  </p>
<p>Patients should be informed that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span> can occur and that the elderly are at a higher risk than younger patients with Parkinson's disease. </p>
<p>There have been reports of patients experiencing intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, and other intense urges  and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications that increase central dopaminergic tone, that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, including pramipexole dihydrochloride. Although it is not proven that the medications caused these events, these urges were reported to have stopped in some cases when the dose was reduced or the medication was stopped. Prescribers should ask patients about the development of new or increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4023166" conceptname="Gambling">gambling</span> urges, sexual urges or other urges while being treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride. Patients should inform their physician if they experience new or increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4023166" conceptname="Gambling">gambling</span> urges, increased sexual urges or other intense urges while taking pramipexole dihydrochloride. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking pramipexole dihydrochloride. </p>
<p>Patients may develop postural (orthostatic) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, with or without symptoms such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">fainting</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372448" conceptname="Loss of consciousness">blackouts</span>, and sometimes, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> may occur more frequently during initial therapy. Accordingly, patients should be cautioned against rising rapidly after sitting or lying down, especially if they have been doing so for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4088438" conceptname="Prolonged periods">prolonged periods</span> and especially at the initiation of treatment with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets.  </p>
<p>Because the teratogenic potential of pramipexole has not been completely established in laboratory animals, and because experience in humans is limited, patients should be advised to notify their physicians if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy (see PRECAUTIONS, <a href="#i4i_pregnancy_id_a1824eec-3e32-49e6-bc38-425de71a089a">Pregnancy</a>). </p>
<p>Because of the possibility that pramipexole may be excreted in breast milk, patients should be advised to notify their physicians if they intend to breast-feed or are breast-feeding an infant.  </p>
<p>If patients develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, they should be advised that taking pramipexole with food may reduce the occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>.</p>

<h2>Other Drugs Eliminated Via Renal Secretion</h2>
<p class="First">Population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that coadministration of drugs that are secreted by the cationic transport system (e.g., cimetidine, ranitidine, diltiazem, triamterene, verapamil, quinidine, and quinine) decreases the oral clearance of pramipexole by about 20%, while those secreted by the anionic transport system (e.g., cephalosporins, penicillins, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, and chlorpropamide) are likely to have little effect on the oral clearance of pramipexole.</p>

<h2>CYP Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes would not be expected to affect pramipexole elimination because pramipexole is not appreciably metabolized by these enzymes <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> or <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>. Pramipexole does not inhibit CYP enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Inhibition of CYP2D6 was observed with an apparent Ki of 30 µM, indicating that pramipexole will not inhibit CYP enzymes at plasma concentrations observed following the clinical dose of 4.5 mg/day (1.5 mg TID).</p>

<h2>Dopamine Antagonists</h2>
<p class="First">Since pramipexole is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that dopamine antagonists, such as the neuroleptics (phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide, may diminish the effectiveness of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets.</p>

Pramipexole was administered in the diet to Wistar rats at 0.3, 2, and 8 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs were 0.3, 2.5, and 12.5 times the AUC in humans at the MRHD). No significant increases in tumors occurred in either species.  </p>
<p>Pramipexole was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of assays, including the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> Ames assay, V79 gene mutation assay for HGPRT mutants, chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus assay.</p>
<p>In rat fertility studies, pramipexole at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day (5 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis), prolonged estrus cycles and inhibited implantation. These effects were associated with reductions in serum levels of prolactin, a hormone necessary for implantation and maintenance of early pregnancy in rats.</p>

<h3>Pregnancy Category C</h3>
<p class="First">When pramipexole was given to female rats throughout pregnancy, implantation was inhibited at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day (5 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis). Administration of 1.5 mg/kg/day of pramipexole to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis (gestation days 7 through 16) resulted in a high incidence of total resorption of embryos.  The plasma AUC in rats at this dose was 4 times the AUC in humans at the MRHD.  These findings are thought to be due to the prolactin lowering effect of pramipexole, since prolactin is necessary for implantation and maintenance of early pregnancy in rats (but not rabbits or humans). Because of pregnancy disruption and early embryonic loss in these studies, the teratogenic potential of pramipexole could not be adequately evaluated. There was no evidence of adverse effects on embryo fetal development following administration of up to 10 mg/kg/day to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis (plasma AUC was 71 times that in humans at the MRHD). Postnatal growth was inhibited in the offspring of rats treated with 0.5 mg/kg/day (approximately equivalent to the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) or greater during the latter part of pregnancy and throughout lactation.</p>
<p>There are no studies of pramipexole in human pregnancy. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, pramipexole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">A single-dose, radio-labeled study showed that drug-related materials were excreted into the breast milk of lactating rats. Concentrations of radioactivity in milk were three to six times higher than concentrations in plasma at equivalent time points.</p>
<p>Other studies have shown that pramipexole treatment resulted in an inhibition of prolactin secretion in humans and rats. </p>
<p>It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from pramipexole, a decision should be made as to whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Pramipexole total oral clearance was approximately 30% lower in subjects older than 65 years compared with younger subjects, because of a decline in pramipexole renal clearance due to an age-related reduction in renal function. This resulted in an increase in elimination half-life from approximately 8.5 hours to 12 hours. In clinical studies with Parkinson’s disease patients, 38.7% of patients were older than 65 years. There were no apparent differences in efficacy or safety between older and younger patients, except that the relative risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucination</span> associated with the use of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets was increased in the elderly. </p>

<h2>Parkinson's Disease</h2>
<p class="First">During the premarketing development of pramipexole, patients with either early or advanced Parkinson's disease were enrolled in clinical trials. Apart from the severity and duration of their disease, the two populations differed in their use of concomitant levodopa therapy. Patients with early disease did not receive concomitant levodopa therapy during treatment with pramipexole; those with advanced Parkinson's disease all received concomitant levodopa treatment. Because these two populations may have differential risks for various adverse events, this section will, in general, present adverse event data for these two populations separately.  </p>
<p>Because the controlled trials performed during premarketing development all used a titration design, with a resultant confounding of time and dose, it was impossible to adequately evaluate the effects of dose on the incidence of adverse events.</p>

<h2>Early Parkinson's Disease</h2>
<p class="First">In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with early Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (&gt;5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">constipation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">asthenia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span>.</p>
<p>Approximately 12% of 388 patients with early Parkinson's disease and treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 11% of 235 patients who received placebo. The adverse events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span> [3.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0.4% on placebo]; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span> [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 1% on placebo]; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0% on placebo]; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373747" conceptname="Extrapyramidal disease">extrapyramidal syndrome</span> [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 6.4% on placebo]; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> [1.3% and 1.0%, respectively, on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0% on placebo]); and gastrointestinal system (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0.4% on placebo]).</p>

<h3>Adverse-Event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Early Parkinson's Disease</h3>
<p class="First">Table 1 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in early Parkinson's disease that were reported by ≥1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, patients did not receive concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity.</p>
<p>The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-event incidence rate in the population studied.</p>

<h2>Advanced Parkinson's Disease</h2>

<h3>Adverse-event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Advanced Parkinson's Disease</h3>
<p class="First">Table 2 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in advanced Parkinson's disease that were reported by ≥1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets or placebo was administered to patients who were also receiving concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. </p>
<p>The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-events incidence rate in the population studied.</p>

<h3>Adverse Events; Relationship to Age, Gender, and Race</h3>
<p class="First">Among the treatment-emergent adverse events in patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucination</span> appeared to exhibit a positive relationship to age in patients with Parkinson’s disease. Although no gender-related differences were observed in Parkinson’s disease patients. Less than 4% of patients enrolled were noncaucasian, therefore, an evaluation of adverse events related to race is not possible.</p>

<h3>Other Adverse Events Observed During All Phase 2 and 3 Clinical Trials</h3>
<p class="First">Pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets have been administered to 1,620 Parkinson’s disease patients in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing; similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using MedDRA dictionary terminology.  These categories are used in the listing below. Adverse events which are not listed above but occurred on at least two occasions (one occasion if the event was serious) in the 2,509 individuals exposed to pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets are listed below.  The reported events below are included without regard to determination of a causal relationship to pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets.</p>

<h2>Post-Marketing Experience  </h2>
<p class="First">In addition to the adverse events reported during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, primarily in Parkinson’s disease patients. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.  Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to pramipexole tablets. Similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using the MedDRA dictionary: abnormal behavior, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4304251" conceptname="Bizarre dreams">abnormal dreams</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440279" conceptname="Accident">accidents</span> (including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span>), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372448" conceptname="Loss of consciousness">blackouts</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span> (all kinds), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> (including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span>), increased eating (including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4086349" conceptname="Binging">binge eating</span>, compulsive eating, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438872" conceptname="Excessive eating - polyphagia">hyperphagia</span>), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4186941" conceptname="Sexual desire disorder">libido disorders</span> (including increased and decreased libido, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4032473" conceptname="Nymphomania">hypersexuality</span>), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436959" conceptname="Compulsive gambling">pathological gambling</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">syncope</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight increase</span>.</p>

One patient, with a 10 year history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span>, took 11 mg/day of pramipexole for 2 days in a clinical trial to evaluate the effect of pramipexole in schizophrenic patients.

Blood pressure remained stable although <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="444070" conceptname="Tachycardia">pulse rate increased</span> to between 100 and 120 beats/minute. The patient withdrew from the study at the end of week 2 due to lack of efficacy.</p>
<p>There is no known antidote for overdosage of a dopamine agonist. If signs of central nervous system stimulation are present, a phenothiazine or other butyrophenone neuroleptic agent may be indicated; the efficacy of such drugs in reversing the effects of overdosage has not been assessed. Management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> may require general supportive measures along with gastric lavage, intravenous fluids, and electrocardiogram monitoring.</p>

<h3>Maintenance Treatment  </h3>
<p class="First">Pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets were effective and well tolerated over a dosage range of 1.5 to 4.5 mg/day administered in equally divided doses three times per day with or without concomitant levodopa (approximately 800 mg/day). </p>
<p>In a fixed-dose study in early Parkinson's disease patients, doses of 3 mg, 4.5 mg, and 6 mg per day of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets were not shown to provide any significant benefit beyond that achieved at a daily dose of 1.5 mg/day. However, in the same fixed-dose study, the following adverse events were dose related: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">constipation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439147" conceptname="Amnesia">amnesia</span>. The frequency of these events was generally 2-fold greater than placebo for pramipexole doses greater than 3 mg/day. The incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> reported with pramipexole at a dose of 1.5 mg/day was comparable to placebo. </p>
<p>When pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets are used in combination with levodopa, a reduction of the levodopa dosage should be considered. In a controlled study in advanced Parkinson's disease, the dosage of levodopa was reduced by an average of 27% from baseline.</p>

<h2>Retinal Pathology in Albino Rats</h2>
<p class="First">Pathologic changes (degeneration and loss of photoreceptor cells) were observed in the retina of albino rats in the 2 year carcinogenicity study with pramipexole. These findings were first observed during week 76 and were dose dependent in animals receiving 2 or 8 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs equal to 2.5 and 12.5 times the AUC in humans that received 1.5 mg tid).  In a similar study of pigmented rats with 2 years exposure to pramipexole at 2 or 8 mg/kg/day, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090255" conceptname="Retinal drusen">retinal degeneration</span> was not diagnosed. Animals given drug had thinning in the outer nuclear layer of the retina that was only slightly greater than that seen in control rats utilizing morphometry. </p>
<p>Investigative studies demonstrated that pramipexole reduced the rate of disk shedding from the photoreceptor rod cells of the retina in albino rats, which was associated with enhanced sensitivity to the damaging effects of light. In a comparative study, degeneration and loss of photoreceptor cells occurred in albino rats after 13 weeks of treatment with 25 mg/kg/day of pramipexole (54 times the highest clinical dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis) and constant light (100 lux) but not in pigmented rats exposed to the same dose and higher light intensities (500 lux). Thus, the retina of albino rats is considered to be uniquely sensitive to the damaging effects of pramipexole and light. Similar changes in the retina did not occur in a 2 year carcinogenicity study in albino mice treated with 0.3, 2, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.3, 2.2 and 11 times the highest clinical dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis). Evaluation of the retinas of monkeys given 0.1, 0.5, or 2 mg/kg/day of pramipexole (0.4, 2.2, and 8.6 times the highest clinical dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis) for 12 months and minipigs given 0.3, 1, or 5 mg/kg/day of pramipexole for 13 weeks also detected no changes. </p>
<p>The potential significance of this effect in humans has not been established, but cannot be disregarded because disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (ie, disk shedding) may be involved.</p>

<h2>Fibro-osseous Proliferative Lesions in Mice</h2>
<p class="First">An increased incidence of fibro-osseous proliferative lesions occurred in the femurs of female mice treated for 2 years with 0.3, 2, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.3, 2.2, and 11 times the highest clinical dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis). Lesions occurred at a lower rate in control animals. Similar lesions were not observed in male mice or rats and monkeys of either sex that were treated chronically with pramipexole. The significance of this lesion to humans is not known.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">Other Information about pramipexole </span></p>
<p>Studies of people with Parkinson’s disease show that they may be at an increased risk of developing melanoma, a form of skin cancer, when compared to people without Parkinson’s disease. It is not known if this problem is associated with Parkinson’s disease or the medicines used to treat Parkinson’s disease. Pramipexole is one of the medicines used to treat Parkinson’s disease, therefore, patients being treated with pramipexole should have periodic skin examinations. </p>
<p>There have been reports of patients taking certain medicines to treat Parkinson’s disease, including pramipexole, that have reported problems with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4023166" conceptname="Gambling">gambling</span>, compulsive eating, and increased sex drive. It is not possible to reliably estimate how often these behaviors occur or to determine which factors may contribute to them. If you or your family members notice that you are developing unusual behaviors, talk to your doctor.</p>
