<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">NICOTROL<span class="Sup">®</span> Inhaler (nicotine inhalation system) consists of a mouthpiece and a plastic cartridge delivering 4 mg of nicotine from a porous plug containing 10 mg nicotine. The cartridge is inserted into the mouthpiece prior to use. Nicotine is a tertiary amine composed of a pyridine and a pyrrolidine ring. It is a colorless to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260836" conceptname="Blanching of skin">pale</span> yellow, freely water-soluble, strongly alkaline, oily, volatile, hygroscopic liquid obtained from the tobacco plant. Nicotine has a characteristic pungent odor and turns brown on exposure to air or light. Of its two stereoisomers, S(-)nicotine is the more active. It is the prevalent form in tobacco, and is the form in the NICOTROL Inhaler. The free alkaloid is absorbed rapidly through skin, mucous membranes, and the respiratory tract.</p>
<p>Chemical Name: S-3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl) pyridine</p>

<a name="section-2.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Pharmacologic Action</h2>
<p class="First">Nicotine, the chief alkaloid in tobacco products, binds stereo-selectively to nicotinic-cholinergic receptors at the autonomic ganglia, in the adrenal medulla, at neuromuscular junctions, and in the brain. Two types of central nervous system effects are believed to be the basis of nicotine's positively reinforcing properties. A stimulating effect is exerted mainly in the cortex via the locus ceruleus and a reward effect is exerted in the limbic system. At low doses the stimulant effects predominate while at high doses the reward effects predominate. Intermittent intravenous administration of nicotine activates neurohormonal pathways, releasing acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, vasopressin, beta-endorphin, growth hormone, and ACTH.</p>

<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">The cardiovascular effects of nicotine include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137788" conceptname="Vascular constriction">peripheral vasoconstriction</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, and elevated blood pressure. Acute and chronic tolerance to nicotine develops from smoking tobacco or ingesting nicotine preparations. Acute tolerance (a reduction in response for a given dose) develops rapidly (less than 1 hour), but not at the same rate for different physiologic effects (skin temperature, heart rate, subjective effects). Withdrawal symptoms such as cigarette craving can be reduced in most individuals by plasma nicotine levels lower than those from smoking.</p>

<p>Both smoking and nicotine can increase circulating cortisol and catecholamines, and tolerance does not develop to the catecholaminereleasing effects of nicotine. Changes in the response to a concomitantly administered adrenergic agonist or antagonist should be watched for when nicotine intake is altered during NICOTROL Inhaler therapy and/or smoking cessation (See <a href="#precautions_drug_interactions">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</a>).</p>

<h2>Absorption</h2>
<p class="First">Most of the nicotine released from the NICOTROL Inhaler is deposited in the mouth. Only a fraction of the dose released, less than 5%, reaches the lower respiratory tract. An intensive inhalation regimen (80 deep inhalations over 20 minutes) releases on the average 4 mg of the nicotine content of each cartridge of which about 2 mg is systemically absorbed. Peak plasma concentrations are typically reached within 15 minutes of the end of inhalation.</p>
<p>Absorption of nicotine through the buccal mucosa is relatively slow and the high and rapid rise followed by the decline in nicotine arterial plasma concentrations seen with cigarette smoking are not achieved with the inhaler. After use of the single inhaler the arterial nicotine concentrations rise slowly to an average of 6 ng/mL in contrast to those of a cigarette, which increase rapidly and reach a mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> of approximately 49 ng/mL within 5 minutes.</p>
<p>The temperature dependency of nicotine release from the NICOTROL Inhaler was studied between 68°F and 104°F in eighteen patients. Average achievable steady state plasma levels after 20 minutes of an intensive inhalation regimen each hour at ambient room temperature are on the order of 23 ng/mL. The corresponding nicotine plasma levels achievable at 86°F and 104°F are on the order of 30 and 34 ng/mL. Nicotine peak plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) at steady-state, after 20 minutes of an intensive inhalation regimen per hour, for 10 hours.</p>

<p>Ad libitum use of the NICOTROL Inhaler typically produces nicotine plasma levels of 6–8 ng/mL, corresponding to about 1/3 of those achieved with cigarette smoking.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-3.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p class="First">The volume of distribution following IV administration of nicotine is approximately 2 to 3 L/kg. Plasma protein binding of nicotine is &lt;5%. Therefore, changes in nicotine binding from use of concomitant drugs or alterations of plasma proteins by disease states would not be expected to have significant effects on nicotine kinetics.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-3.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Metabolism</h2>
<p class="First">More than 20 metabolites of nicotine have been identified, all of which are less active than the parent compound. The primary urinary metabolites are cotinine (15% of the dose) and trans-3-hydroxycotinine (45% of the dose). Cotinine has a half-life of 15 to 20 hours and concentrations that exceed nicotine by 10-fold. The major site for the metabolism of nicotine is the liver. The kidney and lung are also sites of nicotine metabolism.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-3.4"></a><p></p>
<h2>Elimination</h2>
<p class="First">About 10% of the nicotine absorbed is excreted unchanged in the urine. This may be increased to up to 30% with high urine flow rates and urinary acidification below pH 5. The average plasma clearance is about 1.2 L/min in a healthy adult smoker. The apparent elimination half-life of nicotine is 1 to 2 hours.</p>

<h2>Gender Differences</h2>
<p class="First">Intersubject variability coefficients of variation (C.V.) for the pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span>) were approximately 40% and 30% respectively, for males and females. There were no medically significant differences between females and males in the kinetics of NICOTROL Inhaler.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL TRIALS</h1>
<p class="First">The efficacy of NICOTROL Inhaler therapy as an aid to smoking cessation was demonstrated in two single-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials with a total of 445 healthy patients. The number of NICOTROL Inhaler cartridges used was a minimum dose of 4 cartridges/day and a maximum dose of 20 cartridges/day. In both studies, the recommended duration of treatment was 3 months; however, the patients were permitted to continue to use the product for up to 6 months, if they wished. The quit rates are the percentage of all persons initially enrolled who continuously abstained after week 2. NICOTROL Inhaler was more effective than placebo at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months. The efficacy is shown in the following table.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First">Nicotine from any source can be toxic and addictive. Smoking causes <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="257907" conceptname="Disorder of lung">lung disease</span>, cancer and heart disease, and may adversely affect pregnant women or the fetus. For any smoker, with or without concomitant disease or pregnancy, the risk of nicotine replacement in a smoking cessation program should be weighed against the hazard of continued smoking, and the likelihood of achieving <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4310250" conceptname="Ex-smoker">cessation of smoking</span> without nicotine replacement.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">

The NICOTROL Inhaler does not deliver hydrogen cyanide and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4198996" conceptname="Carbon monoxide">carbon monoxide</span>. However, nicotine has been shown in animal studies to cause fetal harm. It is therefore presumed that NICOTROL Inhaler can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. The effect of nicotine delivery by NICOTROL Inhaler has not been examined in pregnancy (See <a href="#precautions">PRECAUTIONS</a>). Therefore, pregnant smokers should be encouraged to attempt cessation using educational and behavioral interventions before using pharmacological approaches. If NICOTROL Inhaler is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while using it, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.</p>

<a name="section-8.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">The patient should be urged to stop smoking completely when initiating NICOTROL Inhaler therapy (See <a href="#dosage_administration">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>). Patients should be informed that if they continue to smoke while using the product, they may experience adverse effects due to peak nicotine levels higher than those experienced from smoking alone. If there is a clinically significant increase in cardiovascular or other effects attributable to nicotine, the treatment should be discontinued (See <a href="#warnings">WARNINGS</a>). Physicians should anticipate that concomitant medications may need dosage adjustment (See <a href="#precautions_drug_interactions">Drug Interactions</a>). Sustained use (beyond 6 months) of NICOTROL Inhaler by patients who stop smoking has not been studied and is not recommended.

<h2>Information for Patient</h2>
<p class="First">A patient information sheet is included in the package of NICOTROL Inhaler cartridges dispensed to the patient. Patients should be encouraged to read the information sheet carefully and to ask their physician and pharmacist about the proper use of the product (See <a href="#dosage_administration">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Physiological changes resulting from smoking cessation, with or without nicotine replacement, may alter the pharmacokinetics of certain concomitant medications, such as tricyclic antidepressants and theophylline. Doses of these and perhaps other medications may need to be adjusted in patients who successfully quit smoking.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Nicotine itself does not appear to be a carcinogen in laboratory animals. However, nicotine and its metabolites increased the incidences of tumors in the cheek pouches of hamsters and forestomach of F344 rats, respectively when given in combination with tumor-initiators. One study, which could not be replicated, suggested that cotinine, the primary metabolite of nicotine, may cause lymphoreticular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084784" conceptname="Sarcoma">sarcoma</span> in the large intestine of rats. Neither nicotine nor cotinine was mutagenic in the Ames <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">salmonella</span> test. Nicotine induced reparable DNA damage in an <span class="Italics">E. coli</span> test system. Nicotine was shown to be genotoxic in a test system using Chinese hamster ovary cells. In rats and rabbits, implantation can be delayed or inhibited by a reduction in DNA synthesis that appears to be caused by nicotine. Studies have shown a decrease in litter size in rats treated with nicotine during gestation.</p>

<h2>Use in Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Caution should be exercised when the NICOTROL Inhaler is administered to nursing mothers. The safety of NICOTROL Inhaler therapy in nursing infants has not been examined. Nicotine passes freely into breast milk; the milk to plasma ratio averages 2.9. Nicotine is absorbed orally. An infant has the ability to clear nicotine by hepatic first-pass clearance; however, the efficiency of removal is probably lowest at birth. Nicotine concentrations in milk can be expected to be lower with NICOTROL Inhaler when used as recommended than with cigarette smoking, as maternal plasma nicotine concentrations are generally reduced with nicotine replacement. The risk of exposure of the infant to nicotine from NICOTROL Inhaler therapy should be weighed against the risks associated with the infant's exposure to nicotine from continued smoking by the mother (passive smoke exposure and contamination of breast milk with other components of tobacco smoke) and from the NICOTROL Inhaler alone, or in combination with continued smoking.</p>

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric and adolescent patients below the age of 18 years have not been established for any nicotine replacement product. However, no specific medical risk is known or expected in nicotine dependent adolescents. NICOTROL Inhaler should be used for the treatment of tobacco <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> in the older adolescent only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of NICOTROL Inhaler did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reports on clinical experience have not identified differences between older and younger patients. In general, dosage selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosage range reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Assessment of adverse events in the 1,439 patients (730 on active drug) who participated in controlled clinical trials (including three dose finding studies) is complicated by the occurrence of signs and symptoms of nicotine withdrawal in some patients and nicotine excess in others. The incidence of adverse events is confounded by: (1) the many minor complaints that smokers commonly have, (2) continued smoking by many patients and (3) the local irritation from both the active drug and the placebo.</p>

<h2>Local Irritation</h2>
<p class="First">NICOTROL Inhaler and the placebo were both associated with local irritant side effects. Local irritation in mouth and throat was reported by 40% of patients on active drug as compared to 18% of patients on placebo. Irritant effects were higher in the two pivotal trials with higher doses being 66% on active drug and 42% on placebo. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">Coughing</span> (32% active versus 12% placebo) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4320791" conceptname="Rhinitis">rhinitis</span> (23% active versus 16% placebo) were also higher on active drug.

<h1>DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></h1>
<p class="First">NICOTROL Inhaler is likely to have a low abuse potential based on differences between the product and cigarettes in three characteristics commonly considered important in contributing to abuse: slower absorption, smaller fluctuations in blood levels and lower blood levels of nicotine. NICOTROL Inhaler, like many other nicotine-based smoking cessation therapies, does not produce arterial concentrations similar to cigarettes. However, nicotine withdrawal symptoms were noted in clinical trials at the time of NICOTROL Inhaler tapering and after NICOTROL Inhaler discontinuation.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">Dependence</span> might occur from transference of tobacco-related nicotine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> to the NICOTROL Inhaler. The use of the inhaler beyond 6 months has not been evaluated in clinical trials and is not recommended. To minimize the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>, patients should be encouraged to withdraw gradually from NICOTROL Inhaler therapy after 3 months of usage (See <a href="#dosage_administration">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>). If necessary, dose reduction can be achieved by gradual reduction of the dose over a 6 to 12 week period.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Patients must desire to stop smoking and should be instructed to <span class="Italics">stop smoking completely</span> as they begin using NICOTROL Inhaler. It is important that patients understand the instructions, and have their questions answered. They should clearly understand the directions for using the NICOTROL Inhaler and safely disposing of the used cartridges.</p>
<p>The initial dosage of NICOTROL Inhaler is individualized. Patients may selftitrate to the level of nicotine they require. Most successful patients in the clinical trials used between 6 and 16 cartridges a day. Best effect was achieved by frequent continuous puffing (20 minutes). The recommended duration of treatment is 3 months, after which patients may be weaned from the NICOTROL Inhaler by gradual reduction of the daily dose over the following 6 to 12 weeks. The safety and efficacy of the continued use of NICOTROL Inhaler for periods longer than 6 months have not been studied and such use is not recommended.</p>

<h3>Gradual Reduction of Dose (Up to 12 Weeks)</h3>
<p class="First">Most patients will need to gradually discontinue the use of NICOTROL Inhaler after the initial treatment period. Gradual reduction of dose may begin after twelve weeks of initial treatment and may last for up to twelve weeks. Recommended strategies for discontinuing use include suggesting to patients that they use the product less frequently, keep a tally of daily usage, try to meet a steadily reducing target or set a planned quit date for stopping use of the product.</p>

<h2>Individualization of Dosage</h2>
<p class="First">The NICOTROL Inhaler provides the smoker with adequate amounts of nicotine to reduce the urge to smoke, and may provide some degree of comfort by providing a hand-to-mouth ritual similar to smoking, although the importance of such an effect in smoking cessation is, as yet, unknown.</p>
<p>The success or failure of smoking cessation is influenced by the quality, intensity and frequency of supportive care. Patients are more likely to quit smoking if they are seen frequently and participate in formal smoking cessation programs.</p>
<p>The goal of NICOTROL Inhaler therapy is complete abstinence. If a patient is unable to stop smoking by the fourth week of therapy, treatment should probably be discontinued.</p>
<p>Patients who fail to quit on any attempt may benefit from interventions to improve their chances for success on subsequent attempts. Patients who were unsuccessful should be counseled and should then probably be given a therapeutic holiday before the next attempt. A new quit attempt should be encouraged when conditions are more favorable.</p>
<p>Based on the clinical trials, a reasonable approach to assisting patients in their attempt to quit smoking is to begin initial treatment, using the recommended dosage (See <a href="#dosage_administration">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>). Dosage can then be adjusted in those patients with signs or symptoms of nicotine withdrawal or excess. Patients who are successfully abstinent on NICOTROL Inhaler should be treated at the selected dosage for up to 12 weeks, after which use of the Inhaler should be gradually reduced over the next 6 to 12 weeks. Some patients may not require gradual reduction of dosage and may abruptly stop treatment successfully. The safe use of this product for longer than 6 months has not been established.</p>
<p>The symptoms of nicotine withdrawal overlap those of nicotine excess (See <a href="#pharmacodynamics">Pharmacodynamics</a> and <a href="#adverse_reactions">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a> sections). Since patients using NICOTROL Inhaler may also smoke intermittently, it is sometimes difficult to determine if they are experiencing nicotine withdrawal or nicotine excess. Controlled clinical trials of nicotine products suggest that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315078" conceptname="Palpitations">palpitations</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span> are more often symptoms of nicotine excess, whereas <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436817" conceptname="Feeling nervous">nervousness</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span> are more often symptoms of nicotine withdrawal.</p>
