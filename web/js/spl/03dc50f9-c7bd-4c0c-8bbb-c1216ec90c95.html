<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Busulfan is a bifunctional alkylating agent known chemically as 1,4- butanediol, dimethanesulfonate. BUSULFEX<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (busulfan) Injection is intended for intravenous administration. It is supplied as a clear, colorless, sterile, solution in 10 mL single use vials.</p>
<p>Each vial of BUSULFEX contains 60 mg (6 mg/mL) of busulfan, the active ingredient, a white crystalline powder with a molecular formula of CH<span class="Sub">3</span>SO<span class="Sub">2</span>O(CH<span class="Sub">2</span>)<span class="Sub">4</span>OSO<span class="Sub">2</span>CH<span class="Sub">3</span> and a molecular weight of 246 g/mole. Busulfan is dissolved in N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) 33% vol/vol and Polyethylene Glycol 400, 67% vol/vol. The solubility of busulfan in water is 0.1 g/L and the pH of BUSULFEX diluted to approximately 0.5 mg/mL busulfan in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP as recommended for infusion reflects the pH of the diluent used and ranges from 3.4 to 3.9.</p>
<p>BUSULFEX is intended for dilution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP prior to intravenous infusion.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-4.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Busulfan is a bifunctional alkylating agent in which two labile methanesulfonate groups are attached to opposite ends of a four-carbon alkyl chain. In aqueous media, busulfan hydrolyzes to release the methanesulfonate groups. This produces reactive carbonium ions that can alkylate DNA. DNA damage is thought to be responsible for much of the cytotoxicity of busulfan.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-4.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of BUSULFEX were studied in 59 patients participating in a prospective trial of a BUSULFEX-cyclophosphamide preparatory regimen prior to allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor stem cell transplantation. Patients received 0.8 mg/kg BUSULFEX every six hours, for a total of 16 doses over four days. Fifty-five of fifty-nine patients (93%) administered BUSULFEX maintained AUC values below the target value (&lt;1500 ÂµMâ€¢min).</p>

<p>BUSULFEX pharmacokinetics showed consistency between dose 9 and dose 13 as demonstrated by reproducibility of steady state Cmax and a low coefficient of variation for this parameter.</p>
<p>In a pharmacokinetic study of BUSULFEX in 24 pediatric patients, the population pharmacokinetic (PPK) estimates of BUSULFEX for clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (V) were determined. For actual body weight, PPK estimates of CL and V were 4.04 L/hr/20 kg (3.37 ml/min/kg; interpatient variability 23%); and 12.8 L/20 kg (0.64 L/kg; interpatient variability 11%).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion:</span></p>
<p>Studies of distribution, metabolism, and elimination of BUSULFEX have not been done; however, the literature on oral busulfan is relevant. Additionally, for modulating effects on pharmacodynamic parameters see <span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Distribution:</span>Busulfan achieves concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid approximately equal to those in plasma. Irreversible binding to plasma elements, primarily albumin, has been estimated to be 32.4 Â± 2.2% which is consistent with the reactive electrophilic properties of busulfan.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Metabolism:</span>Busulfan is predominantly metabolized by conjugation with glutathione, both spontaneously and by glutathione S-transferase (GST) catalysis. This conjugate undergoes further extensive oxidative metabolism in the liver.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Excretion:</span>Following administration of <span class="Sup">14</span>C- labeled busulfan to humans, approximately 30% of the radioactivity was excreted into the urine over 48 hours; negligible amounts were recovered in feces. The incomplete recovery of radioactivity may be due to the formation of long-lived metabolites or due to nonspecific alkylation of macromolecules.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First">Documentation of the safety and efficacy of busulfan as a component of a conditioning regimen prior to allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell reconstitution is derived from two sources: i) analysis of a prospective clinical trial of BUSULFEX that involved 61 patients diagnosed with various hematologic malignancies, and ii) the published reports of randomized, controlled trials that employed high-dose oral busulfan as a component of a conditioning regimen for transplantation, which were identified in a literature review of five established commercial databases.</p>
<p>The prospective trial was a single-arm, open-label study in 61 patients who received BUSULFEX as part of a conditioning regimen for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The study included patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138708" conceptname="Acute leukemia">acute leukemia</span> past first remission (first or subsequent relapse), with high-risk first remission, or with induction failure; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134603" conceptname="Chronic myeloid leukemia">chronic myelogenous leukemia</span> (CML) in chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast crisis; primary refractory or resistant relapsed Hodgkinâ€™s disease or non-Hodgkinâ€™s <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span>; and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138994" conceptname="Myelodysplastic syndrome">myelodysplastic syndrome</span>. Forty-eight percent of patients (29/61) were heavily pretreated, defined as having at least one of the following: prior radiation, â‰¥3 prior chemotherapeutic regimens, or prior hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Seventy-five percent of patients (46/61) were transplanted with active disease.</p>
<p>Patients received 16 BUSULFEX doses of 0.8 mg/kg every 6 hours as a two-hour infusion for 4 days, followed by cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg once per day for two days (BuCy2 regimen). All patients received 100% of their scheduled BUSULFEX regimen. No dose adjustments were made. After one rest day, allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cells were infused. The efficacy parameters in this study were myeloablation (defined as one or more of the following: absolute neutrophil count [ANC] less than 0.5x10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L, absolute lymphocyte count [ALC] less than 0.1x10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span> defined as a platelet count less than 20,000/mm3 or a platelet transfusion requirement) and engraftment (ANCâ‰¥0.5x10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L).</p>
<p>All patients (61/61) experienced myeloablation. The median time to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span> was 4 days. All evaluable patients (60/60) engrafted at a median of 13 days post-transplant (range 9 to 29 days); one patient was considered non-evaluable because he died of a fungal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255848" conceptname="Pneumonia">pneumonia</span> 20 days after BMT and before engraftment occurred. All but 13 of the patients were treated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118659" conceptname="Prophylactic">prophylactic</span> G-CSF. Evidence of donor cell engraftment and chimerism was documented in all patients who had a chromosomal sex marker or leukemic marker (43/43), and no patient with chimeric evidence of allogeneic engraftment suffered a later loss of the allogeneic graft. There were no reports of graft failure in the overall study population. The median number of platelet transfusions per patient was 6, and the median number of red blood cell transfusions per patient was 4.</p>
<p>Twenty-three patients (38%) relapsed at a median of 183 days post-transplant (range 36 to 406 days). Sixty-two percent of patients (38/61) were free from disease with a median follow-up of 269 days post-transplant (range 20 to 583 days). Forty-three patients (70%) were alive with a median follow up of 288 days post-transplant (range 51 to 583 days). There were two <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> before BMT Day +28 and six additional patients died by BMT Day +100. Ten patients (16%) died after BMT Day +100, at a median of 199 days post-transplant (range 113 to 275 days).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Oral Busulfan Literature Review.</span>Four publications of randomized, controlled trials that evaluated a high-dose oral busulfan-containing conditioning regimen (busulfan 4 mg/kg/d x 4 days + cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/d x 2 days) for allogeneic transplantation in the setting of CML were identified. Two of the studies (Clift and Devergie) had populations confined to CML in chronic phase that were randomized between conditioning with busulfan/cyclophosphamide (BU/CY) and cyclophosphamide/total body irradiation (CY/TBI). A total of 138 patients were treated with BU/CY in these studies. The populations of the two remaining studies (Ringden and Blume) included patients with CML, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134305" conceptname="Acute lymphoid leukemia">acute lymphoblastic leukemia</span> (ALL), and acute myelogenous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315497" conceptname="Subacute leukemia">leukemia</span> (AML). In the Nordic BMT Group study published by Ringden, et al., 57 patients had CML, and of those, 30 were treated with BU/CY. Patients with CML in chronic phase, accelerated phase, and blast crisis were eligible for this study. The participants with CML (34/122 patients) in a SWOG study published by Blume, et al., had disease beyond first chronic phase. Twenty of those CML patients were treated with BU/CY, and the TBI comparator arm utilized etoposide instead of cyclophosphamide.</p>

<p class="First">BUSULFEX should be administered under the supervision of a qualified physician experienced in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Appropriate management of complications arising from its administration is possible only when adequate diagnostic and treatment facilities are readily available.</p>
<p>The following warnings pertain to different physiologic effects of BUSULFEX in the setting of allogeneic transplantation.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Hematologic:</span>The most frequent serious consequence of treatment with BUSULFEX at the recommended dose and schedule is profound <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4145241" conceptname="Bone marrow depression">myelosuppression</span>, occurring in all patients.

Frequent complete blood counts, including white blood cell differentials, and quantitative platelet counts should be monitored during treatment and until recovery is achieved. Absolute neutrophil counts dropped below 0.5x10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L at a median of 4 days post-transplant in 100% of patients treated in the BUSULFEX clinical trial. The absolute neutrophil count recovered at a median of 13 days following allogeneic transplantation when <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118659" conceptname="Prophylactic">prophylactic</span> G-CSF was used in the majority of patients. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">Thrombocytopenia</span> (&lt;25,000/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> or requiring platelet transfusion) occurred at a median of 5-6 days in 98% of patients. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">Anemia</span> (hemoglobin &lt;8.0 g/dL) occurred in 69% of patients.

<p><span class="Bold">Neurological:</span><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">Seizures</span> have been reported in patients receiving highdose oral busulfan at doses producing plasma drug levels similar to those achieved following the recommended dosage of BUSULFEX. Despite <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118659" conceptname="Prophylactic">prophylactic</span> therapy with phenytoin, one <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> (1/42 patients) was reported during an autologous transplantation clinical trial of BUSULFEX. This episode occurred during the cyclophosphamide portion of the conditioning regimen, 36 hours after the last BUSULFEX dose. Anti-convulsant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118659" conceptname="Prophylactic">prophylactic</span> therapy should be initiated prior to BUSULFEX treatment. Caution should be exercised when administering the recommended dose of BUSULFEX to patients with a history of a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> disorder or head <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433633" conceptname="Late effect of superficial injury">trauma</span> or who are receiving other potentially epileptogenic drugs.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Hepatic:</span>Current literature suggests that high busulfan area under the plasma concentration verses time curve (AUC) values (&gt;1,500 ÂµMâ€¢min) may be associated with an increased risk of developing hepatic venoocclusive disease (HVOD). Patients who have received prior radiation therapy, greater than or equal to three cycles of chemotherapy, or a prior progenitor cell transplant may be at an increased risk of developing HVOD with the recommended BUSULFEX dose and regimen. Based on clinical examination and laboratory findings, hepatic veno-occlusive disease was diagnosed in 8% (5/61) of patients treated with BUSULFEX in the setting of allogeneic transplantation, was fatal in 2/5 cases (40%), and yielded an overall mortality from HVOD in the entire study population of 2/61 (3%). Three of the five patients diagnosed with HVOD were retrospectively found to meet the Jonesâ€™ criteria. The incidence of HVOD reported in the literature from the randomized, controlled trials (see CLINICAL STUDIES) was 7.7%-12%.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Cardiac:</span><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318450" conceptname="Cardiac tamponade">Cardiac tamponade</span> has been reported in pediatric patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="30978" conceptname="Thalassemia">thalassemia</span> (8/400 or 2% in one series) who received high doses of oral busulfan and cyclophosphamide as the preparatory regimen for hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation.

<h2>Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Busulfan is a mutagen and a clastogen. In in vitro tests it caused mutations in <span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span> typhimurium</span>and <span class="Bold">Drosophila melanogaster</span>. Chromosomal aberrations induced by busulfan have been reported in vivo(rats, mice, hamsters, and humans) and in vitro (rodent and human cells). The intravenous administration of busulfan (48 mg/kg given as biweekly doses of 12 mg/kg, or 30% of the total BUSULFEX dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis ) has been shown to increase the incidence of thymic and ovarian tumors in mice. Four cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138708" conceptname="Acute leukemia">acute leukemia</span> occurred among 19 patients who became pancytopenic in a 243 patient study incorporating busulfan as adjuvant therapy following surgical resection of bronchogenic carcinoma. Clinical appearance of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315497" conceptname="Subacute leukemia">leukemia</span> was observed 5-8 years following oral busulfan treatment. Busulfan is a presumed human carcinogen.</p>
<p>Ovarian suppression and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443800" conceptname="Amenorrhea">amenorrhea</span> commonly occur in premenopausal women undergoing chronic, low-dose busulfan therapy for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134603" conceptname="Chronic myeloid leukemia">chronic myelogenous leukemia</span>. Busulfan depleted oocytes of female rats. Busulfan induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4035976" conceptname="Sterility">sterility</span> in male rats and hamsters. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4035976" conceptname="Sterility">Sterility</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="76744" conceptname="Azoospermia">azoospermia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438477" conceptname="Atrophy of testis">testicular atrophy</span> have been reported in male patients.</p>
<p>The solvent DMA may also impair fertility. A DMA daily dose of 0.45 g/kg/d given to rats for nine days (equivalent to 44% of the daily dose of DMA contained in the recommended dose of BUSULFEX on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) significantly decreased spermatogenesis in rats. A single sc dose of 2.2 g/kg (27% of the total DMA dose contained in BUSULFEX on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) four days after insemination terminated pregnancy in 100% of tested hamsters.</p>

<h2>Pregnancy</h2>
<p class="First">Busulfan may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Busulfan produced teratogenic changes in the offspring of mice, rats and rabbits when given during gestation. Malformations and anomalies included significant alterations in the musculoskeletal system, body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span>, and size. In pregnant rats, busulfan produced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4035976" conceptname="Sterility">sterility</span> in both male and female offspring due to the absence of germinal cells in the testes and ovaries. The solvent, DMA, may also cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In rats, DMA doses of 400 mg/kg/d (about 40% of the daily dose of DMA in the BUSULFEX dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) given during organogenesis caused significant developmental anomalies. The most striking abnormalities included <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4043107" conceptname="Anasarca">anasarca</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135923" conceptname="Cleft palate">cleft palate</span>, vertebral anomalies, rib anomalies, and serious anomalies of the vessels of the heart. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of either busulfan or DMA in pregnant women. If BUSULFEX is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving BUSULFEX, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant.</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-9.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Hematologic</h2>
<p class="First">At the recommended dosage of BUSULFEX (busulfan) Injection, profound <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4145241" conceptname="Bone marrow depression">myelosuppression</span> is universal, and can manifest as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span>, or a combination thereof.

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">The increased risk of a second malignancy should be explained to the patient.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34075-2">
<a name="section-9.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">Patients receiving BUSULFEX should be monitored daily with a complete blood count, including differential count and quantitative platelet count, until engraftment has been demonstrated.</p>
<p>To detect hepatotoxicity, which may herald the onset of hepatic venoocclusive disease, serum transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin should be evaluated daily through BMT Day +28.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34073-7">
<a name="section-9.4"></a><p></p>
<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Itraconazole decreases busulfan clearance by up to 25%, and may produce an AUC &gt; 1500 ÂµMâ€¢min in some patients. Fluconazole, and the 5-HT3 antiemetics odansetron (ZofranÂ®) and granisetron (KytrilÂ®) have all been used with BUSULFEX.</p>
<p>Phenytoin increases the clearance of busulfan by 15% or more, possibly due to the induction of glutathione-S-transferase. Since the pharmacokinetics of BUSULFEX were studied in patients treated with phenytoin, the clearance of BUSULFEX at the recommended dose may be lower and exposure (AUC) higher in patients not treated with phenytoin. Because busulfan is eliminated from the body via conjugation with glutathione, use of acetaminophen prior to (&lt;72 hours) or concurrent with BUSULFEX may result in reduced busulfan clearance based upon the known property of acetaminophen to decrease glutathione levels in the blood and tissues.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorgenicity shown for busulfan in human and animal studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<h2>Special Populations</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric:</span>The effectiveness of BUSULFEX in the treatment of CML has not been specifically studied in pediatric patients. An open-label, uncontrolled study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of BUSULFEX in 24 pediatric patients receiving BUSULFEX as part of a conditioning regimen administered prior to hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation for a variety of malignant hematologic (N=15) or non-malignant diseases (N=9). Patients ranged in age from 5 months to 16 years (median 3 years). BUSULFEX dosing was targeted to achieve an area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) of 900-1350 ÂµMâ€¢min with an initial dose of 0.8 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg (based on ABW) if the patient was &gt;4 or â‰¤4 years, respectively. The dose was adjusted based on plasma concentration after completion of dose 1.</p>
<p>Patients received BUSULFEX doses every six hours as a two-hour infusion over four days for a total of 16 doses, followed by cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg once daily for four days. After one rest day, hematopoietic progenitor cells were infused. All patients received phenytoin as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> prophylaxis. The target AUC (900-1350 Â± 5% ÂµMâ€¢min) for BUSULFEX was achieved at dose 1 in 71% (17/24) of patients. Steady state pharmacokinetic testing was performed at dose 9 and 13. BUSULFEX levels were within the target range for 21 of 23 evaluable patients.</p>
<p>All 24 patients experienced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span> (absolute neutrophil count &lt;0.5 x 10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span> (platelet transfusions or platelet count &lt;20,000/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>). Seventy-nine percent (19/24) of patients experienced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441541" conceptname="Lymphocytopenia">lymphopenia</span> (absolute lymphocyte count &lt;0.1 x 10<span class="Sup">9</span>). In 23 patients, the ANC recovered to &gt;0.5 x 10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L (median time to recovery = BMT day +13; range = BMT day +9 to +22). One patient who died on day +20 had not recovered to an ANC &gt; 0.5 x 10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L.</p>
<p>Four (17%) patients died during the study. Two patients died within 28 days of transplant; one with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255848" conceptname="Pneumonia">pneumonia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4227747" conceptname="Capillary leak syndrome">capillary leak syndrome</span>, and the other with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255848" conceptname="Pneumonia">pneumonia</span> and veno-occlusive disease. Two patients died prior to day 100; one due to progressive disease and one due to multi-organ failure.</p>
<p>Adverse events were reported in all 24 patients during the study period (BMT day -10 through BMT day +28) or post-study surveillance period (day +29 through +100). These included <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> (100%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> (83%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138455" conceptname="Stomatitis">stomatitis</span> (79%), hepatic veno-occlusive disease (HVOD) (21%), graft-versus host disease (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443216" conceptname="Graft versus host disease">GVHD</span>) (25%), and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255848" conceptname="Pneumonia">pneumonia</span> (21%).</p>

<p>Simulations based on a pediatric population pharmacokinetic model indicate that approximately 60% of pediatric patients will achieve a target BUSULFEX exposure (AUC) between 900 to 1350 ÂµMâ€¢min with the first dose of BUSULFEX using this dosing nomogram. Therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustment following the first dose of BUSULFEX is recommended.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Dose Adjustment Based on Therapeutic Drug Monitoring</span></p>
<p>Instructions for measuring the AUC of busulfan at dose 1 (see <span class="Bold">Blood Sample Collection for AUC Determination</span>), and the formula for adjustment of subsequent doses to achieve the desired target AUC (1125 ÂµMâ€¢min), are provided below.</p>
<p>Adjusted dose (mg) = Actual Dose (mg) x Target AUC (ÂµMâ€¢min)/Actual AUC (ÂµMâ€¢min)</p>
<p>For example, if a patient received a dose of 11 mg busulfan and if the corresponding AUC measured was 800 ÂµMâ€¢min, for a target AUC of 1125 ÂµMâ€¢min, the target mg dose would be:</p>
<p>Mg dose = 11 mg x 1125 ÂµMâ€¢min / 800 ÂµMâ€¢min = 15.5 mg</p>
<p>Busulfex dose adjustment may be made using this formula and instructions below.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Blood Sample Collection for AUC Determination:</span></span></p>
<p>Calculate the AUC (ÂµMâ€¢min) based on blood samples collected at the following time points:</p>
<p>For dose 1: 2 hr (end of infusion), 4 hr and 6 hr (immediately prior to the next scheduled BUSULFEX administration). <span class="Underline">Actual sampling times should be recorded.</span></p>
<p>For doses other than dose 1: Pre-infusion (baseline), 2 hr (end of infusion), 4 hr and 6 hr (immediately prior to the next scheduled BUSULFEX administration).</p>
<p><span class="Underline">AUC calculations based on fewer than the three specified samples may result in inaccurate AUC determinations.</span></p>
<p>For each scheduled blood sample, collect one to three mL of blood into heparinized (Na or Li heparin) VacutainerÂ® tubes. The blood samples should be placed on wet ice immediately after collection and should be centrifuged (at 4Â°C) within one hour. The plasma, harvested into appropriate cryovial storage tubes, is to be frozen immediately at -20Â°C. All plasma samples are to be sent in a frozen state (i.e., on dry ice) to the assay laboratory for the determination of plasma busulfan concentrations.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Calculation of AUC:</span></p>
<p>BUSULFEX AUC calculations may be made using the following instructions and appropriate standard pharmacokinetic formula:</p>
<p>Dose 1 AUC<span class="Sub">infinity</span> Calculation: AUC<span class="Sub">infinity</span>= AUC<span class="Sub">0-6hr</span>+ AUC<span class="Sub">extrapolated</span>,</p>
<p>where AUC<span class="Sub">0-6hr</span> is to be estimated using the linear trapezoidal rule and AUC extrapolated can be computed by taking the ratio of the busulfan concentration at Hour 6 and the terminal elimination rate constant, z. The z must be calculated from the terminal elimination phase of the busulfan concentration vs. time curve. A â€œ0â€? pre-dose busulfan concentration should be assumed, and used in the calculation of AUC.</p>
<p>If the AUC is assessed subsequent to Dose 1, steady-state AUC<span class="Sub">ss</span> (AUC<span class="Sub">0-6hr</span>) is to be estimated from the trough, 2 hr, 4 hr and 6 hr concentrations using the linear trapezoidal rule.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Instructions for Drug Administration and Blood Sample Collection for Therapeutic Drug Monitoring:</span></span></p>
<p>An administration set with minimal residual hold up (priming) volume (1-3 mL) should be used for drug infusion to ensure accurate delivery of the entire prescribed dose and to ensure accurate collection of blood samples for therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustment.</p>
<p>Prime the administration set tubing with drug solution to allow accurate documentation of the start time of BUSULFEX infusion. Collect the blood sample from a peripheral IV line to avoid contamination with infusing drug. If the blood sample is taken directly from the existing central venous catheter (CVC), <span class="Bold"><span class="Underline">DO NOT COLLECT THE BLOOD SAMPLE WHILE THE DRUG IS INFUSING</span></span><span class="Bold"></span>to ensure that the end of infusion sample is not contaminated with any residual drug. At the end of infusion (2 hr), disconnect the administration tubing and flush the CVC line with 5 cc of normal saline prior to the collection of the end of infusion sample from the CVC port. Collect the blood samples from a different port than that used for the BUSULFEX infusion. When recording the BUSULFEX infusion stop time, do not include the time required to flush the indwelling catheter line. Discard the administration tubing at the end of the two-hour infusion.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Dimethylacetamide (DMA), the solvent used in the BUSULFEX formulation, was studied in 1962 as a potential cancer chemotherapy drug. In a Phase 1 trial, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 14.8 g/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/d for four days. The daily recommended dose of BUSULFEX contains DMA equivalent to 42% of the MTD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. The dose-limiting toxicities in the Phase 1 study were hepatotoxicity as evidenced by increased liver transaminase (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4094657" conceptname="Aspartate aminotransferase">SGOT</span>) levels and neurological symptoms as evidenced by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span>. The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span> had a pattern of onset at one day post completion of DMA administration and were associated with EEG changes. The lowest dose at which <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span> were recognized was equivalent to 1.9 times that delivered in a conditioning regimen utilizing BUSULFEX 0.8 mg/kg every 6 hours x 16 doses. Other neurological toxicities included <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4061577" conceptname="Lethargy">lethargy</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>. The relative contribution of DMA and/or other concomitant medications to neurologic and hepatic toxicities observed with BUSULFEX is difficult to ascertain.</p>
<p>Treatment with BUSULFEX at the recommended dose and schedule will result in profound <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4145241" conceptname="Bone marrow depression">myelosuppression</span> in 100% of patients, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218497" conceptname="Granulocytopenic disorder">granulocytopenia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span>, or a combined loss of formed elements of the blood.</p>

<h2>BUSULFEX Clinical Trials</h2>
<p class="First">In the BUSULFEX (busulfan) Injection allogeneic stem cell transplantation clinical trial, all patients were treated with BUSULFEX 0.8 mg/kg as a two-hour infusion every six hours for 16 doses over four days, combined with cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg x 2 days. Ninety-three percent (93%) of evaluable patients receiving this dose of BUSULFEX maintained an AUC less than 1,500 ÂµMâ€¢min for dose 9, which has generally been considered the level that minimizes the risk of HVOD.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">There is no known antidote to BUSULFEX other than hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation. In the absence of hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation, the recommended dosage for BUSULFEX would constitute an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> of busulfan. The principal toxic effect is profound bone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4145241" conceptname="Bone marrow depression">marrow hypoplasia</span>/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4166825" conceptname="Aplasia">aplasia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432881" conceptname="Pancytopenia">pancytopenia</span>, but the central nervous system, liver, lungs, and gastro intestinal tract may be affected. The hematologic status should be closely monitored and vigorous supportive measures instituted as medically indicated. Survival after a single 140 mg dose of MyleranÂ® Tablets in an 18 kg, 4-year old child has been reported. Inadvertent administration of a greater than normal dose of oral busulfan (2.1 mg/kg; total dose of 23.3 mg/kg) occurred in a 2-year old child prior to a scheduled bone marrow transplant without sequelae. An acute dose of 2.4 g was fatal in a 10-year old boy. There is one report that busulfan is dialyzable, thus dialysis should be considered in the case of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. Busulfan is metabolized by conjugation with glutathione, thus administration of glutathione may be considered.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34068-7">
<a name="section-12"></a><p></p>
<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">When BUSULFEX (busulfan) Injection is administered as a component of the BuCy conditioning regimen prior to bone marrow or peripheral blood progenitor cell replacement, the recommended doses are as follows:</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Adults (BuCy2):</span>The usual adult dose is 0.8 mg/kg of ideal body weight or actual body weight, whichever is lower, administered every six hours for four days (a total of 16 doses). For obese, or severely obese patients, BUSULFEX should be administered based on adjusted ideal body weight. Ideal body weight (IBW) should be calculated as follows (height in cm, and weight in kg): IBW (kg; men)= 50 + 0.91x (height in cm -152); IBW (kg; women)= 45 + 0.91x (height in cm - 152). Adjusted ideal body weight (AIBW) should be calculated as follows: AIBW= IBW + 0.25x (actual weight -IBW). Cyclophosphamide is given on each of two days as a one-hour infusion at a dose of 60 mg/kg beginning on BMT day â€“3, no sooner than six hours following the 16 th dose of BUSULFEX.</p>
<p>BUSULFEX clearance is best predicted when the BUSULFEX dose is administered based on adjusted ideal body weight. Dosing BUSULFEX based on actual body weight, ideal body weight or other factors can produce significant differences in BUSULFEX (busulfan) Injection clearance among lean, normal and obese patients.</p>
<p>BUSULFEX should be administered intravenously via a central venous catheter as a two-hour infusion every six hours for four consecutive days for a total of 16 doses. All patients should be premedicated with phenytoin as busulfan is known to cross the blood brain barrier and induce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>. Phenytoin reduces busulfan plasma AUC by 15%. Use of other anticonvulsants may result in higher busulfan plasma AUCs, and an increased risk of VOD or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>. In cases where other anticonvulsants must be used, plasma busulfan exposure should be monitored (See DRUG INTERACTIONS). Antiemetics should be administered prior to the first dose of BUSULFEX and continued on a fixed schedule through administration of BUSULFEX. Where available, pharmacokinetic monitoring may be considered to further optimize therapeutic targeting.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pediatrics:</span>The effectiveness of BUSULFEX in the treatment of CML has not been specifically studied in pediatric patients. For additional information see Special Populations -Pediatric section.</p>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-12.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Preparation and Administration Precautions:</h2>
<p class="First">An administration set with minimal residual hold-up volume (2-5 cc) should be used for product administration.</p>
<p>As with other cytotoxic compounds, caution should be exercised in handling and preparing the solution of BUSULFEX. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089139" conceptname="Skin reaction">Skin reactions</span> may occur with accidental exposure. The use of gloves is recommended. If BUSULFEX or diluted BUSULFEX solution contacts the skin or mucosa, wash the skin or mucosa thoroughly with water. BUSULFEX is a clear, colorless solution. Parenteral drug products should be visually inspected for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever the solution and container permit. If particulate matter is seen in the BUSULFEX ampoule the drug should not be used.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-12.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Preparation for Intravenous Administration:</h2>
<p class="First">BUSULFEX must be diluted prior to use with either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (normal saline) or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP (D<span class="Sub">5</span>W). The diluent quantity should be 10 times the volume of BUSULFEX, so that the final concentration of busulfan is approximately 0.5 mg/mL. Calculation of the dose for a 70 kg patient, would be performed as follows:</p>
<p>(70kg patient) x (0.8 mg/kg) Ã· (6 mg/mL) = 9.3 mL BUSULFEX (56 mg total dose).</p>
<p>To prepare the final solution for infusion, add 9.3 mL of BUSULFEX to 93 mL of diluent (normal saline or D<span class="Sub">5</span>W) as calculated below:</p>
<p>(9.3 mL BUSULFEX)x(10)=93 mL of either diluent plus the 9.3 mL of BUSULFEX to yield a final concentration of busulfan of 0.54 mg/mL (9.3 mL x 6 mg/mL Ã· 102.3 mL = 0.54 mg/mL).</p>
<p>All transfer procedures require strict adherence to aseptic techniques, preferably employing a vertical laminar flow safety hood while wearing gloves and protective clothing.</p>
<p>DO NOT put the BUSULFEX into an intravenous bag or large-volume syringe that does not contain normal saline or D<span class="Sub">5</span>W. Always add the BUSULFEX to the diluent, not the diluent to the BUSULFEX. Mix thoroughly by inverting several times. DO NOT USE POLYCARBONATE SYRINGES OR POLYCARBONATE FILTER NEEDLES WITH BUSULFEX.</p>
<p>Infusion pumps should be used to administer the diluted BUSULFEX solution. Set the flow rate of the pump to deliver the entire prescribed BUSULFEX dose over two hours. Prior to and following each infusion, flush the indwelling catheter line with approximately 5mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP. DO NOT infuse concomitantly with another intravenous solution of unknown compatibility. WARNING: RAPID INFUSION OF BUSULFEX HAS NOT BEEN TESTED AND IS NOT RECOMMENDED.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">STABILITY</span></p>
<p>Unopened vials of BUSULFEX are stable until the date indicated on the package when stored under refrigeration at 2Â°-8Â°C (36Â°-46Â°F).</p>
<p>BUSULFEX diluted in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP is stable at room temperature (25Â°C) for up to 8 hours but the infusion must be completed within that time. BUSULFEX diluted in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP is stable at refrigerated conditions (2Â°-8Â°C) for up to 12 hours but the infusion must be completed within that time.</p>
