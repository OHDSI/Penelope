<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First"><a name="P2"></a>THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (Tiopronin) is a reducing and complexing thiol compound. Tiopronin is N-(2-Mercaptopropionyl) glycine and has the following structure:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="tiopronin-struct" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=494a714e-923c-cd57-df6c-12886afb265a&amp;name=Tiopronin-struct.jpg"></div>
<p><a name="p4864222"></a>Tiopronin has the empirical formula C5H9NO3S and a molecular weight of 163.20. In this drug product tiopronin exists as a dl racemic mixture.</p>
<p><a name="p4869122"></a>Tiopronin is a white crystalline powder which is freely soluble in water.</p>
<p><a name="p4871122"></a>THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> tablets are white, sugar coated tablets, each containing 100 mg. of Tiopronin and are taken orally.</p>
<p><a name="p4873122"></a>Inactive ingredients: Calcium carbonate, carnauba wax, ethyl cellulose, Eudragit E 100, hydroxy-propyl cellulose, lactose, magnesium stearate, povidone, sugar, talc, titanium dioxide.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"><a name="G544cacb3-06ea-4945-a4d0-2117e6bbfb32"></a>THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> is an active reducing agent which undergoes thiol-disulfide exchange with cystine to form a mixed disulfide of Thiola-cysteine.</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="thiola-formula" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=494a714e-923c-cd57-df6c-12886afb265a&amp;name=thiola-formula.jpg"></div>
<p><a name="p4881222"></a>From this reaction, a water-soluble mixed disulfide is formed and the amount of sparingly soluble cystine is reduced. When THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> is given orally, up to 48% of dose appears in urine during the first 4 hours and up to 78% by 72 hours. Thus, in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4225406" conceptname="Cystinuria">cystinuria</span>, sufficient amount of THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> or its active metabolites could appear in urine to react with cystine, lowering cystine excretion.</p>
<p><a name="p4883122"></a>The decrement in urinary cystine produced by THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> is generally proportional to the dose. A reduction in urinary cystine of 250-350 mg/day at a THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> dosage of 1 g/day, and a decline of approximately 500 mg/day at a dosage of 2 g/day, might be expected. THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> causes a sustained reduction in cystine excretion without apparent loss of effectiveness. THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> has a rapid onset and offset of action, showing a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> in cystine excretion on the first day of administration and a rise on the first day of drug withdrawal.</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First"><a name="P16"></a>THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> is indicated for the prevention of cystine (kidney) stone formation in patients with severe homozygous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4225406" conceptname="Cystinuria">cystinuria</span> with urinary cystine greater than 500 mg/day, who are resistant to treatment with conservative measures of high fluid intake, alkali and diet modification, or who have adverse reactions to d-penicillamine.</p>
<p><a name="p4364722"></a>Cystine stones typically occur in approximately 10,000 persons in the United States who are homozygous for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4225406" conceptname="Cystinuria">cystinuria</span>. These persons excrete abnormal amounts of cystine in urine of over 250 mg/g creatinine, as well as excessive amounts of other dibasic amino acids (lysine, arginine and ornithine). In addition, they show varying intestinal transport defects for these same amino acids. The stone formation is the result of poor aqueous solubility of cystine.</p>
<p><a name="p4637922"></a>Since there are no known inhibitors of the crystallization of cystine, the stone formation is determined primarily by the urinary supersaturation of cystine. Thus, cystine stones could theoretically form whenever urinary cystine concentration exceeds the solubility limit. Cystine solubility in urine is pH-dependent, and ranges from 170-300 mg/liter at pH 5, 190-400 mg/liter at pH 7 and 220-500 mg/liter at pH 7.5.</p>
<p><a name="p4644722"></a>The goal of therapy is to reduce urinary cystine concentration below its solubility limit. It may be accomplished by dietary means aimed at reducing cystine synthesis and by a high fluid intake in order to increase urine volume and thereby lower cystine concentration.</p>
<p><a name="p4640722"></a>Unfortunately, the above conservative measures alone may be ineffective in controlling cystine stone formation in some homozygous patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4225406" conceptname="Cystinuria">cystinuria</span> (urinary cystine exceeding 500 mg/day). In such patients, d-penicillamine has been used as an additional therapy. Like THIOLA<span class="Sup">â„¢</span>, dpenicillamine undergoes thiol-disulfide exchange with cystine, thereby lowering the amount of sparingly soluble cystine in urine.</p>
<p><a name="p46211022"></a>However, d-penicillamine treatment is frequently accompanied by adverse reactions, such as dermatologic complications, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span>, hematologic abnormalities and renal disturbances. THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> may have a particular therapeutic role in such patients.</p>

<h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h1>
<p class="First"><a name="P17"></a>The use of THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> during pregnancy is contraindicated, except in those with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4225406" conceptname="Cystinuria">cystinuria</span> where the anticipated benefit of inhibited stone formation clearly outweighs possible hazards of treatment (see <a href="#s6">PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>
<p><a name="p4647622"></a>THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> should not be begun again in patients with a prior history of developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440689" conceptname="Agranulocytosis">agranulocytosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137829" conceptname="Aplastic anemia">aplastic anemia</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span> on this medication.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First"><a name="P18"></a>Despite apparent lower toxicity of THIOLA<span class="Sup">â„¢</span>, THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> may potentially cause all the serious adverse reactions reported for d-penicillamine. Thus, although no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> has been reported to result directly from THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> treatment, a fatal outcome from THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> is possible, as has been reported with d-penicillamine therapy from such complications as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137829" conceptname="Aplastic anemia">aplastic anemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440689" conceptname="Agranulocytosis">agranulocytosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span>, Goodpastureâ€™s syndrome or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="76685" conceptname="Myasthenia gravis">myasthenia gravis</span>.</p>
<p><a name="p4616922"></a><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435224" conceptname="Leukopenia">Leukopenia</span> of the granulocytic series may develop without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302954" conceptname="Disorder characterized by eosinophilia">eosinophilia</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">Thrombocytopenia</span> may be immunologic in origin or occur on an idiosyncratic basis. The reduction in peripheral blood white count to less than 3500/cubic mm or in platelet count to below 100,000 cubic mm mandates cessation of therapy. Patients should be instructed to report promptly the occurrence of any symptom or sign of these hematological abnormalities, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="26711" conceptname="Chronic pharyngitis">sore throat</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4190045" conceptname="Rigor">chills</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> or easy bruisability.</p>

A close observation of affected patients is mandatory.</p>
<p><a name="p4636622"></a>The following complications, though rare, have been reported during d-penicillamine therapy and could occur during THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> treatment. When there are abnormal urinary findings associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="261687" conceptname="Hemoptysis">hemoptysis</span> and pulmonary infiltrates suggestive of Goodpastureâ€™s syndrome, THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> treatment should be stopped. Appearance of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4237155" conceptname="Eaton-Lambert syndrome">myasthenic syndrome</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="76685" conceptname="Myasthenia gravis">myasthenia gravis</span> requires cessation of treatment. When <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135338" conceptname="Pemphigus">pemphigus</span>-type reactions develop, THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> therapy should be stopped. Steroid treatment may be necessary.</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"><a name="G2a2c5bba-d15c-4863-b96f-bc25705b20b6"></a>Patients should be advised of the potential development of complications and to report promptly the occurrence of any symptom or sign of them.</p>
<p><a name="p4610722"></a>To help monitor potential complications, the following tests are recommended: peripheral blood counts, direct platelet count, hemoglobin, serum albumin, liver function tests, 24-hour urinary protein and routine urinalysis at 3- 6 month intervals during treatment. In order to assess effect on stone disease, urinary cystine analysis should be monitored frequently during the first 6 months when the optimum dose schedule is being determined, and at 6-month intervals thereafter. Abdominal roentogenogram (KUB) is advised on a yearly basis to monitor the size and appearance/disappearance of stone(s).</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"><a name="P31"></a>Some patients may develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">drug fever</span>, usually during the first month of therapy. THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> treatment should be discontinued until the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span> subsides. It may be reinstated at a small dose, with a gradual increase in dosage until the desired level is achieved.</p>
<p><a name="p35891222"></a>A generalized <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> (erythematous, maculopapular or morbilliform) accompanied by pruritis may develop during the first few months of treatment. It may be controlled by antihistamine therapy, typically recedes when THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> treatment is discontinued, and seldom recurs when THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> treatment is restarted at a lower dosage. Less commonly, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> may appear late in the course of treatment (of more than 6 months). Located usually in the trunk, the late <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> is associated with intense pruritis, recedes slowly after discontinuing treatment, and usually recurs upon resumption of treatment.</p>
<p><a name="p35841122"></a>A drug reaction simulating lupus erythematous, manifested by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77074" conceptname="Joint pain">arthralgia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315085" conceptname="Lymphadenopathy">lymphadenopathy</span> may develop. It may be associated with a positive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4163958" conceptname="Antinuclear antibody">antinuclear antibody</span> test, but not necessarily with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">nephropathy</span>. It may require discontinuance of THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> treatment.</p>
<p><a name="p35861022"></a>A reduction in taste perception may develop. It is believed to be the result of chelation of trace metals by THIOLA<span class="Sup">â„¢</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44783805" conceptname="Hypogeusia">Hypogeusia</span> is often self-limiting.</p>
<p><a name="p3590922"></a>Unlike during d-penicillamine therapy, vitamin B6 deficiency is uncommonly associated with THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> treatment.</p>
<p><a name="p43591222"></a>Some patients may complain of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013892" conceptname="Crow's feet">wrinkling</span> and friability of skin. This complication usually occurs after long-term treatment, and is believed to result from the effect of THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> on collagen.</p>
<p><a name="p43901422"></a>A multiclinic trial involving 66 cystinuric patients in the United States indicated that THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> is associated with fewer or less severe adverse reactions than d-penicillamine. Among those who had to stop taking d-penicillamine due to toxicity, 64.7% could take THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> . In those without prior history of d-penicillamine treatment, only 5.9% developed reactions of sufficient severity to require THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> withdrawal. A review of available literature supports the findings from this trial.</p>
<p><a name="p4374922"></a>Despite this apparent reduced toxicity to THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> relative to d-penicillamine, THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> treatment may potentially be associated with all the adverse reactions reported with d-penicillamine. They include:<br>â€†â€†â€†â€†â€†â€†â€†â€†â€†â€†â€†Gastrointestinal side-effects (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First"><a name="P39"></a>It is recommended that a conservative treatment program should be attempted first. At least 3 liters of fluid (10-10 oz. glassfuls) should be provided, including two glasses with each meal and at bedtime. The patients should be expected to awake at night to urinate; they should drink two more glasses of fluids before returning to bed. Additional fluids should be consumed if there is excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span> or intestinal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435796" conceptname="Dehydration">fluid loss</span>. A minimum urine output of 2 liters/day on a consistent basis should be sought. A modest amount of alkali should be provided in order to maintain urinary pH at a high normal range (6.5-7.0). Potassium alkali are advantageous over sodium alkali, because they do not cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4215809" conceptname="Hypercalciuria">hypercalciuria</span> and are less likely to cause the complication of calcium stones.</p>
<p><a name="p36121522"></a>Excessive alkali therapy is not advisable. When urinary pH increases above 7.0 with alkali therapy, the complication of calcium phosphate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201620" conceptname="Kidney stone">nephrolithiasis</span> may ensue because of the enhanced urinary supersaturation of hydroxyapatite in an alkaline environment.</p>
<p><a name="p36161522"></a>In patients who continue to form cystine stones on the above conservative program, THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> may be added to the treatment program. THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> may also be substituted for d-penicillamine in patients who have developed toxicity to the latter drug. In both situations, the conservative treatment program should be continued.</p>
<p><a name="p36071322"></a>The dose of THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> should not be arbitrary but should be based on that amount required to reduce urinary cystine concentration to below its solubility limit (generally &lt;250 mg/liter). The extent of the decline in cystine excretion is generally dependent on the THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> dosage.</p>
<p><a name="p36091322"></a>THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> may be begun at a dosage of 800 mg/day in adult patients with cystine stones. In a multiclinic trial, average dose of THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> was about 1000 mg/day. However, some patients require a smaller dose. In children, initial dosage may be based on 15 mg/kg/day. Urinary cystine should be measured at 1 month after THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> treatment, and every 3 months thereafter. THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> dosage should be readjusted depending on the urinary cystine value. Whenever possible, THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> should be given in divided doses 3 times/day at least one hour before or 2 hours after meals.</p>
<p><a name="p3619022"></a>In patients who had shown severe toxicity to d-penicillamine, THIOLA<span class="Sup">Â®</span> might be begun at a lower dosage.</p>
