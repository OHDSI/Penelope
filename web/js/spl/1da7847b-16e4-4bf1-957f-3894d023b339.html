<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">VIAGRA<span class="Sup">®</span>, an oral therapy for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">erectile dysfunction</span>, is the citrate salt of sildenafil, a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5).</p>
<p>Sildenafil citrate is designated chemically as 1-[[3-(6,7-dihydro-1-methyl-7-oxo-3-propyl-1<span class="Italics">H</span>-pyrazolo[4,3-<span class="Italics">d</span>]pyrimidin-5-yl)-4-ethoxyphenyl]sulfonyl]-4-methylpiperazine citrate and has the following structural formula:</p>

<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">The physiologic mechanism of erection of the penis involves release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation. NO then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">muscle relaxation</span> in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">muscle relaxation</span> and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil at recommended doses has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.</p>
<p>Studies <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> have shown that sildenafil is selective for PDE5. Its effect is more potent on PDE5 than on other known phosphodiesterases (10-fold for PDE6, &gt;80-fold for PDE1, &gt;700-fold for PDE2, PDE3, PDE4, PDE7, PDE8, PDE9, PDE10, and PDE11). The approximately 4,000-fold selectivity for PDE5 versus PDE3 is important because PDE3 is involved in control of cardiac contractility. Sildenafil is only about 10-fold as potent for PDE5 compared to PDE6, an enzyme found in the retina which is involved in the phototransduction pathway of the retina. This lower selectivity is thought to be the basis for abnormalities related to color vision observed with higher doses or plasma levels (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ClinPharm-PharmDyn">Pharmacodynamics</a></span>).</p>
<p>In addition to human corpus cavernosum smooth muscle, PDE5 is also found in lower concentrations in other tissues including platelets, vascular and visceral smooth muscle, and skeletal muscle. The inhibition of PDE5 in these tissues by sildenafil may be the basis for the enhanced platelet antiaggregatory activity of nitric oxide observed <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>, an inhibition of platelet thrombus formation <span class="Italics">in vivo </span>and peripheral arterial-venous dilatation <span class="Italics">in vivo</span>.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</h2>
<p class="First">VIAGRA is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a mean absolute bioavailability of 41% (range 25–63%).  Its pharmacokinetics are dose-proportional over the recommended dose range. It is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism (mainly cytochrome P450 3A4) and is converted to an active metabolite with properties similar to the parent, sildenafil. The concomitant use of potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole) as well as the nonspecific CYP inhibitor, cimetidine, is associated with increased plasma levels of sildenafil (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Dos-Admin">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>). Both sildenafil and the metabolite have terminal half lives of about 4 hours.</p>
<p>Mean sildenafil plasma concentrations measured after the administration of a single oral dose of 100 mg to healthy male volunteers is depicted below:</p>

<h3>Absorption and Distribution</h3>
<p class="First">VIAGRA is rapidly absorbed. Maximum observed plasma concentrations are reached within 30 to 120 minutes (median 60 minutes) of oral dosing in the fasted state. When VIAGRA is taken with a high fat meal, the rate of absorption is reduced, with a mean delay in T<span class="Sub">max</span> of 60 minutes and a mean reduction in C<span class="Sub">max</span> of 29%. The mean steady state volume of distribution (Vss) for sildenafil is 105 L, indicating distribution into the tissues. Sildenafil and its major circulating N-desmethyl metabolite are both approximately 96% bound to plasma proteins. Protein binding is independent of total drug concentrations.</p>
<p>Based upon measurements of sildenafil in semen of healthy volunteers 90 minutes after dosing, less than 0.001% of the administered dose may appear in the semen of patients.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-2.2.2"></a><p></p>
<h3>Metabolism and Excretion</h3>
<p class="First">Sildenafil is cleared predominantly by the CYP3A4 (major route) and CYP2C9 (minor route) hepatic microsomal isoenzymes. The major circulating metabolite results from N-desmethylation of sildenafil, and is itself further metabolized. This metabolite has a PDE selectivity profile similar to sildenafil and an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> potency for PDE5 approximately 50% of the parent drug. Plasma concentrations of this metabolite are approximately 40% of those seen for sildenafil, so that the metabolite accounts for about 20% of sildenafil's pharmacologic effects. </p>
<p>After either oral or intravenous administration, sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (approximately 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 13% of the administered oral dose). Similar values for pharmacokinetic parameters were seen in normal volunteers and in the patient population, using a population pharmacokinetic approach.</p>

<a name="section-2.3.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Geriatrics</h3>
<p class="First">Healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of sildenafil, resulting in approximately 84% and 107% higher plasma AUC values of sildenafil and its active N-desmethyl metabolite, respectively, compared to those seen in healthy younger volunteers (18–45 years).  Due to age-differences in plasma protein binding, the corresponding increase in the AUC of free (unbound) sildenafil and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were 45% and 57%, respectively.</p>

<h3><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span></h3>
<p class="First">In volunteers with mild (CLcr=50–80 mL/min) and moderate (CLcr=30–49 mL/min) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of VIAGRA (50 mg) were not altered. In volunteers with severe (CLcr=&lt;30 mL/min) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, sildenafil clearance was reduced, resulting in approximately doubling of AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> compared to age-matched volunteers with no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>.</p>
<p>In addition, N-desmethyl metabolite AUC and Cmax values significantly increased 200% and 79% respectively in subjects with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> compared to subjects with normal renal function.</p>

<h3><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">Hepatic Insufficiency</span></h3>
<p class="First">In volunteers with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4064161" conceptname="Cirrhosis of liver">hepatic cirrhosis</span> (Child-Pugh A and B), sildenafil clearance was reduced, resulting in increases in AUC (85%) and C<span class="Sub">max</span> (47%) compared to age-matched volunteers with no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>. The pharmacokinetics of sildenafil in patients with severely impaired hepatic function (Child Pugh class C) have not been studied.</p>
<p>Therefore, age &gt;65, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> and severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> are associated with increased plasma levels of sildenafil.

<h3>Effects of VIAGRA on Erectile Response</h3>
<p class="First">In eight double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies of patients with either organic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4248433" conceptname="Psychogenic impotence">psychogenic erectile dysfunction</span>, sexual stimulation resulted in improved erections, as assessed by an objective measurement of hardness and duration of erections (RigiScan<span class="Sup">®</span>), after VIAGRA administration compared with placebo. Most studies assessed the efficacy of VIAGRA approximately 60 minutes post dose. The erectile response, as assessed by RigiScan<span class="Sup">®</span>, generally increased with increasing sildenafil dose and plasma concentration. The time course of effect was examined in one study, showing an effect for up to 4 hours but the response was diminished compared to 2 hours.</p>

<h3>Effects of VIAGRA on Blood Pressure</h3>
<p class="First">Single oral doses of sildenafil (100 mg) administered to healthy volunteers produced decreases in sitting blood pressure (mean maximum decrease in systolic/diastolic blood pressure of 8.3/5.3 mmHg). The decrease in sitting blood pressure was most notable approximately 1–2 hours after dosing, and was not different than placebo at 8 hours. Similar effects on blood pressure were noted with 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg of VIAGRA, therefore the effects are not related to dose or plasma levels within this dosage range. Larger effects were recorded among patients receiving concomitant nitrates (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ContraInd">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span>).</p>

<h3>Effects of VIAGRA on Cardiac Parameters</h3>
<p class="First">Single oral doses of sildenafil up to 100 mg produced no clinically relevant changes in the ECGs of normal male volunteers.</p>
<p>Studies have produced relevant data on the effects of VIAGRA on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span>. In one small, open-label, uncontrolled, pilot study, eight patients with stable <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4124683" conceptname="Silent myocardial ischemia">ischemic heart disease</span> underwent Swan-Ganz catheterization. A total dose of 40 mg sildenafil was administered by four intravenous infusions.</p>
<p>The results from this pilot study are shown in Table 1; the mean resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased by 7% and 10% compared to baseline in these patients. Mean resting values for right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary artery occluded pressure and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4313695" conceptname="Decreased cardiac output">cardiac output decreased</span> by 28%, 28%, 20% and 7% respectively. Even though this total dosage produced plasma sildenafil concentrations which were approximately 2 to 5 times higher than the mean maximum plasma concentrations following a single oral dose of 100 mg in healthy male volunteers, the hemodynamic response to exercise was preserved in these patients.</p>

<p>In a double-blind study, 144 patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">erectile dysfunction</span> and chronic stable angina limited by exercise, not receiving chronic oral nitrates, were randomized to a single dose of placebo or VIAGRA 100 mg 1 hour prior to exercise testing. The primary endpoint was time to limiting angina in the evaluable cohort. The mean times (adjusted for baseline) to onset of limiting angina were 423.6 and 403.7 seconds for sildenafil (N=70) and placebo, respectively. These results demonstrated that the effect of VIAGRA on the primary endpoint was statistically non-inferior to placebo.</p>

<h3>Effects of VIAGRA on Vision</h3>
<p class="First">At single oral doses of 100 mg and 200 mg, transient dose-related impairment of color discrimination (blue/green) was detected using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test, with peak effects near the time of peak plasma levels. This finding is consistent with the inhibition of PDE6, which is involved in phototransduction in the retina. An evaluation of visual function at doses up to twice the maximum recommended dose revealed no effects of VIAGRA on visual acuity, intraocular pressure, or pupillometry.</p>

<h2>Clinical Studies</h2>
<p class="First">In clinical studies, VIAGRA was assessed for its effect on the ability of men with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">erectile dysfunction</span> (ED) to engage in sexual activity and in many cases specifically on the ability to achieve and maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual activity. VIAGRA was evaluated primarily at doses of 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg in 21 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of up to 6 months in duration, using a variety of study designs (fixed dose, titration, parallel, crossover). VIAGRA was administered to more than 3,000 patients aged 19 to 87 years, with ED of various etiologies (organic, psychogenic, mixed) with a mean duration of 5 years. VIAGRA demonstrated statistically significant improvement compared to placebo in all 21 studies. The studies that established benefit demonstrated improvements in success rates for sexual intercourse compared with placebo.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of VIAGRA was evaluated in most studies using several assessment instruments. The primary measure in the principal studies was a sexual function questionnaire (the International Index of Erectile Function - IIEF) administered during a 4-week treatment-free run-in period, at baseline, at follow-up visits, and at the end of double-blind, placebo-controlled, at-home treatment. Two of the questions from the IIEF served as primary study endpoints; categorical responses were elicited to questions about (1) the ability to achieve erections sufficient for sexual intercourse and (2) the maintenance of erections after penetration. The patient addressed both questions at the final visit for the last 4 weeks of the study. The possible categorical responses to these questions were (0) no attempted intercourse, (1) never or almost never, (2) a few times, (3) sometimes, (4) most times, and (5) almost always or always. Also collected as part of the IIEF was information about other aspects of sexual function, including information on erectile function, orgasm, desire, satisfaction with intercourse, and overall sexual satisfaction. Sexual function data were also recorded by patients in a daily diary. In addition, patients were asked a global efficacy question and an optional partner questionnaire was administered.</p>
<p>The effect on one of the major end points, maintenance of erections after penetration, is shown in Figure 3, for the pooled results of 5 fixed-dose, dose-response studies of greater than one month duration, showing response according to baseline function. Results with all doses have been pooled, but scores showed greater improvement at the 50 and 100 mg doses than at 25 mg. The pattern of responses was similar for the other principal question, the ability to achieve an erection sufficient for intercourse. The titration studies, in which most patients received 100 mg, showed similar results. Figure 3 shows that regardless of the baseline levels of function, subsequent function in patients treated with VIAGRA was better than that seen in patients treated with placebo. At the same time, on-treatment function was better in treated patients who were less impaired at baseline.</p>

These patients had <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">erectile dysfunction</span> at baseline that was characterized by median categorical scores of 2 (a few times) on principal IIEF questions. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">Erectile dysfunction</span> was attributed to organic (58%; generally not characterized, but including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> and excluding <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235863" conceptname="Spinal cord injury">spinal cord injury</span>), psychogenic (17%), or mixed (24%) etiologies. Sixty-three percent, 74%, and 82% of the patients on 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg of VIAGRA, respectively, reported an improvement in their erections, compared to 24% on placebo. In the titration studies (n=644) (with most patients eventually receiving 100 mg), results were similar.</p>

<p>The patients in studies had varying degrees of ED. One-third to one-half of the subjects in these studies reported successful intercourse at least once during a 4-week, treatment-free run-in period.</p>
<p>In many of the studies, of both fixed dose and titration designs, daily diaries were kept by patients. In these studies, involving about 1600 patients, analyses of patient diaries showed no effect of VIAGRA on rates of attempted intercourse (about 2 per week), but there was clear treatment-related improvement in sexual function: per patient weekly success rates averaged 1.3 on 50–100 mg of VIAGRA vs 0.4 on placebo; similarly, group mean success rates (total successes divided by total attempts) were about 66% on VIAGRA vs about 20% on placebo.</p>
<p>During 3 to 6 months of double-blind treatment or longer-term (1 year), open-label studies, few patients withdrew from active treatment for any reason, including lack of effectiveness. At the end of the long-term study, 88% of patients reported that VIAGRA improved their erections.</p>
<p>Men with untreated ED had relatively low baseline scores for all aspects of sexual function measured (again using a 5-point scale) in the IIEF. VIAGRA improved these aspects of sexual function: frequency, firmness and maintenance of erections; frequency of orgasm; frequency and level of desire; frequency, satisfaction and enjoyment of intercourse; and overall relationship satisfaction.</p>
<p>One randomized, double-blind, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study included only patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">erectile dysfunction</span> attributed to complications of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus (n=268). As in the other titration studies, patients were started on 50 mg and allowed to adjust the dose up to 100 mg or down to 25 mg of VIAGRA; all patients, however, were receiving 50 mg or 100 mg at the end of the study. There were highly statistically significant improvements on the two principal IIEF questions (frequency of successful penetration during sexual activity and maintenance of erections after penetration) on VIAGRA compared to placebo. On a global improvement question, 57% of VIAGRA patients reported improved erections versus 10% on placebo. Diary data indicated that on VIAGRA, 48% of intercourse attempts were successful versus 12% on placebo. </p>
<p>One randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, flexible-dose (up to 100 mg) study of patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">erectile dysfunction</span> resulting from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235863" conceptname="Spinal cord injury">spinal cord injury</span> (n=178) was conducted. The changes from baseline in scoring on the two end point questions (frequency of successful penetration during sexual activity and maintenance of erections after penetration) were highly statistically significantly in favor of VIAGRA. On a global improvement question, 83% of patients reported improved erections on VIAGRA versus 12% on placebo. Diary data indicated that on VIAGRA, 59% of attempts at sexual intercourse were successful compared to 13% on placebo.</p>
<p>Across all trials, VIAGRA improved the erections of 43% of radical prostatectomy patients compared to 15% on placebo.</p>
<p>Subgroup analyses of responses to a global improvement question in patients with psychogenic etiology in two fixed-dose studies (total n=179) and two titration studies (total n=149) showed 84% of VIAGRA patients reported improvement in erections compared with 26% of placebo. The changes from baseline in scoring on the two end point questions (frequency of successful penetration during sexual activity and maintenance of erections after penetration) were highly statistically significantly in favor of VIAGRA<span class="Bold">.</span> Diary data in two of the studies (n=178) showed rates of successful intercourse per attempt of 70% for VIAGRA and 29% for placebo. </p>
<p>A review of population subgroups demonstrated efficacy regardless of baseline severity, etiology, race and age. VIAGRA was effective in a broad range of ED patients, including those with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317576" conceptname="Coronary arteriosclerosis">coronary artery disease</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, other cardiac disease, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321052" conceptname="Peripheral vascular disease">peripheral vascular disease</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), radical prostatectomy, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235863" conceptname="Spinal cord injury">spinal cord injury</span>, and in patients taking antidepressants/antipsychotics and antihypertensives/diuretics.</p>
<p>Analysis of the safety database showed no apparent difference in the side effect profile in patients taking VIAGRA with and without antihypertensive medication. This analysis was performed retrospectively, and was not powered to detect any pre-specified difference in adverse reactions.</p>

<h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Consistent with its known effects on the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Clin-Pharm">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span>), VIAGRA was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates, and its administration to patients who are using organic nitrates, either regularly and/or intermittently, in any form is therefore contraindicated.</p>
<p>After patients have taken VIAGRA, it is unknown when nitrates, if necessary, can be safely administered. Based on the pharmacokinetic profile of a single 100 mg oral dose given to healthy normal volunteers, the plasma levels of sildenafil at 24 hours post dose are approximately 2 ng/mL (compared to peak plasma levels of approximately 440 ng/mL) (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ClinPharm-PharmKinAndMeta">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</a></span>). In the following patients: age &gt;65, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> (e.g., cirrhosis), severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (e.g., creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min), and concomitant use of potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (erythromycin), plasma levels of sildenafil at 24 hours post dose have been found to be 3 to 8 times higher than those seen in healthy volunteers. Although plasma levels of sildenafil at 24 hours post dose are much lower than at peak concentration, it is unknown whether nitrates can be safely coadministered at this time point.</p>
<p>VIAGRA is contraindicated in patients with a known <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> to any component of the tablet.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34071-1">

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First">There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">erectile dysfunction</span>, including VIAGRA, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status.</p>
<p>VIAGRA has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg), (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ClinPharm-PharmDyn">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacodynamics</a></span>). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing VIAGRA, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity.</p>
<p>Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including VIAGRA – those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4189343" conceptname="Aortic valve stenosis">aortic stenosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4124693" conceptname="Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy">idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis</span>) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure.</p>
<p>There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of VIAGRA in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution.</p>
<ul>
<li>Patients who have suffered a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, or life-threatening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span> within the last 6 months;</li>
<li>Patients with resting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> (BP &lt;90/50) or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> (BP &gt;170/110);</li>

<p>Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315586" conceptname="Priapism">priapism</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4213599" conceptname="Painful penile erection">painful erections</span> greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of VIAGRA. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315586" conceptname="Priapism">priapism</span> is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result.</p>
<p>The concomitant administration of the protease inhibitor ritonavir substantially increases serum concentrations of sildenafil (<span class="Bold">11-fold increase in AUC</span>). If VIAGRA is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of sildenafil are limited. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="374034" conceptname="Visual disturbance">Visual disturbances</span> occurred more commonly at higher levels of sildenafil exposure.

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34072-9">
<a name="section-6.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">The evaluation of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">erectile dysfunction</span> should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment.</p>
<p>Before prescribing VIAGRA, it is important to note the following:</p>
<p>Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including VIAGRA, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood pressure lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly (see <a href="#Prec-DrgInt">Drug Interactions</a>) leading to symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> (e.g. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">lightheadedness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">fainting</span>). </p>
<p>Consideration should be given to the following:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-</dt>
<dd>Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4311860" conceptname="Hemodynamic instability">hemodynamic instability</span> on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors.</dd>
<dt>-</dt>
<dd>In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest dose.</dd>
<dt>-</dt>
<dd>In those patients already taking an optimized dose of a PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. Stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor.</dd>
<dt>-</dt>
<dd>Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436375" conceptname="Hypovolemia">volume depletion</span> and other anti-hypertensive drugs.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Viagra has systemic vasodilatory properties and may augment the blood pressure lowering effect of other anti-hypertensive medications.</p>
<p>Patients on multiple antihypertensive medications were included in the pivotal clinical trials for VIAGRA. In a separate drug interaction study, when amlodipine, 5 mg or 10 mg, and VIAGRA, 100 mg were orally administered concomitantly to hypertensive patients mean additional blood pressure reduction of 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic were noted (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Prec-DrgInt">Drug Interactions</a></span>).</p>
<p>The safety of VIAGRA is unknown in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> disorders and patients with active <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4027663" conceptname="Peptic ulcer">peptic ulceration</span>.</p>
<p>VIAGRA should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012171" conceptname="Fibrosis">fibrosis</span> or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315586" conceptname="Priapism">priapism</span> (such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="22281" conceptname="Hb SS disease">sickle cell anemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437233" conceptname="Multiple myeloma">multiple myeloma</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315497" conceptname="Subacute leukemia">leukemia</span>).</p>
<p>The safety and efficacy of combinations of VIAGRA with other treatments for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">erectile dysfunction</span> have not been studied. Therefore, the use of such combinations is not recommended.</p>
<p>In humans, VIAGRA has no effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4219104" conceptname="Bleeding time">bleeding time</span> when taken alone or with aspirin. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies with human platelets indicate that sildenafil potentiates the antiaggregatory effect of sodium nitroprusside (a nitric oxide donor). The combination of heparin and VIAGRA had an additive effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4219104" conceptname="Bleeding time">bleeding time</span> in the anesthetized rabbit, but this interaction has not been studied in humans.</p>

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Physicians should discuss with patients the contraindication of VIAGRA with regular and/or intermittent use of organic nitrates.</p>
<p>Physicians should advise patients of the potential for VIAGRA to augment the blood pressure lowering effect of alpha-blockers and anti-hypertensive medications.  Concomitant administration of VIAGRA and an alpha-blocker may lead to symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> in some patients.  Therefore, when VIAGRA is co-administered with alpha-blockers, patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating VIAGRA treatment and VIAGRA should be initiated at the lowest dose.</p>
<p>Physicians should discuss with patients the potential cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Patients who experience symptoms (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321318" conceptname="Angina pectoris">angina pectoris</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>) upon initiation of sexual activity should be advised to refrain from further activity and should discuss the episode with their physician.</p>
<p>Physicians should advise patients to stop use of all PDE5 inhibitors, including VIAGRA, and seek medical attention in the event of a sudden <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377551" conceptname="Blind hypertensive eye">loss of vision</span> in one or both eyes.  Such an event may be a sign of non-arteritic anterior <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373487" conceptname="Ischemic optic neuropathy">ischemic optic neuropathy</span> (NAION), a cause of decreased vision including permanent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377551" conceptname="Blind hypertensive eye">loss of vision</span>, that has been reported rarely post-marketing in temporal association with the use of all PDE5 inhibitors. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or to other factors. Physicians should also discuss with patients the increased risk of NAION in individuals who have already experienced NAION in one eye, including whether such individuals could be adversely affected by use of vasodilators, such as PDE5 inhibitors (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#AdvReact-PostMarketExp-SpecSenses">POST-MARKETING EXPERIENCE/Special Senses</a></span>).</p>
<p>Physicians should advise patients to stop taking PDE5 inhibitors, including VIAGRA, and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing.  These events, which may be accompanied by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377575" conceptname="Tinnitus">tinnitus</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, have been reported in temporal association to the intake of PDE5 inhibitors, including VIAGRA. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or to other factors (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Adv-React">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a>, <a href="#CT">CLINICAL TRIALS</a> and <a href="#Post">POST-MARKETING EXPERIENCE</a></span>).</p>
<p>Physicians should warn patients that prolonged erections greater than 4 hours and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315586" conceptname="Priapism">priapism</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4213599" conceptname="Painful penile erection">painful erections</span> greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of VIAGRA. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315586" conceptname="Priapism">priapism</span> is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency may result.</p>
<p>Physicians should inform patients not to take VIAGRA with other PDE5 inhibitors including REVATIO. Sildenafil is also marketed as REVATIO for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013643" conceptname="Pulmonary arterial hypertension">pulmonary arterial hypertension</span>. The safety and efficacy of VIAGRA with other PDE5 inhibitors, including REVATIO, have not been studied.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>

<h3>Effects of Other Drugs on VIAGRA</h3>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-6.3.1.1"></a><p></p>
<h4>In vitro studies</h4>
<p class="First">Sildenafil metabolism is principally mediated by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 3A4 (major route) and 2C9 (minor route). Therefore, inhibitors of these isoenzymes may reduce sildenafil clearance and inducers of these isoenzymes may increase sildenafil clearance.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-6.3.1.2"></a><p></p>
<h4>In vivo studies</h4>
<p class="First">Cimetidine (800 mg), a nonspecific CYP inhibitor, caused a 56% increase in plasma sildenafil concentrations when coadministered with VIAGRA (50 mg) to healthy volunteers.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-6.3.1.3"></a><p></p>
<h4></h4>
<p class="First">When a single 100 mg dose of VIAGRA was administered with erythromycin, a specific CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid for 5 days), there was a 182% increase in sildenafil systemic exposure (AUC).  In addition, in a study performed in healthy male volunteers, coadministration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, also a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (1200 mg tid) with VIAGRA (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in sildenafil C<span class="Sub">max</span> and a 210% increase in sildenafil AUC. VIAGRA had no effect on saquinavir pharmacokinetics. Stronger CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or itraconazole would be expected to have still greater effects, and population data from patients in clinical trials did indicate a reduction in sildenafil clearance when it was coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, or cimetidine) (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Dos-Admin">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>
<p>In another study in healthy male volunteers, coadministration with the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is a highly potent P450 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid) with VIAGRA (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) increase in sildenafil C<span class="Sub">max</span> and a 1000% (11-fold) increase in sildenafil plasma AUC. At 24 hours the plasma levels of sildenafil were still approximately 200 ng/mL, compared to approximately 5 ng/mL when sildenafil was dosed alone. This is consistent with ritonavir's marked effects on a broad range of P450 substrates. VIAGRA had no effect on ritonavir pharmacokinetics (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Dos-Admin">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>
<p>Although the interaction between other protease inhibitors and sildenafil has not been studied, their concomitant use is expected to increase sildenafil levels.</p>
<p>In a study of healthy male volunteers, co-administration of sildenafil at steady state (80 mg t.i.d.) with endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly of cytochrome P450 2C19) at steady state (125 mg b.i.d.) resulted in a 63% decrease of sildenafil AUC and a 55% decrease in sildenafil C<span class="Sub">max</span>. Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, is expected to cause greater decreases in plasma levels of sildenafil. </p>
<p>Single doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) did not affect the bioavailability of VIAGRA.</p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic data from patients in clinical trials showed no effect on sildenafil pharmacokinetics of CYP2C9 inhibitors (such as tolbutamide, warfarin), CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), thiazide and related diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. The AUC of the active metabolite, N-desmethyl sildenafil, was increased 62% by loop and potassium-sparing diuretics and 102% by nonspecific beta-blockers. These effects on the metabolite are not expected to be of clinical consequence.</p>

<h3>Effects of VIAGRA on Other Drugs</h3>

<h4>In vitro studies</h4>
<p class="First">Sildenafil is a weak inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 isoforms 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4 (IC50 &gt;150 µM). Given sildenafil peak plasma concentrations of approximately 1 µM after recommended doses, it is unlikely that VIAGRA will alter the clearance of substrates of these isoenzymes.</p>

<h4>In vivo studies</h4>
<p class="First">Three double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, two-way crossover studies were conducted to assess the interaction of VIAGRA with doxazosin, an alpha-adrenergic blocking agent.</p>

<p class="First">In the first study, a single oral dose of VIAGRA 100 mg or matching placebo was administered in a 2-period crossover design to 4 generally healthy males with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198803" conceptname="Benign prostatic hyperplasia">benign prostatic hyperplasia</span> (BPH).  Following at least 14 consecutive daily doses of doxazosin, VIAGRA 100 mg or matching placebo was administered simultaneously with doxazosin.  Following a review of the data from these first 4 subjects (details provided below), the VIAGRA dose was reduced to 25 mg.  Thereafter, 17 subjects were treated with VIAGRA 25 mg or matching placebo in combination with doxazosin 4 mg (15 subjects) or doxazosin 8mg (2 subjects).  The mean subject age was 66.5 years.  </p>

<p>Blood pressure was measured immediately pre-dose and at 15, 30, 45 minutes, and 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6 and 8 hours after VIAGRA or matching placebo.  Outliers were defined as subjects with a standing systolic blood pressure of &lt;85 mmHg or a decrease from baseline in standing systolic blood pressure of &gt;30 mmHg at one or more timepoints.  There were no subjects treated with VIAGRA 25 mg who had a standing SBP &lt; 85mmHg.  There were three subjects with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic BP &gt;30mmHg following VIAGRA 25 mg, one subject with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic BP &gt; 30 mmHg following placebo and two subjects with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic BP &gt; 30 mmHg following both VIAGRA and placebo.  No severe adverse events potentially related to blood pressure effects were reported in this group.</p>

<p>Blood pressure was measured after administration of VIAGRA at the same times as those specified for the first doxazosin study.  There were two subjects who had a standing SBP of &lt; 85 mmHg.  In these two subjects, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> was reported as a moderately severe adverse event, beginning at approximately 1 hour after administration of VIAGRA 50 mg and resolving after approximately 7.5 hours.  There was one subject with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic BP &gt;30mmHg following VIAGRA 50 mg and one subject with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic BP &gt; 30 mmHg following both VIAGRA 50 mg and placebo. There were no severe adverse events potentially related to blood pressure and no episodes of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">syncope</span> reported in this study.</p>
<p>In the third study, a single oral dose of VIAGRA 100 mg or matching placebo was administered in a 3-period crossover design to 20 generally healthy males with BPH.  In dose period 1, subjects were administered open-label doxazosin and a single dose of VIAGRA 50 mg simultaneously, after at least 14 consecutive days of doxazosin.  If a subject did not successfully complete this first dosing period, he was discontinued from the study.  Subjects who had successfully completed the previous doxazosin interaction study (using VIAGRA 50 mg), including no significant hemodynamic adverse events, were allowed to skip dose period 1.  Treatment with doxazosin continued for at least 7 days after dose period 1.  Thereafter, VIAGRA 100mg or matching placebo was administered simultaneously with doxazosin 4 mg (14 subjects) or doxazosin 8 mg (6 subjects) in standard crossover fashion.  The mean subject age in this study was 66.4 years.</p>
<p>Twenty-five subjects were screened.  Two were discontinued after study period 1: one failed to meet pre-dose screening qualifications and the other experienced symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> as a moderately severe adverse event 30 minutes after dosing with open-label VIAGRA 50 mg.

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Sildenafil was not carcinogenic when administered to rats for 24 months at a dose resulting in total systemic drug exposure (AUCs) for unbound sildenafil and its major metabolite of 29- and 42-times, for male and female rats, respectively, the exposures observed in human males given the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 100 mg. Sildenafil was not carcinogenic when administered to mice for 18–21 months at dosages up to the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of 10 mg/kg/day, approximately 0.6 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p>

<h2>CLINICAL TRIALS</h2>
<p class="First">VIAGRA was administered to over 3700 patients (aged 19–87 years) during pre-marketing clinical trials worldwide. Over 550 patients were treated for longer than one year.</p>
<p>In placebo-controlled clinical studies, the discontinuation rate due to  adverse events for VIAGRA (2.5%) was not significantly different from placebo (2.3%). The adverse events were generally transient and mild to moderate in nature.</p>
<p>In trials of all designs, adverse events reported by patients receiving VIAGRA were generally similar. In fixed-dose studies, the incidence of some adverse events increased with dose. The nature of the adverse events in flexible-dose studies, which more closely reflect the recommended dosage regimen, was similar to that for fixed-dose studies.</p>
<p>When VIAGRA was taken as recommended (on an as-needed basis) in flexible-dose, placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse events were reported: </p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">In studies with healthy volunteers of single doses up to 800 mg, adverse events were similar to those seen at lower doses but incidence rates and severities were increased.</p>
<p>In cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. Renal dialysis is not expected to accelerate clearance as sildenafil is highly bound to plasma proteins and it is not eliminated in the urine.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34068-7">
<a name="Dos-Admin"></a><a name="section-9"></a><p></p>
<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">For most patients, the recommended dose is 50 mg taken, as needed, approximately 1 hour before sexual activity. However, VIAGRA may be taken anywhere from 4 hours to 0.5 hour before sexual activity. Based on effectiveness and toleration, the dose may be increased to a maximum recommended dose of 100 mg or decreased to 25 mg. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day.</p>
<p>The following factors are associated with increased plasma levels of sildenafil: age &gt;65 (40% increase in AUC), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> (e.g., cirrhosis, 80%), severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min, 100%), and concomitant use of potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors [ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin (182%), saquinavir (210%)]. Since higher plasma levels may increase both the efficacy and incidence of adverse events, a starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in these patients.</p>
<p>Ritonavir greatly increased the systemic level of sildenafil in a study of healthy, non-HIV infected volunteers (11-fold increase in AUC, see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Prec-DrgInt">Drug Interactions</a></span>.) Based on these pharmacokinetic data, it is recommended not to exceed a maximum single dose of 25 mg of VIAGRA in a 48 hour period. </p>
<p>VIAGRA was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates and its administration in patients who use nitric oxide donors or nitrates in any form is therefore contraindicated.</p>
<p>When VIAGRA is co-administered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating VIAGRA treatment and VIAGRA should be initiated at the lowest dose (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Prec-DrgInt">Drug Interactions</a></span>).</p>

<p>VIAGRA is a pill used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">erectile dysfunction</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">impotence</span>) in men. It can help many men who have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">erectile dysfunction</span> get and keep an erection when they become sexually excited (stimulated).</p>
<p>You will not get an erection just by taking this medicine. VIAGRA helps a man with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">erectile dysfunction</span> get an erection only when he is sexually excited.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">• HOW SEX AFFECTS THE BODY</span></p>
<p>When a man is sexually excited, the penis rapidly fills with more blood than usual. The penis then expands and hardens. This is called an erection. After the man is done having sex, this extra blood flows out of the penis back into the body. The erection goes away. If an erection lasts for a long time (more than 6 hours), it can permanently damage your penis. You should call a doctor immediately if you ever have a prolonged erection that lasts more than 4 hours.</p>
<p>Some conditions and medicines interfere with this natural erection process. The penis cannot fill with enough blood. The man cannot have an erection. This is called <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">erectile dysfunction</span> if it becomes a frequent problem.</p>
<p>During sex, your heart works harder. Therefore sexual activity may not be advisable for people who have heart problems. Before you start any treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">erectile dysfunction</span>, ask your doctor if your heart is healthy enough to handle the extra <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span> of having sex. If you have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77670" conceptname="Chest pain">chest pains</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> during sex, stop having sex and immediately tell your doctor you have had this problem. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">• HOW VIAGRA WORKS</span></p>
<p>VIAGRA enables many men with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">erectile dysfunction</span> to respond to sexual stimulation. When a man is sexually excited, VIAGRA helps the penis fill with enough blood to cause an erection. After sex is over, the erection goes away. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">• VIAGRA IS NOT FOR EVERYONE</span></p>
<p>As noted above (<span class="Italics">How Sex Affects the Body</span>), ask your doctor if your heart is healthy enough for sexual activity.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">If you take any medicines that contain nitrates – either regularly or as needed – you should never take VIAGRA.</span> If you take VIAGRA with any nitrate medicine or recreational drug containing nitrates, your blood pressure could suddenly drop to an unsafe level. You could get dizzy, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">faint</span>, or even have a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>. Nitrates are found in many prescription medicines that are used to treat angina (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77670" conceptname="Chest pain">chest pain</span> due to heart disease) such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>nitroglycerin (sprays, ointments, skin patches or pastes, and tablets that are swallowed or dissolved in the mouth)</li>
<li>isosorbide mononitrate and isosorbide dinitrate (tablets that are swallowed, chewed, or dissolved in the mouth)</li>
</ul>
<p>Nitrates are also found in recreational drugs such as amyl nitrate or nitrite ("poppers"). If you are not sure if any of your medicines contain nitrates, or if you do not understand what nitrates are, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p>VIAGRA is only for patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">erectile dysfunction</span>. VIAGRA is not for newborns, children, or women. Do not let anyone else take your VIAGRA. VIAGRA must be used only under a doctor's supervision.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">• WHAT VIAGRA DOES NOT DO</span></p>
<ul>
<li>VIAGRA does not cure <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">erectile dysfunction</span>. It is a treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">erectile dysfunction</span>.</li>
<li>VIAGRA does not protect you or your partner from getting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440647" conceptname="Sexually transmitted infectious disease">sexually transmitted diseases</span>, including HIV—the virus that causes AIDS.</li>
<li>VIAGRA is not a hormone or an aphrodisiac.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Bold">• WHAT TO TELL YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE YOU BEGIN VIAGRA</span></p>
<p>Only your doctor can decide if VIAGRA is right for you. VIAGRA can cause mild, temporary lowering of your blood pressure. You will need to have a thorough medical exam to diagnose your <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">erectile dysfunction</span> and to find out if you can safely take VIAGRA alone or with your other medicines. Your doctor should determine if your heart is healthy enough to handle the extra <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span> of having sex.</p>
<p>Be sure to tell your doctor if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>have ever had any heart problems (e.g., angina, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77670" conceptname="Chest pain">chest pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, irregular heart beats, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</span> or narrowing of the aortic valve)</li>
<li>have ever had a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span></li>
<li>have low or high blood pressure</li>
<li>have ever had severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377551" conceptname="Blind hypertensive eye">vision loss</span></li>
<li>have a rare inherited eye disease called <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103381" conceptname="Retinitis pigmentosa">retinitis pigmentosa</span></li>
<li>have ever had any kidney problems</li>
<li>have ever had any liver problems</li>
<li>have ever had any blood problems, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="22281" conceptname="Hb SS disease">sickle cell anemia</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315497" conceptname="Subacute leukemia">leukemia</span></li>
<li>are allergic to sildenafil or any of the other ingredients of VIAGRA tablets</li>
<li>have a deformed penis, Peyronie's disease, or ever had an erection that lasted more than 4 hours</li>
<li>have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4265600" conceptname="Gastric ulcer">stomach ulcers</span> or any types of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> problems </li>
<li>are taking any other medicines</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Bold">• VIAGRA AND OTHER MEDICINES</span></p>
<p>Some medicines can change the way VIAGRA works. Tell your doctor about <span class="Bold">any medicines</span> you are taking. Do not start or stop taking any medicines before checking with your doctor or pharmacist. This includes prescription and nonprescription medicines or remedies: </p>
<ul>
<li>Remember, VIAGRA should never be used with medicines that contain nitrates (see <span class="Italics">VIAGRA Is Not for Everyone</span>). </li>
<li>If you are taking medicines called alpha-blockers for the treatment of high blood pressure or prostate problems, your blood pressure could suddenly drop.  You could get dizzy or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">faint</span>. </li>
<li>If you are taking a protease inhibitor, your dose may be adjusted (please see <span class="Italics">Finding the Right Dose for You</span>). </li>
<li>VIAGRA should not be used with any other medical treatments that cause erections. These treatments include pills, medicines that are injected or inserted into the penis, implants or vacuum pumps.</li>
<li>VIAGRA contains sildenafil, which is the same medicine found in another drug called REVATIO. REVATIO is used to treat a rare disease called <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4013643" conceptname="Pulmonary arterial hypertension">pulmonary arterial hypertension</span>. VIAGRA should not be used with REVATIO.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Bold">• FINDING THE RIGHT DOSE FOR YOU</span></p>
<p>VIAGRA comes in different doses (25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg). If you do not get the results you expect, talk with your doctor. You and your doctor can determine the dose that works best for you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not take more VIAGRA than your doctor prescribes.</li>
<li>If you think you need a larger dose of VIAGRA, check with your doctor.</li>
<li>VIAGRA should not be taken more than once a day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor may prescribe a lower dose of VIAGRA in certain circumstances. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are older than age 65, or have serious liver or kidney problems, your doctor may start you at the lowest dose (25 mg) of VIAGRA. </li>
<li>If you are taking protease inhibitors, such as for the treatment of HIV, your doctor may recommend a 25 mg dose and may limit you to a maximum single dose of 25 mg of VIAGRA in a 48 hour period.</li>
<li>If you have prostate problems or high blood pressure for which you take 	medicines called alpha blockers, your doctor may start you on a lower dose of VIAGRA. </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Bold">• HOW TO TAKE VIAGRA</span></p>
<p>Take VIAGRA about one hour before you plan to have sex. Beginning in about 30 minutes and for up to 4 hours, VIAGRA can help you get an erection if you are sexually excited. If you take VIAGRA after a high-fat meal (such as a cheeseburger and french fries), the medicine may take a little longer to start working. VIAGRA can help you get an erection when you are sexually excited. You will not get an erection just by taking the pill.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">• POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS</span></p>
<p>Like all medicines, VIAGRA can cause some side effects. These effects are usually mild to moderate and usually don't last longer than a few hours. Some of these side effects are more likely to occur with higher doses. The most common side effects of VIAGRA are <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318566" conceptname="Flushing">flushing</span> of the face, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012224" conceptname="Upset stomach">upset stomach</span>. Less common side effects that may occur are temporary changes in color vision (such as trouble telling the difference between blue and green objects or having a blue color tinge to them), eyes being more sensitive to light, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079185" conceptname="Hazy vision">blurred vision</span>. </p>
<p>In rare instances, men taking PDE5 inhibitors (oral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">erectile dysfunction</span> medicines, including VIAGRA) reported a sudden decrease or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377551" conceptname="Blind hypertensive eye">loss of vision</span> in one or both eyes.  It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to these medicines, to other factors such as high blood pressure or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, or to a combination of these. If you experience sudden decrease or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377551" conceptname="Blind hypertensive eye">loss of vision</span>, stop taking PDE5 inhibitors, including VIAGRA, and call a doctor right away. </p>
<p>In rare instances, men have reported an erection that lasts many hours. You should call a doctor immediately if you ever have an erection that lasts more than 4 hours. If not treated right away, permanent damage to your penis could occur (see <span class="Italics">How Sex Affects the Body</span>). </p>
<p>Sudden loss or decrease in hearing, sometimes with ringing in the ears and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, has been rarely reported in people taking PDE5 inhibitors, including VIAGRA. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the PDE5 inhibitors, to other diseases or medications, to other factors, or to a combination of factors. If you experience these symptoms, stop taking VIAGRA and contact a doctor right away.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">Heart attack</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, irregular heart beats, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> have been reported rarely in men taking VIAGRA. Most, but not all, of these men had heart problems before taking this medicine. It is not possible to determine whether these events were directly related to VIAGRA.</p>
<p>VIAGRA may cause other side effects besides those listed on this sheet. If you want more information or develop any side effects or symptoms you are concerned about, call your doctor.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">• ACCIDENTAL <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">OVERDOSE</span></span></p>
<p>In case of accidental <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, call your doctor right away.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">• STORING VIAGRA</span></p>
<p>Keep VIAGRA out of the reach of children. Keep VIAGRA in its original container. Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15–30°C (59–86°F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature].</p>
