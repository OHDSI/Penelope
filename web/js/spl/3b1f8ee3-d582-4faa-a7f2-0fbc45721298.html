<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
            EPIVIR-HBV is a brand name for lamivudine, a synthetic nucleoside analogue with activity against <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> B virus (HBV) and HIV. Lamivudine was initially developed for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439727" conceptname="Human immunodeficiency virus infection">HIV infection</span> as EPIVIR. Please see the complete prescribing information for EPIVIR Tablets and Oral Solution for additional information. The chemical name of lamivudine is (2R,cis)-4-amino-1-(2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-oxathiolan-5-yl)-(1H)-pyrimidin-2-one. Lamivudine is the (-)enantiomer of a dideoxy analogue of cytidine. Lamivudine has also been referred to as (-)23It has a molecular formula of C8H11N3O3S and a molecular weight of 229.3. It has the following structural formula:<br><div class="Figure"><img alt="MM1" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=3b1f8ee3-d582-4faa-a7f2-0fbc45721298&amp;name=MM1.jpg"></div>
<br><br><br><br><br>Lamivudine is a white to off-white crystalline solid with a solubility of approximately 70 mg/mL in water at 20<br>EPIVIR-HBV Tablets are for oral administration.

<h1>MICROBIOLOGY</h1>
<span class="Bold">
              Mechanism of Action:<br></span>Lamivudine is a synthetic nucleoside analogue. Intracellularly, lamivudine is phosphorylated to its active 5metabolite, lamivudine triphosphate, 3TC-TP. Incorporation of the monophosphate form into viral DNA by HBV reverse transcriptase results in DNA chain termination. 3TC-TP also inhibits the RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). 3TC-TP is a weak inhibitor of mammalianandpolymerases.<br><br><span class="Bold">
              Antiviral Activity:<br></span>Activity of lamivudine against HBV in cell culture was assessed in HBV DNA-transfected 2.2.15 cells, HB611 cells, and infected human primary hepatocytes. EC50 values (the concentration of drug needed to reduce the level of extracellular HBV DNA by 50%) varied from 0.01(2.3 ng/mL) to 5.6(1.3 mcg/mL) depending upon the duration of exposure of cells to lamivudine, the cell model system, and the protocol used. See the EPIVIR package insert for information regarding activity of lamivudine against HIV.<br><br><span class="Bold">
              Resistance:<br></span>Lamivudine-resistant isolates were identified in patients with virologic breakthrough, defined when using solution hybridization assay as the detection of HBV DNA in serum on 2 or more occasions after failing to detect HBV DNA on 2 or more occasions and defined when using PCR assay as a &gt;1 log10 (10-fold) increase in serum HBV DNA from nadir during treatment in a patient who had an initial virologic response.<br>Lamivudine-resistant HBV isolates develop M204V/I substitutions in the YMDD motif of the catalytic domain of the viral reverse transcriptase. M204V/I substitutions are frequently accompanied by other substitutions (V173L, L180M) which enhance the level of lamivudine resistance or act as compensatory mutations improving replication efficiency. Other substitutions detected in lamivudine-resistant HBV isolates include L80I and A181T.<br>In 4 controlled clinical trials in adults with HBeAg-positive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200763" conceptname="Chronic hepatitis">chronic hepatitis</span> B virus <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> (CHB), YMDD-mutant HBV was detected in 81 of 335 patients receiving lamivudine 100 mg once daily for 52 weeks. The prevalence of YMDD substitutions was less than 10% in each of these trials for patients studied at 24 weeks and increased to an average of 24% (range in 4 studies: 16% to 32%) at 52 weeks. In limited data from a long-term follow-up trial in patients who continued 100 mg/day lamivudine after one of these studies, YMDD substitutions further increased from 18% (10 of 57) at 1 year to 41% (20 of 49), 53% (27 of 51), and 69% (31 of 45) after 2, 3, and 4 years of treatment, respectively. Over the 5-year treatment period, the proportion of patients who developed YMDD-mutant HBV at any time was 69% (40 of 58).<br>In a controlled trial in pediatric patients, YMDD-mutant HBV was detected in 31 of 166 (19%) patients receiving lamivudine for 52 weeks. For a subgroup who remained on lamivudine therapy in a follow-up study, YMDD mutations increased from 24% (29 of 121) at 12 months to 59% (68 of 115) at 24 months and 64% (66 of 103) at 36 months of lamivudine treatment.<br>In a controlled study, treatment-naive patients with HBeAg-positive CHB were treated with lamivudine or lamivudine plus adefovir dipivoxil combination therapy. Following 104 weeks of therapy, YMDD-mutant HBV was detected in 7 of 40 (18%) patients receiving combination therapy compared with 15 of 35 (43%) patients receiving lamivudine-only therapy. In another controlled study, combination therapy was evaluated in adult patients with HBeAg-positive CHB who had YMDD-mutant HBV and diminished clinical and virologic response to lamivudine. Following 52 weeks of lamivudine plus adefovir dipivoxil combination therapy (n = 46) or lamivudine-only therapy (n = 49), YMDD-mutant HBV was detected less frequently in patients receiving combination therapy, 62% vs 96%.<br>A published study suggested that the rates of lamivudine resistance in patients treated for HBeAg-negative CHB appear to be more variable (0% to 27% at 1 year and 10% to 56% at 2 years).<br><br><span class="Bold">
              Cross-Resistance:<br></span>HBV: HBV containing lamivudine resistance-associated substitutions (rtL180M, rtM204I, rtM204V, rtL180M + rtM204V, rtV173L + rtL180M + rtM204V) retain susceptibility to adefovir dipivoxil but have reduced susceptibility to entecavir (30 fold) and telbivudine (&gt;100 fold). The lamivudine resistance-associated substitution rtA181T results in diminished response to adefovir and telbivudine. Similarly, HBV with entecavir resistance-associated substitutions (I169T/M250V and T184G/S202I) have &gt;1,000-fold reductions in susceptibility to lamivudine.<br>HIV: In studies of HIV-1-infected patients who received lamivudine monotherapy or combination therapy with lamivudine plus zidovudine for at least 12 weeks, HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility in cell culture to lamivudine were detected in most patients (see WARNINGS).<br><br>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<span class="Bold">
              Pharmacokinetics in Adults:<br></span>The pharmacokinetic properties of lamivudine have been studied as single and multiple oral doses ranging from 5 to 600 mg per day administered to HBV-infected patients.<br>The pharmacokinetic properties of lamivudine have also been studied in asymptomatic, HIV-infected adult patients after administration of single intravenous (IV) doses ranging from 0.25 to 8 mg/kg, as well as single and multiple (twice-daily regimen) oral doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg.<br>Absorption and Bioavailability: Lamivudine was rapidly absorbed after oral administration in HBV-infected patients and in healthy subjects. Following single oral doses of 100 mg, the peak serum lamivudine concentration (Cmax) in HBV-infected patients (steady state) and healthy subjects (single dose) was 1.280.56 mcg/mL and 1.050.32 mcg/mL (meanSD), respectively, which occurred between 0.5 and 2 hours after administration. The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC[0-24 hr]) following 100 mg lamivudine oral single and repeated daily doses to steady state was 4.31.4 (meanSD) and 4.71.7 mcghr/mL, respectively. The relative bioavailability of the tablet and solution were then demonstrated in healthy subjects. Although the solution demonstrated a slightly higher peak serum concentration (Cmax), there was no significant difference in systemic exposure (AUCbetween the solution and the tablet. Therefore, the solution and the tablet may be used interchangeably.<br>After oral administration of lamivudine once daily to HBV-infected adults, the AUC and Cmax increased in proportion to dose over the range from 5 mg to 600 mg once daily.<br>Lamivudine was rapidly absorbed after oral administration in HIV-infected patients. Absolute bioavailability in 12 adult patients was 86%16% (meanSD) for the 150-mg tablet and 87%13% for the 10-mg/mL oral solution.<br>Distribution: The apparent volume of distribution after IV administration of lamivudine to 20 asymptomatic HIV-infected patients was 1.30.4 L/kg, suggesting that lamivudine distributes into extravascular spaces. Volume of distribution was independent of dose and did not correlate with body weight.<br>Binding of lamivudine to human plasma proteins is low (&lt;36%) and independent of dose. In vitro studies showed that over the concentration range of 0.1 to 100 mcg/mL, the amount of lamivudine associated with erythrocytes ranged from 53% to 57% and was independent of concentration.<br>Metabolism: Metabolism of lamivudine is a minor route of elimination. In man, the only known metabolite of lamivudine is the trans-sulfoxide metabolite. In 9 healthy subjects receiving 300 mg of lamivudine as single oral doses, a total of 4.2% (range 1.5% to 7.5%) of the dose was excreted as the trans-sulfoxide metabolite in the urine, the majority of which was excreted in the first 12 hours.<br>Serum concentrations of the trans-sulfoxide metabolite have not been determined.<br>Elimination: The majority of lamivudine is eliminated unchanged in urine by active organic cationic secretion. In 9 healthy subjects given a single 300-mg oral dose of lamivudine, renal clearance was 199.756.9 mL/min (meanSD). In 20 HIV-infected patients given a single IV dose, renal clearance was 280.475.2 mL/min (meanSD), representing 71%16% (meanSD) of total clearance of lamivudine.<br>In most single-dose studies in HIV- or HBV-infected patients or healthy subjects with serum sampling for 24 hours after dosing, the observed mean elimination half-life (tranged from 5 to 7 hours. In HIV-infected patients, total clearance was 398.569.1 mL/min (meanSD). Oral clearance and elimination half-life were independent of dose and body weight over an oral dosing range from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg.<br><br><span class="Bold">

Patients aged 2 to 12 years were randomized to receive lamivudine 0.35 mg/kg twice daily, 3 mg/kg once daily, 1.5 mg/kg twice daily, or 4 mg/kg twice daily. Patients aged 13 to 17 years received lamivudine 100 mg once daily. Lamivudine was rapidly absorbed (Tmax 0.5 to 1 hour). In general, both Cmax and exposure (AUC) showed dose proportionality in the dosing range studied. Weight-corrected oral clearance was highest at age 2 and declined from 2 to 12 years, where values were then similar to those seen in adults. A dose of 3 mg/kg given once daily produced a steady-state lamivudine AUC (mean 5,953 nghr/mL1,562 SD) similar to that associated with a dose of 100 mg/day in adults.<br>Gender: There are no significant gender differences in lamivudine pharmacokinetics.<br>Race: There are no significant racial differences in lamivudine pharmacokinetics.<br><br><span class="Bold">

These mutations can be detected by a research assay and have been associated with reduced susceptibility to lamivudine in vitro. Lamivudine-treated patients (adult and pediatric) with YMDD-mutant HBV at 52 weeks showed diminished treatment responses in comparison to lamivudine-treated patients without evidence of YMDD mutations, including lower rates of HBeAg seroconversion and HBeAg loss (no greater than placebo recipients), more frequent return of positive HBV DNA by solution-hybridization or branched-chain DNA assay, and more frequent ALT elevations. In the controlled trials, when patients developed YMDD-mutant HBV, they had a rise in HBV DNA and ALT from their own previous on-treatment levels. Progression of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> B, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>, has been reported in some patients with YMDD-mutant HBV, including patients from the liver transplant setting and from other clinical trials.

<h1>DRUG INTERACTIONS</h1>
            Lamivudine is predominantly eliminated in the urine by active organic cationic secretion. The possibility of interactions with other drugs administered concurrently should be considered, particularly when their main route of elimination is active renal secretion via the organic cationic transport system (e.g., trimethoprim).<br>TMP 160 mg/SMX 800 mg once daily has been shown to increase lamivudine exposure (AUC) by 44% (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). No change in dose of either drug is recommended. There is no information regarding the effect on lamivudine pharmacokinetics of higher doses of TMP/SMX such as those used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438350" conceptname="Pneumocystosis">Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia</span>. No data are available regarding interactions with other drugs that have renal clearance mechanisms similar to that of lamivudine.<br>Lamivudine and zalcitabine may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another. Therefore, use of lamivudine in combination with zalcitabine is not recommended.<br><br>

<h1>PREGNANCY</h1>
            Pregnancy Category C. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at orally administered doses up to 4,000 mg/kg/day and 1,000 mg/kg/day, respectively, producing plasma levels up to approximately 60 times that for the adult HBV dose. No evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> due to lamivudine was observed. Evidence of early embryolethality was seen in the rabbit at exposure levels similar to those observed in humans, but there was no indication of this effect in the rat at exposures up to 60 times that in humans. Studies in pregnant rats and rabbits showed that lamivudine is transferred to the fetus through the placenta. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproductive toxicity studies are not always predictive of human response, lamivudine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.<br>Lamivudine has not been shown to affect the transmission of HBV from mother to infant, and appropriate infant immunizations should be used to prevent neonatal acquisition of HBV.<br>Pregnancy Registry: To monitor maternal-fetal outcomes of pregnant women exposed to lamivudine, a Pregnancy Registry has been established.

<h1>NURSING MOTHERS</h1>
            A study in lactating rats administered 45 mg/kg of lamivudine showed that lamivudine concentrations in milk were slightly greater than those in plasma. Lamivudine is also excreted in human milk. Samples of breast milk obtained from 20 mothers receiving lamivudine monotherapy (300 mg twice daily) or combination therapy (150 mg lamivudine twice daily and 300 mg zidovudine twice daily) had measurable concentrations of lamivudine.<br>Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, mothers should be instructed not to breastfeed if they are receiving lamivudine.<br><br>

<h1>GERIATRIC USE</h1>
            Clinical studies of EPIVIR-HBV did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. In particular, because lamivudine is substantially excreted by the kidney and elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, renal function should be monitored and dosage adjustments should be made accordingly (see PRECAUTIONS: Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Impaired Renal Function</span> and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).<br><br>

<h1>SPL PATIENT PACKAGE INSERT</h1>
            EPIVIR-HBV(lamivudine) Tablets<br>EPIVIR-HBV(lamivudine) Oral Solution<br>Please read this information before you start taking EPIVIR-HBV (pronounced EP-i-veer h-b-v). Re-read it each time you get your prescription, in case some information has changed. This information does not take the place of careful discussions with your doctor when you start this medication and at checkups. Stay under a doctor's care when you take EPIVIR-HBV and do not change or stop treatment without first talking with your doctor.<br>What is EPIVIR-HBV?<br>EPIVIR-HBV is the brand name of a product that contains lamivudine, a drug used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200763" conceptname="Chronic hepatitis">chronic hepatitis</span> B in patients with actively growing virus and liver <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">Hepatitis</span> B can cause damage to cells in the liver. Eventually, this can <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4050007" conceptname="Scar">scar</span> the liver.<br>The lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV can reduce the ability of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> B virus to multiply and infect new liver cells. It may help to lower the amount of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> B virus in your body. EPIVIR-HBV contains a lower dose of lamivudine than the dose in EPIVIRCOMBIVIREPZICOMand TRIZIVIR<br>Why should I consider HIV testing before starting treatment with EPIVIR-HBV?<br>Your doctor or healthcare provider should offer you counseling and testing for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439727" conceptname="Human immunodeficiency virus infection">HIV infection</span> (sometimes called the AIDS virus) before treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> B is started with EPIVIR-HBV, and periodically during treatment. EPIVIR-HBV Tablets and EPIVIR-HBV Oral Solution contain a lower dose of the medicine than other lamivudine-containing drugs, such as EPIVIR, COMBIVIR, EPZICOM, and TRIZIVIR which are used to treat HIV. Treatment with EPIVIR-HBV in HIV-infected patients may cause the HIV virus to be less treatable with lamivudine and some other drugs.<br>If I am HIV-positive, can I take EPIVIR-HBV?<br>People who have both <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200763" conceptname="Chronic hepatitis">chronic hepatitis</span> B and HIV should not take EPIVIR-HBV. EPIVIR-HBV Tablets and EPIVIR-HBV Oral Solution contain a lower dose of the same drug (lamivudine) as EPIVIR Tablets, EPIVIR Oral Solution, COMBIVIR Tablets, EPZICOM Tablets, and TRIZIVIR Tablets. If you have both <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> B and HIV, make sure that your doctor or healthcare provider is aware that you have both <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span>. If you are prescribed lamivudine as part of your combination treatment for HIV, you should use only the products and doses that are intended for treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439727" conceptname="Human immunodeficiency virus infection">HIV infection</span>, because the lower dose of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV could cause the HIV virus to be less responsive to treatment. If you are planning to change your HIV treatment to a regimen that does not include EPIVIR, COMBIVIR, EPZICOM, or TRIZIVIR, you should first discuss this change with your doctor or healthcare provider.<br>Does EPIVIR-HBV cure <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> B <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>?<br>EPIVIR-HBV is not a cure for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> B. In studies comparing EPIVIR-HBV with placebo (an inactive sugar pill) for 1 year, more people treated with EPIVIR-HBV had reductions in liver <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span>. It is not known whether EPIVIR-HBV will reduce the risk of getting liver cancer or cirrhosis that may be caused by the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> B virus.<br>In studies, some patients developed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> B viruses that are resistant to EPIVIR-HBV. These patients generally had less benefit from treatment with EPIVIR-HBV. Some patients have had worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> after resistant virus appears. The long-term importance of a resistant virus is not known.<br>What happens if I stop taking EPIVIR-HBV?<br>After stopping treatment with EPIVIR-HBV, some patients have had symptoms or blood tests showing that their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> has gotten worse. Therefore, your doctor should check your health, which may include blood tests, for at least several months after stopping treatment with EPIVIR-HBV. Tell your doctor right away about any new or unusual symptoms that you notice after stopping treatment.<br>Who should not take EPIVIR-HBV?<br>You should not take EPIVIR-HBV if you have or may have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439727" conceptname="Human immunodeficiency virus infection">HIV infection</span> (sometimes called the AIDS virus). EPIVIR-HBV does not contain an appropriate dose of lamivudine for treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439727" conceptname="Human immunodeficiency virus infection">HIV infection</span>, and using EPIVIR-HBV could cause the HIV virus to become less treatable with lamivudine and some other drugs.<br>You should not take EPIVIR-HBV if you are also taking EPIVIR, COMBIVIR, EPZICOM, or TRIZIVIR. These drugs all contain lamivudine.<br>You should not take EPIVIR-HBV if you have had an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergic reaction</span> to lamivudine.<br>EPIVIR-HBV has not been studied in children less than 2 years old.<br>Can pregnant women and nursing mothers take EPIVIR-HBV?<br>There are no studies of EPIVIR-HBV in pregnant women. If you are pregnant or if you become pregnant while taking EPIVIR-HBV, notify your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.<br>EPIVIR-HBV has not been shown to prevent the spread of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> B virus from mother to infant.<br>It is not known whether lamivudine is passed to the infant in breast milk. If there is lamivudine in the breast milk, this could cause side effects in nursing infants. Mothers should not breastfeed while taking EPIVIR-HBV or other forms of lamivudine.<br>How should I take EPIVIR-HBV?<br>Your doctor will tell you how much EPIVIR-HBV to take. The usual dose is 1 EPIVIR-HBV Tablet orally (by mouth) once a day. Your doctor may prescribe a lower dose if you have problems with your kidneys. EPIVIR-HBV may be taken with food or on an empty stomach. To help you remember to take your EPIVIR-HBV as prescribed, you should try to take EPIVIR-HBV at the same time each day. You must not skip doses or stop treatment without first talking with your doctor or healthcare provider. A strawberry-banana-flavored liquid of EPIVIR-HBV is available for patients who need a liquid.<br>If you miss your regular time for taking your dose, but then remember it during that same day, take your missed dose immediately. Then, take your next dose at the regularly scheduled time the following day. Do not take 2 doses of EPIVIR-HBV at once to make up for missing a dose. If you are not sure what to do if you miss taking your medication, check with your doctor or healthcare provider for further instructions.<br>You should talk to your doctor about any changes in your treatment.<br>What are the possible side effects of EPIVIR-HBV?<br><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">Hepatitis</span> B virus sometimes becomes resistant to EPIVIR-HBV during treatment, and some people have had tests showing that their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> was getting worse around the time the virus became resistant. Some people also have worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> after stopping EPIVIR-HBV. You should discuss any change in treatment with your doctor.<br>This list of possible side effects is not complete. Your doctor or pharmacist can discuss with you a more complete list of possible side effects with EPIVIR-HBV. Talk to your doctor right away about any side effects or other unusual symptoms that occur when taking EPIVIR-HBV.<br>Does EPIVIR-HBV reduce the risk of passing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> B to others?<br>No, EPIVIR-HBV has not been shown to reduce the risk of passing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> B to others through sexual contact or exposure to infected blood. EPIVIR-HBV also has not been shown to reduce the risk of a mother passing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> B to her baby.<br>What previous or current medical problems or conditions should I discuss with my doctor or healthcare provider?<br>Talk to your doctor or healthcare provider if:<br><dl class="Disc">
