<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">TEMOVATE E<span class="Sup">®</span> (clobetasol propionate emollient cream) Emollient, 0.05% contains the active compound clobetasol propionate, a synthetic corticosteroid, for topical dermatologic use. Clobetasol, an analog of prednisolone, has a high degree of glucocorticoid activity and a slight degree of mineralocorticoid activity.</p>
<p>Chemically, clobetasol propionate is (11β,16β)-21-chloro-9-fluoro-11-hydroxy-16-methyl-17-(1-oxopropoxy)-pregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione, and it has the following structural formula:</p>

</div>
<p>Clobetasol propionate has the molecular formula C<span class="Sub">25</span>H<span class="Sub">32</span>ClFO<span class="Sub">5</span> and a molecular weight of 467. It is a white to cream-colored crystalline powder insoluble in water.</p>
<p>TEMOVATE E<span class="Sup">®</span> Emollient contains: clobetasol propionate 0.5 mg/g in an emollient base of cetostearyl alcohol, isopropyl myristate, propylene glycol, cetomacrogol 1000, dimethicone 360, citric acid, sodium citrate, purified water, and imidurea as a preservative.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Like other topical corticosteroids, clobetasol propionate has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A<span class="Sub">2</span> inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A<span class="Sub">2</span>.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics:</span> The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusive dressing with hydrocortisone for up to 24 hours has not been demonstrated to increase penetration; however, occlusion of hydrocortisone for 96 hours markedly enhances penetration. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">Inflammation</span> and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption.</p>
<p>Studies performed with TEMOVATE E<span class="Sup">®</span> Emollient indicate that it is in the super-high range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids.</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">TEMOVATE E<span class="Sup">®</span> Emollient is a super-high potency corticosteroid formulation indicated for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. Treatment beyond 2 consecutive weeks is not recommended, and the total dosage should not exceed 50 g/week because of the potential for the drug to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Use in children under 12 years of age is not recommended.</p>
<p>In the treatment of moderate to severe plaque-type <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span>, TEMOVATE E<span class="Sup">®</span> Emollient applied to 5% to 10% of body surface area can be used up to 4 consecutive weeks. The total dosage should not exceed 50 g/week. When dosing for more than 2 weeks, any additional benefits of extending treatment should be weighed against the risk of HPA suppression. Treatment beyond 4 consecutive weeks is not recommended. Patients should be instructed to use TEMOVATE E<span class="Sup">®</span> Emollient for the minimum amount of time necessary to achieve the desired results (See <a href="#s7">PRECAUTIONS</a> and <a href="#s5">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</a>).  Use in pediatric patients under 16 years of age has not been studied.</p>

<h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h1>
<p class="First">TEMOVATE E<span class="Sup">®</span> (clobetasol propionate emollient cream) Emollient, 0.05% is contraindicated in those patients with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> to any of the components of the preparation.</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34072-9">
<a name="s8"></a><a name="section-6.1"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">General: Clobetasol propionate is a highly potent topical corticosteroid that has been shown to suppress the HPA axis at doses as low as 2 g/day.</span></p>
<p>Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible HPA axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal from treatment. Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span>, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on therapy.</p>
<p>Patients applying a topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. This may be done by using the ACTH stimulation, A.M. plasma cortisol, and urinary free cortisol tests. Patients receiving super-potent corticosteroids should not be treated for more than 2 weeks at a time, and only small areas should be treated at any one time due to the increased risk of HPA suppression.</p>
<p>In a controlled clinical trial involving patients with moderate to severe plaque-type <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span>, TEMOVATE E<span class="Sup">®</span> Emollient applied to 5% to 10% of body surface area, resulted in additional benefits in the treatment of patients for 4 consecutive weeks. In this trial, there were no clobetasol-treated patients with clinically significant decreases in morning cortisol levels after 4 weeks of treatment; however, morning cortisol levels may not identify patients with adrenal dysfunction. Therefore, the additional benefits of extending treatment beyond 2 weeks should be weighed against the potential for HPA suppression. Therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved. Treatment beyond 4 consecutive weeks is not recommended.</p>
<p>If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency may occur that require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. For information on systemic supplementation, see prescribing information for those products.</p>
<p>Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> ratios (see <a href="#s14">PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use</a>).  The use of TEMOVATE E<span class="Sup">®</span> Emollient for 4 consecutive weeks has not been studied in pediatric patients under 16 years of age.</p>
<p>TEMOVATE E<span class="Sup">®</span> Emollient contains the excipient imidurea which releases traces of formaldehyde as a breakdown product. Formaldehyde may cause allergic sensitization or irritation upon contact with the skin.</p>
<p>If irritation develops, TEMOVATE E<span class="Sup">®</span> Emollient should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134438" conceptname="Contact dermatitis">Allergic contact dermatitis</span> with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing a <span class="Italics">failure to heal</span> rather than noting a clinical exacerbation as with most topical products not containing corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing.</p>
<p>If concomitant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201093" conceptname="Infection of skin AND/OR subcutaneous tissue">skin infections</span> are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of TEMOVATE E<span class="Sup">®</span> Emollient should be discontinued until the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> has been adequately controlled.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">TEMOVATE E<span class="Sup">®</span> Emollient should not be used in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="136773" conceptname="Rosacea">rosacea</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135032" conceptname="Dermatitis due to substances taken internally">perioral dermatitis</span>, and should not be used on the face, groin, or axillae.</span></p>
