<h2>Mechanism of Action:</h2>
<p class="First">Lidocaine HCl stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses thereby effecting local anesthetic action.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="i4i_section_id_2842a35d-2c47-4850-a743-024c70930cad"></a><a name="section-2.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Hemodynamics:</h2>
<p class="First">Excessive blood levels may cause changes in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span>, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. With central neural blockade these changes may be attributable to block of autonomic fibers, a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system, and/or the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when present. The net effect is normally a modest <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> when the recommended dosages are not exceeded.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">

<h2>Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism:</h2>
<p class="First">Information derived from diverse formulations, concentrations and usages reveals that lidocaine HCl is completely absorbed following parenteral administration, its rate of absorption depending, for example, upon various factors such as the site of administration and the presence or absence of a vasoconstrictor agent. Except for intravascular administration, the highest blood levels are obtained following intercostal nerve block and the lowest after subcutaneous administration.</p>
<p>The plasma binding of lidocaine HCl is dependent on drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 µg of free base per mL 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein.</p>
<p>Lidocaine HCl crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion.</p>
<p>Lidocaine HCl is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine HCl. Approximately 90% of lidocaine HCl administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2,6- dimethylaniline.</p>
<p>The elimination half-life of lidocaine HCl following an intravenous bolus injection is typically 1.5 to 2.0 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine HCl is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine HCl kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites.</p>
<p>Factors such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidosis</span> and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine HCl required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6.0 µg free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18-21 µg/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity.</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Xylocaine (lidocaine HCl) Injections are indicated for production of local or regional anesthesia by infiltration techniques such as percutaneous injection and intravenous regional anesthesia by peripheral nerve block techniques such as brachial plexus and intercostal and by central neural techniques such as lumbar and caudal epidural blocks, when the accepted procedures for these techniques as described in standard textbooks are observed.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First">XYLOCAINE INJECTIONS FOR INFILTRATION AND NERVE BLOCK SHOULD BE EMPLOYED ONLY BY CLINICIANS WHO ARE WELL VERSED IN DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF DOSE-RELATED TOXICITY AND OTHER ACUTE EMERGENCIES THAT MIGHT ARISE FROM THE BLOCK TO BE EMPLOYED AND THEN ONLY AFTER ENSURING THE <span class="Italics">IMMEDIATE</span> AVAILABILITY OF OXYGEN, OTHER RESUSCITATIVE DRUGS, CARDIOPULMONARY EQUIPMENT AND THE PERSONNEL NEEDED FOR PROPER MANAGEMENT OF TOXIC REACTIONS AND RELATED EMERGENCIES. (See also <a href="#i4i_adverse_effects_id_fd89d68e-b20d-4faf-99ef-59124e38c543">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a> and <a href="#i4i_precautions_id_85e0d12f-7565-455a-bf22-552ea303b7a1">PRECAUTIONS</a>.) DELAY IN PROPER MANAGEMENT OF DOSE-RELATED TOXICITY, UNDERVENTILATION FROM ANY CAUSE AND/OR ALTERED SENSITIVITY MAY LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">ACIDOSIS</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">CARDIAC ARREST</span> AND, POSSIBLY, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">DEATH</span>.</p>
<p>To avoid intravascular injection, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span> should be performed before the local anesthetic solution is injected. The needle must be repositioned until no return of blood can be elicited by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span>. Note, however, that the absence of blood in the syringe does not guarantee that intravascular injection has been avoided.</p>
<p>Local anesthetic solutions containing antimicrobial preservatives, (eg, methylparaben) should not be used for epidural or spinal anesthesia because the safety of these agents has not been established with regard to intrathecal injection, either intentional or accidental.</p>
<p>Xylocaine with epinephrine solutions contain sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatic</span> episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatic</span> than in non-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthmatic</span> people.</p>

<a name="i4i_precautions_general_id_748f2a9b-bce0-4c69-a9f0-ed8e27cd3485"></a><a name="section-6.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>General:</h2>
<p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of lidocaine HCl depend on proper dosage, correct technique, adequate precautions, and readiness for emergencies. Standard textbooks should be consulted for specific techniques and precautions for various regional anesthetic procedures.</p>
<p>Resuscitative equipment, oxygen, and other resuscitative drugs should be available for immediate use. (See <a href="#i4i_warnings_id_65bc0ae2-8473-4aea-a85d-29c87f35dd1d">WARNINGS</a> and <a href="#i4i_adverse_effects_id_fd89d68e-b20d-4faf-99ef-59124e38c543">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a>.) The lowest dosage that results in effective anesthesia should be used to avoid high plasma levels and serious adverse effects. Syringe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspirations</span> should also be performed before and during each supplemental injection when using indwelling catheter techniques. During the administration of epidural anesthesia, it is recommended that a test dose be administered initially and that the patient be monitored for central nervous system toxicity and cardiovascular toxicity, as well as for signs of unintended intrathecal administration, before proceeding. When clinical conditions permit, consideration should be given to employing local anesthetic solutions that contain epinephrine for the test dose because circulatory changes compatible with epinephrine may also serve as a warning sign of unintended intravascular injection. An intravascular injection is still possible even if <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspirations</span> for blood are negative. Repeated doses of lidocaine HCl may cause significant increases in blood levels with each repeated dose because of slow accumulation of the drug or its metabolites. Tolerance to elevated blood levels varies with the status of the patient. Debilitated, elderly patients, acutely ill patients, and children should be given reduced doses commensurate with their age and physical condition. Lidocaine HCl should also be used with caution in patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316135" conceptname="Atrioventricular block">heart block</span>.</p>
<p>Lumbar and caudal epidural anesthesia should be used with extreme caution in persons with the following conditions: existing neurological disease, spinal deformities, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="132797" conceptname="Sepsis">septicemia</span>, and severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>.</p>
<p>Local anesthetic solutions containing a vasoconstrictor should be used cautiously and in carefully circumscribed quantities in areas of the body supplied by end arteries or having otherwise compromised blood supply. Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321052" conceptname="Peripheral vascular disease">peripheral vascular disease</span> and those with hypertensive vascular disease may exhibit exaggerated vasoconstrictor response. Ischemic injury or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280654" conceptname="Necrosis">necrosis</span> may result. Preparations containing a vasoconstrictor should be used with caution in patients during or following the administration of potent general anesthetic agents, since <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmias</span> may occur under such conditions.</p>
<p>Careful and constant monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory (adequacy of ventilation) vital signs and the patient’s state of consciousness should be accomplished after each local anesthetic injection. It should be kept in mind at such times that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">restlessness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377575" conceptname="Tinnitus">tinnitus</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079185" conceptname="Hazy vision">blurred vision</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremors</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> may be early warning signs of central nervous system toxicity.</p>
<p>Since amide-type local anesthetics are metabolized by the liver, Xylocaine Injection should be used with caution in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span>. Patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span>, because of their inability to metabolize local anesthetics normally, are at greater risk of developing toxic plasma concentrations. Xylocaine Injection should also be used with caution in patients with impaired cardiovascular function since they may be less able to compensate for functional changes associated with the prolongation of A-V conduction produced by these drugs. </p>
<p>Many drugs used during the conduct of anesthesia are considered potential triggering agents for familial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440285" conceptname="Malignant hyperthermia">malignant hyperthermia</span>. Since it is not known whether amide-type local anesthetics may trigger this reaction and since the need for supplemental general anesthesia cannot be predicted in advance, it is suggested that a standard protocol for the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440285" conceptname="Malignant hyperthermia">malignant hyperthermia</span> should be available. Early unexplained signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317376" conceptname="Tachypnea">tachypnea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4354255" conceptname="Labile blood pressure">labile blood pressure</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span> may precede temperature elevation. Successful outcome is dependent on early diagnosis, prompt discontinuance of the suspect triggering agent(s) and institution of treatment, including oxygen therapy, indicated supportive measures and dantrolene (consult dantrolene sodium intravenous package insert before using).</p>
<p>Proper tourniquet technique, as described in publications and standard text-books, is essential in the performance of intravenous regional anesthesia. Solutions containing epinephrine or other vasoconstrictors should not be used for this technique.</p>
<p>Lidocaine HCl should be used with caution in persons with known drug sensitivities. Patients allergic to para-aminobenzoic acid derivatives (procaine, tetracaine, benzocaine, etc.) have not shown cross-sensitivity to lidocaine HCl.</p>

<h2>Use in the Head and Neck Area:</h2>
<p class="First">Small doses of local anesthetics injected into the head and neck area, including retrobulbar, dental and stellate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="72712" conceptname="Synovial cyst">ganglion</span> blocks, may produce adverse reactions similar to systemic toxicity seen with unintentional intravascular injections of larger doses. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">Confusion</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317109" conceptname="Respiratory arrest">respiratory arrest</span>, and cardiovascular stimulation or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> have been reported. These reactions may be due to intra-arterial injection of the local anesthetic with retrograde flow to the cerebral circulation. Patients receiving these blocks should have their circulation and respiration monitored and be constantly observed. Resuscitative equipment and personnel for treating adverse reactions should be immediately available. Dosage recommendations should not be exceeded.

<p class="First">Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at doses up to 6.6 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus caused by lidocaine HCl. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. General consideration should be given to this fact before administering lidocaine HCl to women of childbearing potential, especially during early pregnancy when maximum organogenesis takes place.</p>

<h2>Labor and Delivery:</h2>
<p class="First">Local anesthetics rapidly cross the placenta and when used for epidural, paracervical, pudendal or caudal block anesthesia, can cause varying degrees of maternal, fetal and neonatal toxicity. (See <a href="#i4i_section_id_cc90a14c-4a2d-4216-afc0-ed7792b9d01f">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics</a>.) The potential for toxicity depends upon the procedure performed, the type and amount of drug used, and the technique of drug administration. Adverse reactions in the parturient, fetus and neonate involve alterations of the central nervous system, peripheral vascular tone and cardiac function.</p>
<p>Maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> has resulted from regional anesthesia. Local anesthetics produce vasodilation by blocking sympathetic nerves. Elevating the patient’s legs and positioning her on her left side will help prevent decreases in blood pressure.</p>
<p>The fetal heart rate also should be monitored continuously, and electronic fetal monitoring is highly advisable.</p>
<p>Epidural, spinal, paracervical, or pudendal anesthesia may alter the forces of parturition through changes in uterine contractility or maternal expulsive efforts. In one study, paracervical block anesthesia was associated with a decrease in the mean duration of first stage labor and facilitation of cervical dilation. However, spinal and epidural anesthesia have also been reported to prolong the second stage of labor by removing the parturient’s reflex urge to bear down or by interfering with motor function. The use of obstetrical anesthesia may increase the need for forceps assistance.</p>

<h2>Neurologic:</h2>
<p class="First">The incidences of adverse reactions associated with the use of local anesthetics may be related to the total dose of local anesthetic administered and are also dependent upon the particular drug used, the route of administration and the physical status of the patient. In a prospective review of 10,440 patients who received lidocaine for spinal anesthesia, the incidences of adverse reactions were reported to be about 3 percent each for positional <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headaches</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134736" conceptname="Backache">backache</span>; 2 percent for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4190045" conceptname="Rigor">shivering</span>; and less than 1 percent each for peripheral nerve symptoms, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, respiratory inadequacy and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373474" conceptname="Diplopia">double vision</span>. Many of these observations may be related to local anesthetic techniques, with or without a contribution from the local anesthetic.</p>
<p>In the practice of caudal or lumbar epidural block, occasional unintentional penetration of the subarachnoid space by the catheter may occur. Subsequent adverse effects may depend partially on the amount of drug administered subdurally. These may include spinal block of varying magnitude (including total spinal block), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> secondary to spinal block, loss of bladder and bowel control, and loss of perineal sensation and sexual function.

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Acute emergencies from local anesthetics are generally related to high plasma levels encountered during therapeutic use of local anesthetics or to unintended subarachnoid injection of local anesthetic solution (see <a href="#i4i_adverse_effects_id_fd89d68e-b20d-4faf-99ef-59124e38c543">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a>, <a href="#i4i_warnings_id_65bc0ae2-8473-4aea-a85d-29c87f35dd1d">WARNINGS</a>, and <a href="#i4i_precautions_id_85e0d12f-7565-455a-bf22-552ea303b7a1">PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Management of Local Anesthetic Emergencies:</span> The first consideration is prevention, best accomplished by careful and constant monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory vital signs and the patient’s state of consciousness after each local anesthetic injection. At the first sign of change, oxygen should be administered.</p>
<p>The first step in the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>, as well as underventilation or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span> due to unintended subarachnoid injection of drug solution, consists of immediate attention to the maintenance of a patent airway and assisted or controlled ventilation with oxygen and a delivery system capable of permitting immediate positive airway pressure by mask. Immediately after the institution of these ventilatory measures, the adequacy of the circulation should be evaluated, keeping in mind that drugs used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> sometimes depress the circulation when administered intravenously. Should <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> persist despite adequate respiratory support, and if the status of the circulation permits, small increments of an ultra-short acting barbiturate (such as thiopental or thiamylal) or a benzodiazepine (such as diazepam) may be administered intravenously. The clinician should be familiar, prior to the use of local anesthetics, with these anticonvulsant drugs. Supportive treatment of circulatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> may require administration of intravenous fluids and, when appropriate, a vasopressor as directed by the clinical situation (eg, ephedrine).</p>
<p>If not treated immediately, both <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> and cardiovascular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> can result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span>. Underventilation or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span> due to unintentional subarachnoid injection of local anesthetic solution may produce these same signs and also lead to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span> if ventilatory support is not instituted. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span> should occur, standard cardiopulmonary resuscitative measures should be instituted.</p>
<p>Endotracheal intubation, employing drugs and techniques familiar to the clinician, may be indicated, after initial administration of oxygen by mask, if difficulty is encountered in the maintenance of a patent airway or if prolonged ventilatory support (assisted or controlled) is indicated. Dialysis is of negligible value in the treatment of acute overdosage with lidocaine HCl.</p>
<p>The oral LD<span class="Sub">50</span> of lidocaine HCl in non-fasted female rats is 459 (346-773) mg/kg (as the salt) and 214 (159-324) mg/kg (as the salt) in fasted female rats.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Table 1 (Recommended Dosages) summarizes the recommended volumes and concentrations of Xylocaine Injection for various types of anesthetic procedures. The dosages suggested in this table are for normal healthy adults and refer to the use of epinephrine-free solutions. When larger volumes are required, only solutions containing epinephrine should be used except in those cases where vasopressor drugs may be contraindicated.</p>
<p>These recommended doses serve only as a guide to the amount of anesthetic required for most routine procedures. The actual volumes and concentrations to be used depend on a number of factors such as type and extent of surgical procedure, depth of anesthesia and degree of muscular relaxation required, duration of anesthesia required, and the physical condition of the patient. In all cases the lowest concentration and smallest dose that will produce the desired result should be given. Dosages should be reduced for children and for the elderly and debilitated patients and patients with cardiac and/or liver disease.</p>
<p>The onset of anesthesia, the duration of anesthesia and the degree of muscular relaxation are proportional to the volume and concentration (ie, total dose) of local anesthetic used. Thus, an increase in volume and concentration of Xylocaine Injection will decrease the onset of anesthesia, prolong the duration of anesthesia, provide a greater degree of muscular relaxation and increase the segmental spread of anesthesia. However, increasing the volume and concentration of Xylocaine Injection may result in a more profound <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314171" conceptname="Low blood pressure reading">fall in blood pressure</span> when used in epidural anesthesia. Although the incidence of side effects with lidocaine HCl is quite low, caution should be exercised when employing large volumes and concentrations, since the incidence of side effects is directly proportional to the total dose of local anesthetic agent injected.</p>
<p>For intravenous regional anesthesia, only the 50 mL single dose vial containing Xylocaine (lidocaine HCl) 0.5% Injection should be used.</p>

<p>Although these solutions are intended specifically for epidural anesthesia, they may also be used for infiltration and peripheral nerve block, provided they are employed as single dose units. These solutions contain no bacteriostatic agent.</p>
<p>In epidural anesthesia, the dosage varies with the number of dermatomes to be anesthetized (generally 2-3 mL of the indicated concentration per dermatome).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Caudal and Lumbar Epidural Block:</span> As a precaution against the adverse experience sometimes observed following unintentional penetration of the subarachnoid space, a test dose such as 2-3 mL of 1.5% lidocaine HCl should be administered at least 5 minutes prior to injecting the total volume required for a lumbar or caudal epidural block. The test dose should be repeated if the patient is moved in a manner that may have displaced the catheter. Epinephrine, if contained in the test dose, (10-15 µg have been suggested), may serve as a warning of unintentional intravascular injection. If injected into a blood vessel, this amount of epinephrine is likely to produce a transient “epinephrine response? within 45 seconds, consisting of an increase in heart rate and systolic blood pressure, circumoral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260836" conceptname="Blanching of skin">pallor</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315078" conceptname="Palpitations">palpitations</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436817" conceptname="Feeling nervous">nervousness</span> in the unsedated patient. The sedated patient may exhibit only a pulse rate increase of 20 or more beats per minute for 15 or more seconds. Patients on beta blockers may not manifest changes in heart rate, but blood pressure monitoring can detect an evanescent rise in systolic blood pressure. Adequate time should be allowed for onset of anesthesia after administration of each test dose. The rapid injection of a large volume of Xylocaine Injection through the catheter should be avoided, and, when feasible, fractional doses should be administered. </p>
<p>In the event of the known injection of a large volume of local anesthetic solution into the subarachnoid space, after suitable resuscitation and if the catheter is in place, consider attempting the recovery of drug by draining a moderate amount of cerebrospinal fluid (such as 10 mL) through the epidural catheter.</p>

<h2>Adults</h2>
<p class="First">For normal healthy adults, the individual maximum recommended dose of lidocaine HCl with epinephrine should not exceed 7 mg/kg (3.5 mg/lb) of body weight, and in general it is recommended that the maximum total dose not exceed 500 mg. When used without epinephrine the maximum individual dose should not exceed 4.5 mg/kg (2 mg/lb) of body weight, and in general it is recommended that the maximum total dose does not exceed 300 mg. For continuous epidural or caudal anesthesia, the maximum recommended dosage should not be administered at intervals of less than 90 minutes. When continuous lumbar or caudal epidural anesthesia is used for non-obstetrical procedures, more drug may be administered if required to produce adequate anesthesia. </p>
<p>The maximum recommended dose per 90 minute period of lidocaine hydrochloride for paracervical block in obstetrical patients and non-obstetrical patients is 200 mg total. One half of the total dose is usually administered to each side. Inject slowly, five minutes between sides. (See also discussion of paracervical block in<a href="#i4i_precautions_id_85e0d12f-7565-455a-bf22-552ea303b7a1"> PRECAUTIONS</a>.)</p>
<p>For intravenous regional anesthesia, the dose administered should not exceed 4 mg/kg in adults.</p>

<h2>Children</h2>
<p class="First">It is difficult to recommend a maximum dose of any drug for children, since this varies as a function of age and weight. For children over 3 years of age who have a normal lean body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> and normal body development, the maximum dose is determined by the child’s age and weight. For example, in a child of 5 years weighing 50 lbs the dose of lidocaine HCl should not exceed 75-100 mg (1.5-2 mg/lb). The use of even more dilute solutions (ie, 0.25-0.5%) and total dosages not to exceed 3 mg/kg (1.4 mg/lb) are recommended for induction of intravenous regional anesthesia in children.</p>
<p>In order to guard against systemic toxicity, the lowest effective concentration and lowest effective dose should be used at all times. In some cases it will be necessary to dilute available concentrations with 0.9% sodium chloride injection in order to obtain the required final concentration.</p>
<p>NOTE: Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever the solution and container permit. The Injection is not to be used if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate.</p>

<h1>STERILIZATION, STORAGE AND TECHNICAL PROCEDURES</h1>
<p class="First">Disinfecting agents containing heavy metals, which cause release of respective ions (mercury, zinc, copper, etc.) should not be used for skin or mucous membrane disinfection as they have been related to incidents of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span>. When chemical disinfection of multi-dose vials is desired, either isopropyl alcohol (91%) or ethyl alcohol (70%) is recommended. Many commercially available brands of rubbing alcohol, as well as solutions of ethyl alcohol not of USP grade, contain denaturants which are injurious to rubber and therefore are not to be used.</p>
