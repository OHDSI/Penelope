<h3>Moexipril Hydrochloride</h3>
<p class="First">Moexipril hydrochloride is a prodrug for moexiprilat, which inhibits ACE in humans and animals. The mechanism through which moexiprilat lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily inhibition of ACE activity. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of the inactive decapeptide angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent peripheral vasoconstrictor that also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex and provides negative feedback on renin secretion. ACE is identical to kininase II, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin, an endothelium-dependent vasodilator. Moexiprilat is about 1000 times as potent as moexipril in inhibiting ACE and kininase II. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased angiotensin II formation, leading to decreased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137788" conceptname="Vascular constriction">vasoconstriction</span>, increased plasma renin activity, and decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter results in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span> and natriuresis and a small increase in serum potassium concentration (mean increases of about 0.25 mEq/L were seen when moexipril was used alone).</p>
<p>Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of moexipril remains to be elucidated. Although the principal mechanism of moexipril in blood pressure reduction is believed to be through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, ACE inhibitors have some effect on blood pressure even in apparent low-renin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>. As is the case with other ACE inhibitors, however, the antihypertensive effect of moexipril is smaller in black patients, a predominantly low-renin population, than in nonblack hypertensive patients. Although moexipril monotherapy is less effective in blacks than in nonblacks, the efficacy of combination therapy appears to be independent of race.</p>

<h3>Hydrochlorothiazide</h3>
<p class="First">Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic and antihypertensive. Thiazides affect the distal renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin, so coadministration of an ACE inhibitor tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown.</p>

<h3>Moexipril-Hydrochlorothiazide</h3>
<p class="First">Following oral administration of moexipril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide, the moexipril peak plasma concentration was reached within 0.8 hour and the peak plasma concentration of moexiprilat occurred 1.6 hours after administration. After reaching the peak plasma level (C<span class="Sub">max</span>), moexiprilat plasma concentrations decreased biphasically. After administration of moexipril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide, renal excretion of unchanged hydrochlorothiazide is about 60% in 24 hours. The pharmacokinetics of moexipril and hydrochlorothiazide after administration of moexipril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide are not different, respectively, from the pharmacokinetics of moexipril and hydrochlorothiazide from immediate-release monotherapy formulations.</p>

<h3>Moexipril Hydrochloride</h3>
<p class="First">Moexipril’s antihypertensive activity is almost entirely due to its deesterified metabolite, moexiprilat. Bioavailability of oral moexipril is about 13% compared to intravenous (I.V.) moexipril (both measuring the metabolite moexiprilat), and is markedly affected by food, which reduces C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC (see <span class="Underline"><a href="#i4i_section_id_53050be2-0f11-4b22-9c3b-541aa2007dbf">Absorption</a></span>). Moexipril should therefore be taken in a fasting state. The time of peak plasma concentration (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) of moexiprilat is about 1 ½ hours and elimination half-life (t<span class="Sub">½</span>) is estimated at 2 to 9 hours in various studies, the variability reflecting a complex elimination pattern that is not simply exponential. Like all ACE inhibitors, moexiprilat has a prolonged terminal elimination phase, presumably reflecting slow release of drug bound to the ACE. Accumulation of moexiprilat with repeated dosing is minimal, about 30%, compatible with a functional elimination t<span class="Sub">½</span> of about 12 hours. Over the dose range of 7.5 to 30 mg, pharmacokinetics are approximately dose proportional.</p>

<h4>Absorption</h4>
<p class="First">Moexipril is incompletely absorbed, with bioavailability as moexiprilat of about 13%. Bioavailability varies with formulation and food intake which reduces C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of moexiprilat by about 70% and 40% respectively after the ingestion of a low-fat breakfast or by 80% and 50% respectively after the ingestion of a high-fat breakfast.</p>

<h4>Distribution</h4>
<p class="First">The clearance (CL) for moexipril is 441 mL/min and for moexiprilat 232 mL/min with a t<span class="Sub">½</span> of 1.3 and 9.8 hours, respectively. Moexiprilat is about 50% protein bound. The volume of distribution of moexiprilat is about 2.8 L/kg.</p>

<h4>Metabolism and Excretion</h4>
<p class="First">Moexipril is relatively rapidly converted to its active metabolite moexiprilat, but persists longer than some other ACE inhibitor prodrugs, such that its t<span class="Sub">½</span> is over one hour and it has a significant AUC. Both moexipril and moexiprilat are converted to diketopiperazine derivatives and unidentified metabolites. After I.V. administration of moexipril, about 40% of the dose appears in urine as moexiprilat, about 26% as moexipril, with small amounts of the metabolites; about 20% of the I.V. dose appears in feces, principally as moexiprilat. After oral administration, only about 7% of the dose appears in urine as moexiprilat, about 1% as moexipril, with about 5% as other metabolites. Fifty-two percent of the dose is recovered in feces as moexiprilat and 1% as moexipril.</p>

<h5>Decreased Renal Function</h5>
<p class="First">The effective elimination t<span class="Sub">½</span> and AUC of both moexipril and moexiprilat are increased with decreasing renal function. There is insufficient information available to characterize this relationship fully, but at creatinine clearances in the range of 10 to 40 mL/min, the t<span class="Sub">½</span> of moexiprilat is increased by a factor of 3 to 4.</p>

<h5>Decreased Hepatic Function</h5>
<p class="First">In patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis given single 15 mg doses of moexipril, the C<span class="Sub">max</span> of moexipril was increased by about 50% and the AUC increased by about 120%, while the C<span class="Sub">max</span> for moexiprilat was decreased by about 50% and the AUC increased by almost 300%.</p>

<h5>Elderly Patients</h5>
<p class="First">In elderly male subjects (65 to 80 years old) with clinically normal renal and hepatic function, the AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of moexiprilat are about 30% greater than in younger subjects (19 to 42 years old).</p>

<h4>Absorption</h4>
<p class="First">After oral administration, 60 to 80% of a single dose of hydrochlorothiazide is absorbed. The reported studies of food effects on hydrochlorothiazide absorption have been inconclusive. The absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is reported to be reduced by 50% in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>.

<h4>Distribution</h4>
<p class="First">The apparent volume of distribution has been observed to vary between 1.5 to 4.2 L/kg. Hydrochlorothiazide accumulates in red blood cells, so that whole blood levels are higher than those measured in plasma. Equilibrium between whole blood levels and plasma levels is reached 4 hours after oral administration. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placental barrier. Hydrochlorothiazide has a protein binding of 21 to 24%.</p>

<h4>Metabolism and Excretion</h4>
<p class="First">Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized. Hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated rapidly by the kidney. More than 60 percent of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. When plasma levels have been followed for at least 24 hours, the plasma half-life has been observed to vary between 5.6 and 14.8 hours. The renal clearance has been observed to vary between 3.1 to 5.5 mL/min/kg.</p>

<h3>Moexipril-Hydrochlorothiazide</h3>
<p class="First">In moexipril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide clinical trials using moexipril doses of 3.75 to 30 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 3.125 to 50 mg, the antihypertensive effects were sustained for at least 24 hours and they increased with increasing dose of either component. The extent of blood pressure reduction seen with moexipril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide was approximately additive as compared to monotherapy of each component. The antihypertensive effects of moexipril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide continue during therapy for up to 24 months. The effectiveness of moexipril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide was not significantly influenced by patient age or gender. Although moexipril monotherapy is less effective in blacks than in nonblacks, the efficacy of moexipril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide appears to be independent of race.</p>
<p>By blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, administration of moexipril tends to reduce the potassium loss associated with hydrochlorothiazide. In moexipril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide controlled clinical trials, the average change in serum potassium was near zero in subjects who received 3.75 mg/6.25 mg or 7.5 mg/12.5 mg, but subjects who received 15 mg/12.5 mg or 15 mg/25 mg experienced a mild decrease in serum potassium, similar to that experienced by subjects who received the same dose of hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy.</p>

<h3>Moexipril Hydrochloride</h3>
<p class="First">Single and multiple doses of 15 mg or more of moexipril give sustained inhibition of plasma ACE activity of 80 to 90%, beginning within 2 hours and lasting 24 hours (80%).</p>
<p>In controlled trials, the peak effects of orally administered moexipril increased with the dose administered over a dose range of 7.5 to 60 mg, given once a day. Antihypertensive effects were first detectable about 1 hour after dosing, with a peak effect between 3 and 6 hours after dosing. Just before dosing (i.e., at trough), the antihypertensive effects were less prominently related to dose and the antihypertensive effect tended to diminish during the 24 hour dosing interval when the drug was administered once a day.</p>
<p>In multiple-dose studies in the dose range of 7.5 to 30 mg once daily, moexipril lowered sitting blood pressure at trough by 4 to 11/3 to 6 mmHg more than placebo, a tendency toward increased response with higher doses. These effects are typical of ACE inhibitors; there are no trials of adequate size comparing moexipril with other antihypertensive agents.</p>
<p>Higher doses of moexipril generally leave a greater fraction of the peak blood pressure effect still present at trough. During dose titration, any decision as to the adequacy of a dosing regimen should be based on trough blood pressure measurements. If diastolic blood pressure control is not adequate at the end of the dosing interval, the dose can be increased or given as a divided (BID) regimen.</p>
<p>During chronic therapy, the antihypertensive effect of any dose of moexipril is generally evident within 2 weeks of treatment, with maximal reduction after 4 weeks. The antihypertensive effects of moexipril have been proven to continue during therapy for up to 24 months.</p>
<p>Moexipril, like other ACE inhibitors, is less effective in decreasing trough blood pressures in blacks than in nonblacks. Placebo-corrected trough group diastolic blood pressure effects in blacks in the proposed dose range were +1 to -3 mmHg compared with responses in nonblacks of -4 to -6 mmHg.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of moexipril was not significantly influenced by patient age, gender, or weight. Moexipril has been shown to have antihypertensive activity in both pre- and postmenopausal women who have participated in placebo-controlled clinical trials.</p>

When pregnancy is detected, discontinue moexipril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus.</p>
<p>In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus.

<h3>Serum <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022093" conceptname="Electrolyte imbalance">Electrolyte Imbalances</span></h3>
<p class="First">In clinical trials with moexipril monotherapy, persistent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span> (serum potassium above 5.4 mEq/L) occurred in approximately 1.3% of hypertensive patients receiving moexipril. Risk factors for the development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span> with ACE inhibitors include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes.</p>
<p>Treatment with thiazide diuretics has been associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">hyponatremia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4289304" conceptname="Hypochloremic alkalosis">hypochloremic alkalosis</span>.

The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span> is greatest in patients with cirrhosis of the liver, in patients experiencing a brisk <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span>, in patients who are receiving inadequate oral intake of electrolytes, and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with corticosteroids or ACTH.</p>
<p>The opposite effects of moexipril and hydrochlorothiazide on serum potassium will approximately counterbalance each other in many patients, so that little net effect upon serum potassium will be seen. Initial and periodic determinations of serum electrolytes to detect possible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022093" conceptname="Electrolyte imbalance">electrolyte imbalance</span> should be performed at appropriate intervals.</p>
<p>Chloride deficits generally are mild and require specific treatment only under extraordinary circumstances (e.g., in liver disease or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>). Dilutional <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">hyponatremia</span> may occur in edematous patients; appropriate therapy is water restriction rather than administration of salt, except in rare instances when the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">hyponatremia</span> is life-threatening. In actual <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">salt depletion</span>, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.</p>
<p>Calcium excretion is reduced by thiazides. In a few patients on prolonged thiazide therapy, pathological changes in the parathyroid gland have been seen, with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435511" conceptname="Hypercalcemia">hypercalcemia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177973" conceptname="Hypophosphatemia">hypophosphatemia</span>.

<h3>Surgery/Anesthesia</h3>
<p class="First">In patients undergoing major surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, moexipril may block the effects of compensatory renin release. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> occurs in this setting and is considered to be due to this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume expansion.</p>

<h3>Lithium</h3>
<p class="First">Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium toxicity</span> have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. Because renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium toxicity</span> is presumably raised further when, as in therapy with moexipril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic is coadministered with the ACE inhibitor.

<h3>Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)</h3>
<p class="First">In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including moexipril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span>. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving moexipril and NSAID therapy.</p>

<h3>Other Agents</h3>
<p class="First">No clinically important <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interactions</span> occurred when moexipril was administered concomitantly with digoxin or cimetidine.</p>
<p>Moexipril has been used in clinical trials concomitantly with calcium-channel-blocking agents, diuretics, H<span class="Sub">2</span> blockers, digoxin, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>-lowering agents<span class="Sub">. </span>There was no evidence of clinically important adverse interactions.

<h3>Moexipril Hydrochloride</h3>
<p class="First">No evidence of carcinogenicity was detected in long-term studies when moexipril was administered to mice and rats at doses up to 14 or 27.3 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. No mutagenicity was detected in the Ames test and microbial reverse mutation assay, with and without metabolic activation, or in an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> nucleus anomaly test.

<h3>Hydrochlorothiazide</h3>
<p class="First">Under the auspices of the National Toxicology Program, rats and mice received hydrochlorothiazide in their feed for two years, at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in mice and up to 100 mg/kg/day in rats. These studies uncovered no evidence of a carcinogenic potential of hydrochlorothiazide in rats or female mice, but there was equivocal evidence of hepatocarcinogenicity in male mice. Hydrochlorothiazide was not genotoxic in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> assays using <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, TA 1537, and TA 1538 of <span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span> typhimurium </span>(the Ames test); in the CHO test for chromosomal aberrations; or in <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> assays using mouse germinal cell chromosomes, Chinese hamster bone marrow chromosomes; and the <span class="Italics">Drosophila </span>sex-linked recessive lethal trait gene. Positive test results were obtained in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> CHO Sister Chromatid Exchange (clastogenicity) test and in the Mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">Lymphoma</span> Cell (mutagenicity) assays, using concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide of 43 to 1300 mcg/mL. Positive test results were also obtained in the <span class="Italics">Aspergillus nidulans </span>nondisjunction assay, using an unspecified concentration of hydrochlorothiazide.</p>
<p>Hydrochlorothiazide had no adverse effects on the fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies wherein these species were exposed, via their diets, to doses up to 100 and 4 mg/kg/day, respectively, prior to mating and throughout gestation.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">It is not known whether moexipril or moexiprilat is excreted in human milk. Thiazides are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from hydrochlorothiazide and the unknown effects of moexipril or moexiprilat in infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue moexipril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Of the patients who received moexipril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide in controlled clinical studies, 24% were 65 years of age or older. No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between these patients and younger patients. In elderly patients receiving moexipril, plasma levels of drug are slightly higher and renal clearance is reduced when compared to younger patients, but these effects did not have detectable consequences. Hydrochlorothiazide is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Moexipril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide has been evaluated for safety in more than 1140 patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> with more than 120 treated for more than one year. Moexipril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide has not demonstrated a potential for causing adverse experiences different from those previously associated with other ACE inhibitor/diuretic combinations. The overall incidence of reported adverse events was slightly less in patients treated with moexipril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide than patients treated with placebo.</p>
<p>Adverse experiences were usually mild and transient, and there was no relationship between adverse experiences and gender, race, age, or total daily dosage (except for serum potassium decreases at 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide) within the moexipril/hydrochlorothiazide dosage range of 3.75 mg/3.125 mg to 30 mg/50 mg. Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse experiences was required in 5.3% of patients treated with moexipril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide and in 8.4% of patients treated with placebo. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with moexipril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> (0.5%) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span> (0.5%).</p>
<p>All adverse experiences considered at least possibly related to treatment that occurred at any dose in placebo-controlled trials of once-daily dosing in more than 1% of patients treated with moexipril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide and that were at least as frequent in the moexipril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide group as in the placebo group are shown in the following table.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with moexipril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide. Treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Therapy with moexipril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide should be discontinued and the patient observed closely. Suggested measures include induction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> and/or gastric lavage and correction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435796" conceptname="Dehydration">dehydration</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022093" conceptname="Electrolyte imbalance">electrolyte imbalance</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> by established procedures.</p>
<p>Single oral doses of 2 g/kg moexipril were associated with significant lethality in mice. Rats, however, tolerated single oral doses of up to 3 g/kg. The oral LD<span class="Sub">50</span> of hydrochlorothiazide is greater than 10 g/kg in mice and rats. For the combination of moexipril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide (ratio 7.5:12.5), the approximate LD<span class="Sub">50</span> was around 10 g/kg for mice and above 10 g/kg for rats. Addition of hydrochlorothiazide to moexipril hydrochloride did not increase the acute toxicity due to moexipril hydrochloride.</p>
<p>Human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> of moexipril have not been reported. In case reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> with other ACE inhibitors, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> has been the principal adverse effect noted. The most common signs and symptoms observed with an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> of hydrochlorothiazide have been those of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435796" conceptname="Dehydration">dehydration</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4077438" conceptname="Electrolyte depletion">electrolyte depletion</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4016089" conceptname="Hypochloremia">hypochloremia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">hyponatremia</span>).

<p>No data are available to suggest that physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) would accelerate elimination of moexipril and its metabolites. The dialyzability of moexipril is not known.</p>
<p>Angiotensin II could presumably serve as a specific antagonist-antidote in the setting of moexipril <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, but angiotensin II is essentially unavailable outside of research facilities. Because the hypotensive effect of moexipril is achieved through vasodilation and effective <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436375" conceptname="Hypovolemia">hypovolemia</span>, it is reasonable to treat moexipril <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> by infusion of normal saline solution. In addition, renal function and serum potassium should be monitored.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Moexipril and hydrochlorothiazide are effective treatments for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>. The recommended dosage range of moexipril is 7.5 to 30 mg daily, administered in a single or two divided doses one hour before meals, while hydrochlorothiazide is effective in a dosage of 12.5 to 50 mg daily.</p>
<p>The side effects (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_warnings_id_5105bb58-3b8f-4d8e-b744-4574f321be2d">WARNINGS</a></span>) of moexipril are generally rare and apparently independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>) and dose-independent phenomena (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192640" conceptname="Pancreatitis">pancreatitis</span>), the former much more common than the latter. Therapy with any combination of moexipril and hydrochlorothiazide will be associated with both sets of dose-independent side effects, but regimens in which moexipril is combined with low doses of hydrochlorothiazide produce minimal effects on serum potassium. In moexipril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide controlled clinical trials, the average change in serum potassium was near zero in subjects who received 3.75 mg/6.25 mg or 7.5 mg/12.5 mg, but subjects who received 15 mg/12.5 mg or 15 mg/25 mg experienced a mild decrease in serum potassium, similar to that experienced by subjects who received the same dose of hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy. To minimize dose-independent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy.</p>

<h2>Dose Titration Guided by Clinical Effect</h2>
<p class="First">A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with either moexipril or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy may be given moexipril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, 7.5 mg/12.5 mg, moexipril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, 15 mg/12.5 mg or moexipril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, 15 mg/25 mg one hour before a meal. Further increases of moexipril, hydrochlorothiazide or both depend on clinical response. The hydrochlorothiazide dose should generally not be increased until 2 to 3 weeks have elapsed.</p>
<p>Total daily doses above 30 mg/50 mg a day have not been studied in hypertensive patients. Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide daily, but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen, may achieve blood pressure control without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022093" conceptname="Electrolyte imbalance">electrolyte disturbance</span> if they are switched to moexipril 3.75 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg (one-half of the moexipril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablet, 7.5 mg/12.5 mg). For patients who experience an excessive reduction in blood pressure with moexipril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, 7.5 mg/12.5 mg, the physician may consider prescribing moexipril 3.75 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg.</p>

In patients with more severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides, so moexipril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are not recommended (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>, <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_precautions_general_id_b81788cd-2618-494d-9d5c-938eae8f6a67">General</a></span>).</p>
