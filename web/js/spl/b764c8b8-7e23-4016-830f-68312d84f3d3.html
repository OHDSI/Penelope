<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">TAMBOCOR has local anesthetic activity and belongs to the membrane stabilizing (Class 1) group of antiarrhythmic agents; it has electrophysiologic effects characteristic of the IC class of antiarrhythmics.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="e4"></a><a name="section-4.1"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Electrophysiology.</span> In man, TAMBOCOR produces a dose-related decrease in intracardiac conduction in all parts of the heart with the greatest effect on the His-Purkinje system (H-V conduction). Effects upon atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction time and intra-atrial conduction times, although present, are less pronounced than those on ventricular conduction velocity. Significant effects on refractory periods were observed only in the ventricle.</p>
<p>Sinus node recovery times (corrected) following pacing and spontaneous cycle lengths are somewhat increased. This latter effect may become significant in patients with sinus node dysfunction. (See <a href="#s9">Warnings.</a>)</p>
<p>TAMBOCOR causes a dose-related and plasma-level related decrease in single and multiple PVCs and can suppress recurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">ventricular tachycardia</span>. In limited studies of patients with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">ventricular tachycardia</span>, TAMBOCOR has been successful 30-40% of the time in fully suppressing the inducibility of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span> by programmed electrical stimulation. Based on PVC suppression, it appears that plasma levels of 0.2 to 1.0 μg/mL may be needed to obtain the maximal therapeutic effect. It is more difficult to assess the dose needed to suppress serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span>, but trough plasma levels in patients successfully treated for recurrent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">ventricular tachycardia</span> were between 0.2 and 1.0 μg/mL. Plasma levels above 0.7-1.0 μg/mL are associated with a higher rate of cardiac adverse experiences such as conduction defects or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>. The relation of plasma levels to proarrhythmic events is not established, but dose reduction in clinical trials of patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">ventricular tachycardia</span> appears to have led to a reduced frequency and severity of such events.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hemodynamics.</span> TAMBOCOR does not usually alter heart rate, although <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span> have been reported occasionally.</p>
<p>In animals and isolated myocardium, a negative inotropic effect of flecainide has been demonstrated. Decreases in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4108582" conceptname="Left ventricular ejection fraction">ejection fraction</span>, consistent with a negative inotropic effect, have been observed after single administration of 200 to 250 mg of the drug in man; both increases and decreases in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4108582" conceptname="Left ventricular ejection fraction">ejection fraction</span> have been encountered during multidose therapy in patients at usual therapeutic doses. (See <a href="#s9">Warnings.</a>)</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Metabolism in Humans.</span> Following oral administration, the absorption of TAMBOCOR is nearly complete. Peak plasma levels are attained at about three hours in most individuals (range, 1 to 6 hours). Flecainide does not undergo any consequential presystemic biotransformation (first-pass effect). Food or antacid do not affect absorption. Milk, however, may inhibit absorption in infants. A reduction in TAMBOCOR dosage should be considered when milk is removed from the diet of infants.</p>
<p>The apparent plasma half-life averages about 20 hours and is quite variable (range, 12 to 27 hours) after multiple oral doses in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4008580" conceptname="Ventricular bigeminy">premature ventricular contractions</span> (PVCs). With multiple dosing, plasma levels increase because of its long half-life with steady-state levels approached in 3 to 5 days; once at steady-state, no additional (or unexpected) accumulation of drug in plasma occurs during chronic therapy. Over the usual therapeutic range, data suggest that plasma levels in an individual are approximately proportional to dose, deviating upwards from linearity only slightly (about 10 to 15% per 100 mg on average).</p>
<p>In healthy subjects, about 30% of a single oral dose (range, 10 to 50%) is excreted in urine as unchanged drug. The two major urinary metabolites are meta-O-dealkylated flecainide (active, but about one-fifth as potent) and the meta-O-dealkylated lactam of flecainide (non-active metabolite). These two metabolites (primarily conjugated) account for most of the remaining portion of the dose. Several minor metabolites (3% of the dose or less) are also found in urine; only 5% of an oral dose is excreted in feces. In patients, free (unconjugated) plasma levels of the two major metabolites are very low (less than 0.05 μg/mL).</p>
<p>In vitro metabolic studies have confirmed that cytochrome P450IID6 is involved in the metabolism of flecainide.</p>
<p>When urinary pH is very alkaline (8 or higher), as may occur in rare conditions (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4070448" conceptname="Renal tubular acidosis">renal tubular acidosis</span>, strict vegetarian diet), flecainide elimination from plasma is much slower.</p>
<p>The elimination of flecainide from the body depends on renal function (i.e., 10 to 50% appears in urine as unchanged drug). With increasing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, the extent of unchanged drug excretion in urine is reduced and the plasma half-life of flecainide is prolonged. Since flecainide is also extensively metabolized, there is no simple relationship between creatinine clearance and the rate of flecainide elimination from plasma. (See <a href="#s28">Dosage and Administration.</a>)</p>
<p>In patients with NYHA class III <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span> (CHF), the rate of flecainide elimination from plasma (mean half-life, 19 hours) is moderately slower than for healthy subjects (mean half-life, 14 hours), but similar to the rate for patients with PVCs without CHF. The extent of excretion of unchanged drug in urine is also similar. (See <a href="#s28">Dosage and Administration.</a>)</p>
<p>Under one year of age, currently available data are limited but suggest that the half-life at birth may be as long as 29 hours, decreasing to 11-12 hours by three months of age and 6 hours by one year of age. The pharmacokinetics in hydropic infants have not been studied, but case reports suggest prolonged elimination. In children aged 1 year to 12 years the half-life is approximately 8 hours. In adolescents (age 12 to 15) the plasma elimination half-life is approximately 11-12 hours. Since milk may inhibit absorption in infants, a reduction in TAMBOCOR dosage should be considered when milk is removed from the diet (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4101468" conceptname="Gastroenteritis">gastroenteritis</span>, weaning). Plasma trough flecainide levels should be monitored during major changes in dietary milk intake.</p>
<p>From age 20 to 80, plasma levels are only slightly higher with advancing age; flecainide elimination from plasma is somewhat slower in elderly subjects than in younger subjects. Patients up to age 80+ have been safely treated with usual dosages.</p>
<p>The extent of flecainide binding to human plasma proteins is about 40% and is independent of plasma drug level over the range of 0.015 to about</p>
<p>3.4 μg/mL. Thus, clinically significant drug interactions based on protein binding effects would not be expected.</p>
<p>Hemodialysis removes only about 1% of an oral dose as unchanged flecainide.</p>
<p>Small increases in plasma digoxin levels are seen during coadministration of TAMBOCOR with digoxin. Small increases in both flecainide and propranolol plasma levels are seen during coadministration of these two drugs. (See <a href="#s19">Precautions, Drug Interactions.</a>)</p>

Exacerbation of preexisting CHF occurred more commonly in studies which included patients with class III or IV failure than in studies which excluded such patients. TAMBOCOR should be used cautiously in patients who are known to have a history of CHF or myocardial dysfunction. The initial dosage in such patients should be no more than 100 mg bid (see <a href="#s28">Dosage and Administration</a>) and patients should be monitored carefully. Close attention must be given to maintenance of cardiac function, including optimization of digitalis, diuretic, or other therapy. In cases where CHF has developed or worsened during treatment with TAMBOCOR, the time of onset has ranged from a few hours to several months after starting therapy. Some patients who develop evidence of reduced myocardial function while on TAMBOCOR can continue on TAMBOCOR with adjustment of digitalis or diuretics, others may require dosage reduction or discontinuation of TAMBOCOR. When feasible, it is recommended that plasma flecainide levels be monitored. Attempts should be made to keep trough plasma levels below 0.7 to 1.0 μg/mL.</span></p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effects on Cardiac Conduction.</span> TAMBOCOR slows cardiac conduction in most patients to produce dose-related increases in PR, QRS, and QT intervals. PR interval increases on average about 25% (0.04 seconds) and as much as 118% in some patients. Approximately one-third of patients may develop new first-degree AV <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316135" conceptname="Atrioventricular block">heart block</span> (PR interval ≥0.20 seconds). The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4064625" conceptname="QRS complex feature">QRS complex</span> increases on average about 25% (0.02 seconds) and as much as 150% in some patients. Many patients develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4064625" conceptname="QRS complex feature">QRS complexes</span> with a duration of 0.12 seconds or more. In one study, 4% of patients developed new <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313791" conceptname="Bundle branch block">bundle branch block</span> while on TAMBOCOR. The degree of lengthening of PR and QRS intervals does not predict either efficacy or the development of cardiac adverse effects. In clinical trials, it was unusual for PR intervals to increase to 0.30 seconds or more, or for QRS intervals to increase to 0.18 seconds or more. Thus, caution should be used when such intervals occur, and dose reductions may be considered. The QT interval widens about 8%, but most of this widening (about 60% to 90%) is due to widening of the QRS duration. The JT interval (QT minus QRS) only widens about 4% on the average. Significant JT prolongation occurs in less than 2% of patients. There have been rare cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135823" conceptname="Torsades de pointes">Torsade de Pointes</span>-type <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span> associated with TAMBOCOR therapy.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effects on Pacemaker Thresholds.</span> TAMBOCOR is known to increase endocardial pacing thresholds and may suppress ventricular escape rhythms. These effects are reversible if flecainide is discontinued. It should be used with caution in patients with permanent pacemakers or temporary pacing electrodes and should not be administered to patients with existing poor thresholds or nonprogrammable pacemakers unless suitable pacing rescue is available.</p>
<p>The pacing threshold in patients with pacemakers should be determined prior to instituting therapy with TAMBOCOR, again after one week of administration and at regular intervals thereafter. Generally threshold changes are within the range of multiprogrammable pacemakers and, when these occur, a doubling of either voltage or pulse width is usually sufficient to regain capture.</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34073-7">
<a name="s19"></a><a name="section-10.1"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions.</span> TAMBOCOR has been administered to patients receiving <span class="Bold">digitalis</span> preparations or <span class="Bold">beta-adrenergic blocking agents</span> without adverse effects. During administration of multiple oral doses of TAMBOCOR to healthy subjects stabilized on a maintenance dose of <span class="Bold">digoxin</span>, a 13% - 19% increase in plasma <span class="Bold">digoxin</span> levels occurred at six hours postdose.</p>
<p>In a study involving healthy subjects receiving TAMBOCOR and <span class="Bold">propranolol</span> concurrently, plasma flecainide levels were increased about 20% and <span class="Bold">propranolol</span> levels were increased about 30% compared to control values. In this formal interaction study, TAMBOCOR and <span class="Bold">propranolol</span> were each found to have negative inotropic effects; when the drugs were administered together, the effects were additive. The effects of concomitant administration of TAMBOCOR and <span class="Bold">propranolol</span> on the PR interval were less than additive. In TAMBOCOR clinical trials, patients who were receiving <span class="Bold">beta blockers</span> concurrently did not experience an increased incidence of side effects. Nevertheless, the possibility of additive negative inotropic effects of <span class="Bold">beta blockers</span> and flecainide should be recognized.</p>
<p>Flecainide is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. In vitro studies with several drugs which may be administered concomitantly showed that the extent of flecainide binding to human plasma proteins is either unchanged or only slightly less. Consequently, interactions with other drugs which are highly protein bound (e.g., <span class="Bold">anticoagulants</span>) would not be expected. TAMBOCOR has been used in a large number of patients receiving <span class="Bold">diuretics</span> without apparent interaction. Limited data in patients receiving known enzyme inducers (<span class="Bold">phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine</span>) indicate only a 30% increase in the rate of flecainide elimination. In healthy subjects receiving <span class="Bold">cimetidine</span> (1 gm daily) for one week, plasma flecainide levels increased by about 30% and half-life increased by about 10%.</p>
<p>When <span class="Bold">amiodarone</span> is added to flecainide therapy, plasma flecainide levels may increase two-fold or more in some patients, if flecainide dosage is not reduced. (See <a href="#s28">Dosage And Administration</a>)</p>
<p>Drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450IID6, such as <span class="Bold">quinidine</span>, might increase the plasma concentrations of flecainide in patients that are on chronic flecainide therapy; especially if these patients are extensive metabolizers.</p>
<p>There has been little experience with the coadministration of TAMBOCOR and either <span class="Bold">disopyramide</span> or <span class="Bold">verapamil</span>. Because both of these drugs have negative inotropic properties and the effects of coadministration with TAMBOCOR are unknown, neither <span class="Bold">disopyramide</span> nor <span class="Bold">verapamil</span> should be administered concurrently with TAMBOCOR unless, in the judgment of the physician, the benefits of this combination outweigh the risks. There has been too little experience with the coadministration of TAMBOCOR with <span class="Bold">nifedipine</span> or <span class="Bold">diltiazem</span> to recommend concomitant use.</p>

No teratogenic effects were observed in rats and mice given doses up to 50 and 80 mg/kg/day, respectively; however, delayed sternebral and vertebral ossification was observed at the high dose in rats.

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">No specific antidote has been identified for the treatment of TAMBOCOR overdosage. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">Overdoses</span> ranging up to 8000 mg have been survived, with peak plasma flecainide concentrations as high as 5.3 μg/mL.

The spectrum of events observed in fatal cases was much the same as that seen in the non-fatal cases. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Death</span> has resulted following ingestion of as little as 1000 mg; concomitant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> of other drugs and/or alcohol in many instances undoubtedly contributed to the fatal outcome. Treatment of overdosage should be supportive and may include the following: removal of unabsorbed drug from the gastrointestinal tract, administration of inotropic agents or cardiac stimulants such as dopamine, dobutamine or isoproterenol; mechanically assisted respiration; circulatory assists such as intra-aortic balloon pumping; and transvenous pacing in the event of conduction block. Because of the long plasma half-life of flecainide (12 to 27 hours in patients receiving usual doses), and the possibility of markedly non-linear elimination kinetics at very high doses, these supportive treatments may need to be continued for extended periods of time.</p>
<p>Hemodialysis is not an effective means of removing flecainide from the body. Since flecainide elimination is much slower when urine is very alkaline (pH 8 or higher), theoretically, acidification of urine to promote drug excretion may be beneficial in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> cases with very alkaline urine. There is no evidence that acidification from normal urinary pH increases excretion.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">For patients with</span><span class="Bold Underline">sustained</span><span class="Bold">VT, no matter what their cardiac status, TAMBOCOR, like other antiarrhythmics, should be initiated in-hospital with rhythm monitoring.</span></p>
<p>Flecainide has a long half-life (12 to 27 hours in patients). Steady-state plasma levels, in patients with normal renal and hepatic function, may not be achieved until the patient has received 3 to 5 days of therapy at a given dose. Therefore, <span class="Bold">increases in dosage should be made no more frequently than once every four days</span>, since during the first 2 to 3 days of therapy the optimal effect of a given dose may not be achieved.</p>
<p>For patients with PSVT and patients with PAF the recommended starting dose is 50 mg every 12 hours. TAMBOCOR doses may be increased in increments of 50 mg bid every four days until efficacy is achieved. For PAF patients, a substantial increase in efficacy without a substantial increase in discontinuations for adverse experiences may be achieved by increasing the TAMBOCOR dose from 50 to 100 mg bid. The maximum recommended dose for patients with paroxysmal supraventricular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span> is 300 mg/day.</p>
<p>For <span class="Underline">sustained</span> VT the recommended starting dose is 100 mg every 12 hours. This dose may be increased in increments of 50 mg bid every four days until efficacy is achieved. Most patients with <span class="Underline">sustained</span> VT do not require more than 150 mg every 12 hours (300 mg/day) and the maximum dose recommended is 400 mg/day.</p>
<p>In patients with <span class="Underline">sustained</span> VT, use of higher initial doses and more rapid dosage adjustments have resulted in an increased incidence of proarrhythmic events and CHF, particularly during the first few days of dosing (see <a href="#s9">Warnings</a>). Therefore, a loading dose is not recommended.</p>
<p>Intravenous lidocaine has been used occasionally with TAMBOCOR while awaiting the therapeutic effect of TAMBOCOR. No adverse drug interactions were apparent. However, no formal studies have been performed to demonstrate the usefulness of this regimen.</p>
<p>An occasional patient not adequately controlled by (or intolerant to) a dose given at 12-hour intervals may be dosed at eight-hour intervals.</p>
<p>Once adequate control of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span> has been achieved, it may be possible in some patients to reduce the dose as necessary to minimize side effects or effects on conduction. In such patients, efficacy at the lower dose should be evaluated.</p>
<p>TAMBOCOR should be used cautiously in patients with a history of CHF or myocardial dysfunction (see <a href="#s9">Warnings</a>).</p>
<p>Any use of TAMBOCOR in children should be directly supervised by a cardiologist skilled in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span> in children. Because of the evolving nature of information in this area, specialized literature should be consulted. Under six months of age, the initial starting dose of TAMBOCOR in children is approximately 50 mg/M<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area daily, divided into two or three equally spaced doses. Over six months of age, the initial starting dose may be increased to 100 mg/M<span class="Sup">2</span> per day. The maximum recommended dose is 200 mg/M<span class="Sup">2</span> per day. This dose should not be exceeded. In some children on higher doses, despite previously low plasma levels, the level has increased rapidly to far above therapeutic values while taking the same dose. Small changes in dose may also lead to disproportionate increases in plasma levels. Plasma trough (less than one hour pre-dose) flecainide levels and electrocardiograms should be obtained at presumed steady state (after at least five doses) either after initiation or change in TAMBOCOR dose, whether the dose was increased for lack of effectiveness, or increased growth of the patient. For the first year on therapy, whenever the patient is seen for reasons of clinical follow-up, it is suggested that a 12-lead electrocardiogram and plasma trough flecainide level are obtained. The usual therapeutic level of flecainide in children is 200-500 ng/mL. In some cases, levels as high as 800 ng/mL may be required for control.</p>
<p>In patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (creatinine clearance of 35 mL/min/1.73 square meters or less), the initial dosage should be 100 mg once daily (or 50 mg bid); when used in such patients, frequent plasma level monitoring is required to guide dosage adjustments (see <a href="#s29">Plasma Level Monitoring</a>). In patients with less severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>, the initial dosage should be 100 mg every 12 hours; plasma level monitoring may also be useful in these patients during dosage adjustment. In both groups of patients, dosage increases should be made very cautiously when plasma levels have plateaued (after more than four days), observing the patient closely for signs of adverse cardiac effects or other toxicity. It should be borne in mind that in these patients it may take longer than four days before a new steady-state plasma level is reached following a dosage change.</p>
<p>Based on theoretical considerations, rather than experimental data, the following suggestion is made: when transferring patients from another antiarrhythmic drug to TAMBOCOR allow at least two to four plasma half-lives to elapse for the drug being discontinued before starting TAMBOCOR at the usual dosage. In patients where withdrawal of a previous antiarrhythmic agent is likely to produce life-threatening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span>, the physician should consider hospitalizing the patient.</p>
<p>When flecainide is given in the presence of amiodarone, reduce the usual flecainide dose by 50% and monitor the patient closely for adverse effects.</p>
<p>Plasma level monitoring is strongly recommended to guide dosage with such combination therapy (see below).</p>

<a name="s29"></a><a name="section-13.1"></a><p></p>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Plasma Level Monitoring:</span> The large majority of patients successfully treated with TAMBOCOR were found to have trough plasma levels between 0.2 and 1.0 μg/mL. The probability of adverse experiences, especially cardiac, may increase with higher trough plasma levels, especially when these exceed 1.0 μg/mL. Periodic monitoring of trough plasma levels may be useful in patient management. Plasma level monitoring is required in patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> or severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span>, since elimination of flecainide from plasma may be markedly slower. Monitoring of plasma levels is strongly recommended in patients on concurrent amiodarone therapy and may also be helpful in patients with CHF and in patients with moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>.</p>
