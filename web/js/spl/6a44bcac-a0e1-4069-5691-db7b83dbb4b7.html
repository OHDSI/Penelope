<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Sodium nitroprusside is disodium pentacyanonitrosylferrate(2-) dihydrate, a hypotensive agent whose structural formula is</p>
<p><img alt="structural formula for sodium nitroprusside" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=6a44bcac-a0e1-4069-5691-db7b83dbb4b7&amp;name=nitropress1-figure-1-xen-1589-1.jpg">Â </p>
<p>Sodium Nitroprusside</p>
<p>whose molecular formula is Na<span class="Sub">2</span>[Fe(CN)<span class="Sub">5</span>NO] â€¢ 2H<span class="Sub">2</span>O, and whose molecular weight is 297.95. Dry sodium nitroprusside is a reddish-brown powder, soluble in water. In an aqueous solution infused intravenously, sodium nitroprusside is a rapid-acting vasodilator, active on both arteries and veins. </p>
<p>Sodium nitroprusside solution is rapidly degraded by trace contaminants, often with resulting color changes. (See <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics"><a href="#b9b858b1-93fe-48b5-8e3f-23a3b62c9a01">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>Â </span></span></span>section.) The solution is also sensitive to certain wavelengths of light, and it must be protected from light in clinical use. </p>
<p>NITROPRESS (Sodium Nitroprusside Injection) is available as:</p>
<p>50 mg Fliptop Vial â€“ Each 2 mL vial contains the equivalent of 50 mg sodium nitroprusside dihydrate in sterile water for injection.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">The principal pharmacological action of sodium nitroprusside is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins. Other smooth muscle (<span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">e.g.</span></span>, uterus, duodenum) is not affected. Sodium nitroprusside is more active on veins than on arteries, but this selectivity is much less marked than that of nitroglycerin. Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span>, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. </p>
<p>In association with the decrease in blood pressure, sodium nitroprusside administered intravenously to hypertensive and normotensive patients produces slight increases in heart rate and a variable effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span>. In hypertensive patients, moderate doses induce renal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4237053" conceptname="Vasodilatation">vasodilatation</span> roughly proportional to the decrease in systemic blood pressure, so there is no appreciable change in renal blood flow or glomerular filtration rate. </p>
<p>In normotensive subjects, acute reduction of mean arterial pressure to 60-75 mm Hg by infusion of sodium nitroprusside caused a significant increase in renin activity. In the same study, ten renovascular-hypertensive patients given sodium nitroprusside had significant increases in renin release from the involved kidney at mean arterial pressures of 90-137 mm Hg. </p>
<p>The hypotensive effect of sodium nitroprusside is seen within a minute or two after the start of an adequate infusion, and it dissipates almost as rapidly after an infusion is discontinued. The effect is augmented by ganglionic blocking agents and inhaled anesthetics. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism:</span></span> Infused sodium nitroprusside is rapidly distributed to a volume that is approximately coextensive with the extracellular space. The drug is cleared from this volume by intraerythrocytic reaction with hemoglobin (Hgb), and sodium nitroprussideâ€™s resulting circulatory half-life is about 2 minutes. </p>
<p>The products of the nitroprusside/hemoglobin reaction are cyanmethemoglobin (cyanmetHgb) and cyanide ion (CNÂ¯). Safe use of sodium nitroprusside injection must be guided by knowledge of the further metabolism of these products. </p>
<p>As shown in the diagram below, the essential features of nitroprusside metabolism are </p>
<ul>
<li>one molecule of sodium nitroprusside is metabolized by combination with hemoglobin to produce one molecule of cyanmethemoglobin and four CNÂ¯ ions; </li>
<li>methemoglobin, obtained from hemoglobin, can sequester cyanide as cyanmethemoglobin; </li>
<li>thiosulfate reacts with cyanide to produce thiocyanate; </li>
<li>thiocyanate is eliminated in the urine; </li>
<li>cyanide not otherwise removed binds to cytochromes; and </li>
<li>cyanide is much more toxic than methemoglobin or thiocyanate.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="drawing of Metabolism of Sodium Nitroprusside" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=6a44bcac-a0e1-4069-5691-db7b83dbb4b7&amp;name=nitropress1-figure-2-xen-1589-2.jpg"></p>
<p>Cyanide ion is normally found in serum; it is derived from dietary substrates and from tobacco smoke. Cyanide binds avidly (but reversibly) to ferric ion (Fe<span class="Sup">+++</span>), most body stores of which are found in erythrocyte methemoglobin (metHgb) and in mitochondrial cytochromes. When CNÂ¯ is infused or generated within the bloodstream, essentially all of it is bound to methemoglobin until intraerythrocytic methemoglobin has been saturated. </p>
<p>When the Fe<span class="Sup">+++</span> of cytochromes is bound to cyanide, the cytochromes are unable to participate in oxidative metabolism. In this situation, cells may be able to provide for their energy needs by utilizing anaerobic pathways, but they thereby generate an increasing body burden of lactic acid. Other cells may be unable to utilize these alternative pathways, and they may die <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxic</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span>. </p>
<p>CNÂ¯ levels in packed erythrocytes are typically less than 1 Âµmol/L (less than 25 mcg/L); levels are roughly doubled in heavy smokers. </p>
<p>At healthy steady state, most people have less than 1% of their hemoglobin in the form of methemoglobin. Nitroprusside metabolism can lead to methemoglobin formation (a) through dissociation of cyanmethemoglobin formed in the original reaction of sodium nitroprusside with Hgb and (b) by direct oxidation of Hgb by the released nitroso group. Relatively large quantities of sodium nitroprusside, however, are required to produce significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">methemoglobinemia</span>. </p>
<p>At physiologic methemoglobin levels, the CNÂ¯ binding capacity of packed red cells is a little less than 200 Âµmol/L (5 mg/L). Cytochrome toxicity is seen at levels only slightly higher, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> has been reported at levels from 300 to 3000 Âµmol/L (8â€“80 mg/L). Put another way, a patient with a normal red-cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> (35 mL/kg) and normal methemoglobin levels can buffer about 175 mcg/kg of CNÂ¯, corresponding to a little less than 500 mcg/kg of infused sodium nitroprusside. </p>
<p>Some cyanide is eliminated from the body as expired hydrogen cyanide, but most is enzymatically converted to thiocyanate (SCNÂ¯) by thiosulfate-cyanide sulfur transferase (rhodanase, EC 2.8.1.1), a mitochondrial enzyme. The enzyme is normally present in great excess, so the reaction is rate-limited by the availability of sulfur donors, especially thiosulfate, cystine, and cysteine. </p>
<p>Thiosulfate is a normal constituent of serum, produced from cysteine by way of Î²-mercaptopyruvate. Physiological levels of thiosulfate are typically about 0.1 mmol/L (11 mg/L), but they are approximately twice this level in pediatric and adult patients who are not eating. Infused thiosulfate is cleared from the body (primarily by the kidneys) with a half-life of about 20 minutes. </p>
<p>When thiosulfate is being supplied only by normal physiologic mechanisms, conversion of CNÂ¯ to SCNÂ¯ generally proceeds at about 1 mcg/kg/min. This rate of CNÂ¯ clearance corresponds to steady-state processing of a sodium nitroprusside infusion of slightly more than 2 mcg/kg/min. CNÂ¯ begins to accumulate when sodium nitroprusside infusions exceed this rate. </p>
<p>Thiocyanate (SCNÂ¯) is also a normal physiological constituent of serum, with normal levels typically in the range of 50-250 Âµmol/L (3-15 mg/L). Clearance of SCNÂ¯ is primarily renal, with a half-life of about 3Â days. In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span>, the half-life can be doubled or tripled. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Clinical Trials: </span></span>Baseline-controlled clinical trials have uniformly shown that sodium nitroprusside has a prompt hypotensive effect, at least initially, in all populations. With increasing rates of infusion, sodium nitroprusside has been able to lower blood pressure without an observed limit of effect. </p>
<p>Clinical trials have also shown that the hypotensive effect of sodium nitroprusside is associated with reduced blood loss in a variety of major surgical procedures. </p>
<p>In patients with acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span> and increased peripheral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span>, administration of sodium nitroprusside causes reductions in peripheral resistance, increases in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span>, and reductions in left ventricular filling pressure. </p>
<p>Many trials have verified the clinical significance of the metabolic pathways described above. In patients receiving unopposed infusions of sodium nitroprusside, cyanide and thiocyanate levels have increased with increasing rates of sodium nitroprusside infusion. Mild to moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span> has usually accompanied higher cyanide levels, but peak base deficits have lagged behind the peak cyanide levels by an hour or more. </p>
<p>Progressive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052861" conceptname="Tachyphylaxis">tachyphylaxis</span> to the hypotensive effects of sodium nitroprusside has been reported in several trials and numerous case reports. This <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052861" conceptname="Tachyphylaxis">tachyphylaxis</span> has frequently been attributed to concomitant cyanide toxicity, but the only evidence adduced for this assertion has been the observation that in patients treated with sodium nitroprusside and found to be resistant to its hypotensive effects, cyanide levels are often found to be elevated. In the only reported <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">comparisons </span></span>of cyanide levels in resistant and nonresistant patients, cyanide levels did <span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">not</span></span> correlate with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052861" conceptname="Tachyphylaxis">tachyphylaxis</span>. The mechanism of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052861" conceptname="Tachyphylaxis">tachyphylaxis</span> to sodium nitroprusside remains unknown. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Pediatric: </span></span>The effects of sodium nitroprusside to induce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> were evaluated in two trials in pediatric patients less than 17 years of age. In both trials, at least 50% of the patients were pre-pubertal, and about 50% of these pre-pubertal patients were less than 2 years of age, including 4 neonates. The primary efficacy variable was the mean arterial pressure (MAP).</p>
<p>There were 203 pediatric patients in a parallel, dose-ranging study (Study 1). During the 30 minute blinded phase, patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive sodium nitroprusside 0.3, 1, 2, or 3 Î¼g/kg/min. The infusion rate was increased step-wise to the target dose rate (i.e., 1/3 of the full rate for the first 5Â minutes, 2/3 of the full rate for the next 5 minutes, and the full dose rate for the last 20 minutes). If the investigator believed that an increase to the next higher dose rate would be unsafe, the infusion remained at the current rate for the remainder of the blinded infusion. Since there was no placebo group, the change from baseline likely overestimates the true magnitude of blood pressure effect. Nevertheless, MAP decreased 11 to 20 mmHg from baseline across the four doses (Table 1).</p>
<p>There were 63 pediatric patients in a long-term infusion trial (Study 2). During an open-label phase (12 to 24 hours), sodium nitroprusside was started at â‰¤0.3 Î¼g/kg/min and titrated according to the BP response.</p>
<p>Patients were then randomized to placebo or to continuing the same dose of sodium nitroprusside. The average MAP was greater in the control group than in the sodium nitroprusside group for every time point during the blinded withdrawal phase, demonstrating that sodium nitroprusside is effective for at least 12 hours.</p>
<p>In both studies, similar effects on MAP were seen in all age groups.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First">(See also the boxed warning at the beginning of this insert.) </p>
<p>The principal hazards of NITROPRESS administration are excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> and excessive accumulation of cyanide (see also <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics"><a href="#d06ac417-7df0-49ff-b290-d9fd22580378">OVERDOSAGE</a></span></span></span> and <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics"><a href="#b9b858b1-93fe-48b5-8e3f-23a3b62c9a01">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span></span></span>). </p>

These hemodynamic changes may lead to a variety of associated symptoms; see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics"><a href="#f6d5e792-db1d-44d2-adf1-e5e48c2b6662">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span></span></span>. Nitroprusside-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> will be self-limited within 1-10 minutes after discontinuation of the nitroprusside infusion; during these few minutes, it may be helpful to put the patient into a head-down (Trendelenburg) position to maximize venous return. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> persists more than a few minutes after discontinuation of the infusion of NITROPRESS, NITROPRESS is not the cause, and the true cause must be sought. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Cyanide Toxicity:</span></span> As described in <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics"><a href="#fa1687de-d7fa-489d-83e0-5ceb3799b8c6">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span></span></span> above, sodium nitroprusside infusions at rates above 2 mcg/kg/min generate cyanide ion (CNÂ¯) faster than the body can normally dispose of it. (When sodium thiosulfate is given, as described under <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics"><a href="#b9b858b1-93fe-48b5-8e3f-23a3b62c9a01">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span></span></span>, the bodyâ€™s capacity for CNÂ¯ elimination is greatly increased.) Methemoglobin normally present in the body can buffer a certain amount of CNÂ¯, but the capacity of this system is exhausted by the CNÂ¯ produced from about 500 mcg/kg of sodium nitroprusside. This amount of sodium nitroprusside is administered in less than an hour when the drug is administered at 10 mcg/kg/min (the maximum recommended rate). Thereafter, the toxic effects of CNÂ¯ may be rapid, serious, and even lethal. </p>
<p>The true rates of clinically important cyanide toxicity cannot be assessed from spontaneous reports or published data. Most patients reported to have experienced such toxicity have received relatively prolonged infusions, and the only patients whose <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> have been unequivocally attributed to nitroprusside-induced cyanide toxicity have been patients who had received nitroprusside infusions at rates (30-120 mcg/kg/min) much greater than those now recommended.

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">General: </span></span>Like other vasodilators, sodium nitroprusside can cause increases in intracranial pressure. In patients whose intracranial pressure is already elevated, sodium nitroprusside should be used only with extreme caution. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Hepatic:</span></span> Use caution when administering nitroprusside to patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic insufficiency</span>. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Use in Anesthesia:</span></span> When sodium nitroprusside (or any other vasodilator) is used for controlled <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> during anesthesia, the patientâ€™s capacity to compensate for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436375" conceptname="Hypovolemia">hypovolemia</span> may be diminished. If possible, pre-existing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436375" conceptname="Hypovolemia">hypovolemia</span> should be corrected prior to administration of NITROPRESS. </p>
<p>Hypotensive anesthetic techniques may also cause abnormalities of the pulmonary ventilation/perfusion ratio. Patients intolerant of these abnormalities may require a higher fraction of inspired oxygen. </p>
<p>Extreme caution should be exercised in patients who are especially poor surgical risks (A.S.A. Class 4 and 4E). </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Laboratory Tests:</span></span> The cyanide-level assay is technically difficult, and cyanide levels in body fluids other than packed red blood cells are difficult to interpret. Cyanide toxicity will lead to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span> and venous hyperoxemia, but these findings may not be present until an hour or more after the cyanide capacity of the bodyâ€™s red-cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> has been exhausted. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Drug Interactions:</span></span> The hypotensive effect of sodium nitroprusside is augmented by that of most other hypotensive drugs, including ganglionic blocking agents, negative inotropic agents, and inhaled anesthetics. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility:</span></span> Animal studies assessing sodium nitroprussideâ€™s carcinogenicity and mutagenicity have not been conducted. Similarly, sodium nitroprusside has not been tested for effects on fertility. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Pregnancy:</span></span> Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy Category C. </p>
<p>There are no adequate, well-controlled studies of NITROPRESS in either laboratory animals or pregnant women. It is not known whether NITROPRESS can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. NITROPRESS should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. </p>
<p>Nonteratogenic effects: In three studies in pregnant ewes, nitroprusside was shown to cross the placental barrier. Fetal cyanide levels were shown to be dose-related to maternal levels of nitroprusside. The metabolic transformation of sodium nitroprusside given to pregnant ewes led to fatal levels of cyanide in the fetuses. The infusion of 25 mcg/kg/min of sodium nitroprusside for one hour in pregnant ewes resulted in the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> of all fetuses. Pregnant ewes infused with 1 mcg/kg/min of sodium nitroprusside for one hour delivered normal lambs. </p>
<p>According to one investigator, a pregnant woman at 24 weeks gestation was given sodium nitroprusside to control gestational <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319826" conceptname="Secondary hypertension">hypertension secondary</span> to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319843" conceptname="Mitral valve disorder">mitral valve disease</span>. Sodium nitroprusside was infused at 3.9 mcg/kg/min for a total of 3.5 mg/kg over 15 hours prior to delivery of a 478 gram stillborn infant without any obvious anomalies. Cyanide levels in the fetal liver were less than 10 mcg/mL. Toxic levels have been reported to be more than 30-40 mcg/mL. The mother demonstrated no cyanide toxicity. </p>
<p>The effects of administering sodium thiosulfate in pregnancy, either by itself or as a co-infusion with sodium nitroprusside, are completely unknown. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Nursing Mothers: </span></span>It is not known whether sodium nitroprusside and its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from sodium nitroprusside, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Pediatric Use:</span></span> Efficacy in the pediatric population was established based on adult trials and supported by the dose-ranging trial (Study 1) and an open label trial of at least 12 hour infusion at a rate that achieved adequate MAP control (Study 2) with pediatric patients on sodium nitroprusside. No novel safety issues were seen in these studies in pediatric patients.

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">The most important adverse reactions to sodium nitroprusside are the avoidable ones of excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> and cyanide toxicity, described above under <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics"><a href="#c9bbd412-795d-4a28-9a7e-87582b59d46a">WARNINGS</a></span></span></span>. The adverse reactions described in this section develop less rapidly and, as it happens, less commonly. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">Methemoglobinemia</span>: </span></span>As described in <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics"><a href="#fa1687de-d7fa-489d-83e0-5ceb3799b8c6">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span></span></span> above, sodium nitroprusside infusions can cause sequestration of hemoglobin as methemoglobin. The back-conversion process is normally rapid, and clinically significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">methemoglobinemia</span> (&gt;10%) is seen only rarely in patients receiving NITROPRESS. Even patients congenitally incapable of back-converting methemoglobin should demonstrate 10% <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">methemoglobinemia</span> only after they have received about 10 mg/kg of sodium nitroprusside, and a patient receiving sodium nitroprusside at the maximum recommended rate (10Â mcg/kg/min) would take over 16 hours to reach this total accumulated dose. </p>
<p>Methemoglobin levels can be measured by most clinical laboratories. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who have received &gt;10 mg/kg of sodium nitroprusside and who exhibit signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span> and adequate arterial pO<span class="Sub">2</span>. Classically, methemoglobinemic blood is described as chocolate brown, without color change on exposure to air. </p>
<p>When <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">methemoglobinemia</span> is diagnosed, the treatment of choice is 1-2 mg/kg of methylene blue, administered intravenously over several minutes. In patients likely to have substantial amounts of cyanide bound to methemoglobin as cyanmethemoglobin, treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">methemoglobinemia</span> with methylene blue must be undertaken with extreme caution. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Thiocyanate Toxicity:</span></span> As described in <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics"><a href="#fa1687de-d7fa-489d-83e0-5ceb3799b8c6">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span></span></span> above, most of the cyanide produced during metabolism of sodium nitroprusside is eliminated in the form of thiocyanate. When cyanide elimination is accelerated by the co-infusion of thiosulfate, thiocyanate production is increased. </p>
<p>Thiocyanate is mildly neurotoxic (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377575" conceptname="Tinnitus">tinnitus</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435279" conceptname="Tonic pupillary reaction">miosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4313132" conceptname="Hyperreflexia">hyperreflexia</span>) at serum levels of 1 mmol/L (60Â mg/L). Thiocyanate toxicity is life-threatening when levels are 3 or 4 times higher (200 mg/L). </p>
<p>The steady-state thiocyanate level after prolonged infusions of sodium nitroprusside is increased with increased infusion rate, and the half-time of accumulation is 3-4 days. To keep the steady-state thiocyanate level below 1 mmol/L, a prolonged infusion of sodium nitroprusside should not be more rapid than 3Â mcg/kg/min; in anuric patients, the corresponding limit is just 1 mcg/kg/min. When prolonged infusions are more rapid than these, thiocyanate levels should be measured daily. </p>
<p>Physiologic maneuvers (<span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">e.g.,</span></span> those that alter the pH of the urine) are not known to increase the elimination of thiocyanate. Thiocyanate clearance rates during dialysis, on the other hand, can approach the blood flow rate of the dialyzer. </p>
<p>Thiocyanate interferes with iodine uptake by the thyroid. </p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Overdosage of nitroprusside can be manifested as excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> or cyanide toxicity (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics"><a href="#c9bbd412-795d-4a28-9a7e-87582b59d46a">WARNINGS</a></span></span></span>) or as thiocyanate toxicity (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Italics"><a href="#f6d5e792-db1d-44d2-adf1-e5e48c2b6662">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span></span></span>). </p>
<p>The acute intravenous mean lethal doses (LD<span class="Sub">50</span>) of nitroprusside in rabbits, dogs, mice, and rats are 2.8,Â 5.0, 8.4, and 11.2 mg/kg, respectively. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Treatment of cyanide toxicity:</span></span> Cyanide levels can be measured by many laboratories, and blood-gas studies that can detect venous hyperoxemia or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidosis</span> are widely available. <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">Acidosis</span> may not appear until more than an hour after the appearance of dangerous cyanide levels, and laboratory tests should not be awaited. Reasonable suspicion of cyanide toxicity is adequate grounds for initiation of treatment.</span></span></p>
<p>Treatment of cyanide toxicity consists of </p>
<ul>
<li>discontinuing the administration of sodium nitroprusside; </li>
<li>providing a buffer for cyanide by using sodium nitrite to convert as much hemoglobin into methemoglobin as the patient can safely tolerate; and then </li>
<li>infusing sodium thiosulfate in sufficient quantity to convert the cyanide into thiocyanate. </li>
</ul>
<p>The necessary medications for this treatment are contained in commercially available Cyanide Antidote Kits. Alternatively, discrete stocks of medications can be used. </p>
<p>Hemodialysis is ineffective in removal of cyanide, but it will eliminate most thiocyanate. </p>
<p>Cyanide Antidote Kits contain both amyl nitrite and sodium nitrite for induction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">methemoglobinemia</span>. The amyl nitrite is supplied in the form of inhalant ampoules, for administration in environments where intravenous administration of sodium nitrite may be delayed. In a patient who already has a patent intravenous line, use of amyl nitrite confers no benefit that is not provided by infusion of sodium nitrite. </p>
<p>Sodium nitrite is available in a 3% solution, and 4-6 mg/kg (about 0.2 mL/kg) should be injected over 2-4Â minutes. This dose can be expected to convert about 10% of the patientâ€™s hemoglobin into methemoglobin; this level of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">methemoglobinemia</span> is not associated with any important hazard of its own. The nitrite infusion may cause transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4237053" conceptname="Vasodilatation">vasodilatation</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, and this <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> must, if it occurs, be routinely managed. </p>
<p>Immediately after infusion of the sodium nitrite, sodium thiosulfate should be infused. This agent is available in 10% and 25% solutions, and the recommended dose is 150-200 mg/kg; a typical adult dose is 50Â mL of the 25% solution. Thiosulfate treatment of an acutely cyanide-toxic patient will raise thiocyanate levels, but not to a dangerous degree. </p>
<p>The nitrite/thiosulfate regimen may be repeated, at half the original doses, after two hours. </p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Dilution to proper strength for infusion:</span></span> Depending on the desired concentration, the solution containing 50 mg of NITROPRESS must be further diluted in 250-1000 mL of sterile 5% dextrose injection. The diluted solution should be protected from light, using the supplied opaque sleeve, aluminum foil, or other opaque material. It is not necessary to cover the infusion drip chamber or the tubing.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Verification of the chemical integrity of the product:</span></span> Sodium nitroprusside solution can be inactivated by reactions with trace contaminants. The products of these reactions are often blue, green, or red, much brighter than the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">faint</span> brownish color of unreacted NITROPRESS. Discolored solutions, or solutions in which particulate matter is visible, should not be used. If properly protected from light, the freshly diluted solution is stable for 24 hours. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">No other drugs should be administered in the same solution with sodium nitroprusside. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Avoidance of excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>:</span></span> While the average effective rate in adult and pediatric patients is about 3 mcg/kg/min, some patients will become dangerously hypotensive when they receive NITROPRESS at this rate. Infusion of sodium nitroprusside should therefore be started at a very low rate (0.3 mcg/kg/min), with upward titration every few minutes until the desired effect is achieved or the maximum recommended infusion rate (10 mcg/kg/min) has been reached. </p>
<p>Because sodium nitroprussideâ€™s hypotensive effect is very rapid in onset and in dissipation, small variations in infusion rate can lead to wide, undesirable variations in blood pressure. Since there is inherent variation in blood pressure measurement, confirm the drug effect at any infusion rate after an additional 5Â minutes before titrating to a higher dose to achieve the desired blood pressure. <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Sodium nitroprusside should not be infused through ordinary I.V. apparatus, regulated only by gravity and mechanical clamps. Only an infusion pump, preferably a volumetric pump, should be used. </span></span></p>
<p>Because sodium nitroprusside can induce essentially unlimited blood-pressure reduction, <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">the blood pressure of a patient receiving this drug must be continuously monitored,</span></span> using either a continually reinflated sphygmomanometer or (preferably) an intra-arterial pressure sensor. Special caution should be used in elderly patients, since they may be more sensitive to the hypotensive effects of the drug. </p>
<p>When sodium nitroprusside is used in the treatment of acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>, titration of the infusion rate must be guided by the results of invasive hemodynamic monitoring with simultaneous monitoring of urine output. Sodium nitroprusside can be titrated by increasing the infusion rate until:</p>
<ul>
<li>measured <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span> is no longer increasing, </li>
<li>systemic blood pressure cannot be further reduced without compromising the perfusion of vital organs, or </li>
<li>the maximum recommended infusion rate has been reached, whichever comes earliest. Specific hemodynamic goals must be tailored to the clinical situation, but improvements in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span> and left ventricular filling pressure must not be purchased at the price of undue <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> and consequent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4131044" conceptname="Hypoperfusion">hypoperfusion</span>. </li>
</ul>
<p>Table 2 below shows the infusion rates corresponding to the recommended initial and maximal doses (0.3 mcg/kg/min and 10 mcg/kg/min, respectively) for both adult and pediatric patients of various weights. This infusion rate may be lower than indicated in the table for patients less than 10 kg. Â Note that when the concentration used in a given patient is changed, the tubing is still filled with a solution at the previous concentration. </p>

In one study, sodium thiosulfate appeared to potentiate the hypotensive effects of sodium nitroprusside. </p>
<p>Co-infusions of sodium thiosulfate have been administered at rates of 5-10 times that of sodium nitroprusside.
