<p>Diflunisal is a stable, white, crystalline compound with a melting point of 211° to 213°C. It is practically insoluble in water at neutral or acidic pH. Because it is an organic acid, it dissolves readily in dilute alkali to give a moderately stable solution at room temperature. It is soluble in most organic solvents including ethanol, methanol, and acetone.</p>
<p>Each tablet, for oral administration, contains 500 mg diflunisal. In addition, each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: croscarmellose sodium, FD&amp;C Blue #2 aluminum lake, hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, pregelatinized starch, propylene glycol, sodium stearyl fumarate, and titanium dioxide.</p>

<h2>Action</h2>
<p class="First">Diflunisal is a non-steroidal drug with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties. It is a peripherally-acting non-narcotic analgesic drug. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4036424" conceptname="Drug tolerance">Habituation</span>, tolerance, and addiction have not been reported.</p>
<p>Diflunisal is a difluorophenyl derivative of salicylic acid. Chemically, diflunisal differs from aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) in two respects. The first of these two is the presence of a difluorophenyl substituent at carbon 1. The second difference is the removal of the -acetyl group from the carbon 4 position. Diflunisal is not metabolized to salicylic acid, and the fluorine atoms are not displaced from the difluorophenyl ring structure.
                                    <span class="Italics">O</span></p>
<p>The precise mechanism of the analgesic and anti-inflammatory actions of diflunisal is not known. Diflunisal is a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor. In animals, prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>. Since prostaglandins are known to be among the mediators of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span>, the mode of action of diflunisal may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</h2>
<p class="First">Diflunisal is rapidly and completely absorbed following oral administration with peak plasma concentrations occurring between 2 to 3 hours. The drug is excreted in the urine as two soluble glucuronide conjugates accounting for about 90% of the administered dose. Little or no diflunisal is excreted in the feces. Diflunisal appears in human milk in concentrations of 2 to 7% of those in plasma. More than 99% of diflunisal in plasma is bound to proteins.</p>
<p>As is the case with salicylic acid, concentration-dependent pharmacokinetics prevail when diflunisal is administered; a doubling of dosage produces a greater than doubling of drug accumulation. The effect becomes more apparent with repetitive doses. Following single doses, peak plasma concentrations of 41 ± 11 mcg/mL (mean ± S.D.) were observed following 250 mg doses, 87 ± 17 mcg/mL were observed following 500 mg and 124 ± 11 mcg/mL following single 1000 mg doses. However, following administration of 250 mg b.i.d., a mean peak level of 56 ± 14 mcg/mL was observed on day 8, while the mean peak level after 500 mg b.i.d. for 11 days was 190 ± 33 mcg/mL. In contrast to salicylic acid which has a plasma half-life of 2 1/2 hours, the plasma half-life of diflunisal is 3 to 4 times longer (8 to 12 hours), because of a difluorophenyl substituent at carbon 1. Because of its long half-life and nonlinear pharmacokinetics, several days are required for diflunisal plasma levels to reach steady state following multiple doses. For this reason, an initial loading dose is necessary to shorten the time to reach steady-state levels, and 2 to 3 days of observation are necessary for evaluating changes in treatment regimens if a loading dose is not used.</p>
<p>Studies in baboons to determine passage across the blood-brain barrier have shown that only small quantities of diflunisal, under normal or acidotic conditions are transported into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The ratio of blood/CSF concentrations after intravenous doses of 50 mg/kg or oral doses of 100 mg/kg of diflunisal was 100:1. In contrast, oral doses of 500 mg/kg of aspirin resulted in a blood/CSF ratio of 5:1.</p>

<h2>Mild to Moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">Pain</span></h2>
<p class="First">Diflunisal is a peripherally-acting analgesic agent with a long duration of action. Diflunisal produces significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> within 1 hour and maximum <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> within 2 to 3 hours.</p>
<p>Consistent with its long half-life, clinical effects of diflunisal mirror its pharmacokinetic behavior, which is the basis for recommending a loading dose when instituting therapy. Patients treated with diflunisal, on the first dose, tend to have a slower onset of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relief when compared with drugs achieving comparable peak effects. However, diflunisal produces longer lasting responses than the comparative agents.</p>
<p>Comparative single dose clinical studies have established the analgesic efficacy of diflunisal at various dose levels relative to other analgesics. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">Analgesic effect</span> measurements were derived from hourly evaluations by patients during eight and twelve hour postdosing observation periods. The following information may serve as a guide for prescribing diflunisal.</p>
<p>Diflunisal 500 mg was comparable in analgesic efficacy to aspirin 650 mg, acetaminophen 600 mg or 650 mg, and acetaminophen 650 mg with propoxyphene napsylate 100 mg. Patients treated with diflunisal had longer lasting responses than the patients treated with the comparative analgesics.</p>
<p>Diflunisal 1000 mg was comparable in analgesic efficacy to acetaminophen 600 mg with codeine 60 mg. Patients treated with diflunisal had longer lasting responses than the patients who received acetaminophen with codeine.</p>
<p>A loading dose of 1000 mg provides faster onset of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relief, shorter time to peak <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span>, and greater peak <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span> than an initial 500 mg dose.</p>
<p>In contrast to the comparative analgesics, a significantly greater proportion of patients treated with diflunisal did not remedicate and continued to have a good <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span> eight to twelve hours after dosing. Seventy-five percent (75%) of patients treated with diflunisal continued to have a good analgesic response at four hours. When patients having a good analgesic response at four hours were followed, 78% of these patients continued to have a good analgesic response at eight hours and 64% at twelve hours.</p>

<p class="First">The effectiveness of diflunisal for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80180" conceptname="Osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</span> was studied in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80180" conceptname="Osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</span> of the hip and/or knee. The activity of diflunisal was demonstrated by clinical improvement in the signs and symptoms of disease activity.</p>
<p>In a double-blind multicenter study of 12 weeks' duration in which dosages were adjusted according to patient response, diflunisal 500 or 750 mg daily was shown to be comparable in effectiveness to aspirin 2000 or 3000 mg daily. In open-label extensions of this study to 24 or 48 weeks, diflunisal continued to show similar effectiveness and generally was well tolerated.</p>

<p class="First">In controlled clinical trials, the effectiveness of diflunisal was established for both acute exacerbations and long-term management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span>. The activity of diflunisal was demonstrated by clinical improvement in the signs and symptoms of disease activity.</p>
<p>In a double-blind multicenter study of 12 weeks' duration in which dosages were adjusted according to patient response, diflunisal 500 or 750 mg daily was comparable in effectiveness to aspirin 2600 or 3900 mg daily. In open-label extensions of this study to 52 weeks, diflunisal continued to be effective and was generally well tolerated.</p>
<p>Diflunisal 500, 750, or 1000 mg daily was compared with aspirin 2000, 3000, or 4000 mg daily in a multicenter study of 8 weeks' duration in which dosages were adjusted according to patient response. In this study, diflunisal was comparable in efficacy to aspirin.</p>
<p>In a double-blind multicenter study of 12 weeks' duration in which dosages were adjusted according to patient needs, diflunisal 500 or 750 mg daily and ibuprofen 1600 or 2400 mg daily were comparable in effectiveness and tolerability.</p>
<p>In a double-blind multicenter study of 12 weeks' duration, diflunisal 750 mg daily was comparable in efficacy to naproxen 750 mg daily. The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377575" conceptname="Tinnitus">tinnitus</span> was comparable for both drugs. This study was extended to 48 weeks on an open-label basis. Diflunisal continued to be effective and generally well tolerated.</p>
<p>In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span>, diflunisal and gold salts may be used in combination at their usual dosage levels.

<h2>Antipyretic Activity</h2>
<p class="First">Diflunisal tablets are not recommended for use as an antipyretic agent. In single 250 mg, 500 mg, or 750 mg doses, diflunisal produced measurable but not clinically useful decreases in temperature in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>; however, the possibility that it may mask <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span> in some patients, particularly with chronic or high doses, should be considered.</p>

<h2>Uricosuric Effect</h2>
<p class="First">In normal volunteers, an increase in the renal clearance of uric acid and a decrease in serum uric acid was observed when diflunisal was administered at 500 mg or 750 mg daily in divided doses. Patients on long-term therapy taking diflunisal at 500 mg to 1000 mg daily in divided doses showed a prompt and consistent reduction across studies in mean serum uric acid levels, which were lowered as much as 1.4 mg%. It is not known whether diflunisal interferes with the activity of other uricosuric agents.</p>

<h2>Effect on Platelet Function</h2>
<p class="First">As an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthetase, diflunisal has a dose-related effect on platelet function and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4219104" conceptname="Bleeding time">bleeding time</span>. In normal volunteers, 250 mg b.i.d. for 8 days had no effect on platelet function, and 500 mg b.i.d., the usual recommended dose, had a slight effect. At 1000 mg b.i.d., which exceeds the maximum recommended dosage, however, diflunisal inhibited platelet function. In contrast to aspirin, these effects of diflunisal were reversible, because of the absence of the chemically labile and biologically reactive -acetyl group at the carbon 4 position. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4219104" conceptname="Bleeding time">Bleeding time</span> was not altered by a dose of 250 mg b.i.d., and was only slightly increased at 500 mg b.i.d. At 1000 mg b.i.d., a greater increase occurred, but was not statistically significantly different from the change in the placebo group.

<h2>Effect on Fecal Blood Loss</h2>
<p class="First">When diflunisal was given to normal volunteers at the usual recommended dose of 500 mg twice daily, fecal blood loss was not significantly different from placebo. Aspirin at 1000 mg four times daily produced the expected increase in fecal blood loss. Diflunisal at 1000 mg twice daily (NOTE: exceeds the recommended dosage) caused a statistically significant increase in fecal blood loss, but this increase was only one-half as large as that associated with aspirin 1300 mg twice daily.</p>

<h3>Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</h3>
<p class="First">Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</p>

<h2>Gastrointestinal Effects – Risk of Ulceration, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">Bleeding</span> and Perforation</h2>
<p class="First">NSAIDs, including diflunisal tablets, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcers</span>, gross <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2 to 4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk.</p>
<p>NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcer</span> disease or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">gastrointestinal bleeding</span>. Patients with a who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10 fold increased risk for developing a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">GI bleed</span> compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.
                                    <span class="Italics">prior history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4027663" conceptname="Peptic ulcer">peptic ulcer disease</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">gastrointestinal bleeding</span></span></p>
<p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.</p>

Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, patients who are volume depleted, and the elderly.

<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">Because serious GI tract ulcerations and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>.

<h3>ACE-inhibitors and Angiotensin II Anagonists</h3>
<p class="First">Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists. These interactions should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin II antagonists. In some patients with compromised renal function, the coadministration of an NSAID and an ACE-inhibitor or an angiotensin II antagonist may result in further deterioration of renal function, including possible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span>, which is usually reversible.</p>
</div>

<h3>Acetaminophen</h3>
<p class="First">In normal volunteers, concomitant administration of diflunisal and acetaminophen resulted in an approximate 50% increase in plasma levels of acetaminophen. Acetaminophen had no effect on plasma levels of diflunisal. Since acetaminophen in high doses has been associated with hepatotoxicity, concomitant administration of diflunisal tablets and acetaminophen should be used cautiously, with careful monitoring of patients.</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of diflunisal and acetaminophen in dogs, but not in rats, at approximately 2 times the recommended maximum human therapeutic dose of each (40 to 52 mg/kg/day of diflunisal/acetaminophen), resulted in greater <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197596" conceptname="Toxic gastroenteritis">gastrointestinal toxicity</span> than when either drug was administered alone. The clinical significance of these findings has not been established.</p>

<h3>Antacids</h3>
<p class="First">Concomitant administration of antacids may reduce plasma levels of diflunisal. This effect is small with occasional doses of antacids, but may be clinically significant when antacids are used on a continuous schedule.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">

<h3>Aspirin</h3>
<p class="First">When diflunisal is administered with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free diflunisal is not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of diflunisal tablets and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.</p>
<p>In normal volunteers, a small decrease in diflunisal levels was observed when multiple doses of diflunisal and aspirin were administered concomitantly.</p>

<h3>Cyclosporine</h3>
<p class="First">Administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs concomitantly with cyclosporine has been associated with an increase in cyclosporine-induced toxicity, possibly due to decreased synthesis of renal prostacyclin. NSAIDs should be used with caution in patients taking cyclosporine, and renal function should be carefully monitored.</p>

<h3>Diuretics</h3>
<p class="First">Clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations, have shown that diflunisal can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.</p>
<p>In normal volunteers, concomitant administration of diflunisal and hydrochlorothiazide resulted in significantly increased plasma levels of hydrochlorothiazide. Diflunisal decreased the hyperuricemic effect of hydrochlorothiazide. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> (see , ), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.

<h3>Lithium</h3>
<p class="First">NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium toxicity</span>.</p>

<h3>Methotrexate</h3>
<p class="First">NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.</p>
</div>

<h3>NSAIDs</h3>
<p class="First">The administration of diflunisal to normal volunteers receiving indomethacin decreased the renal clearance and significantly increased the plasma levels of indomethacin. In some patients the combined use of indomethacin and diflunisal has been associated with fatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">gastrointestinal hemorrhage</span>. Therefore, indomethacin and diflunisal tablets should not be used concomitantly.</p>
<p>The concomitant use of diflunisal tablets and other NSAIDs is not recommended due to the increased possibility of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197596" conceptname="Toxic gastroenteritis">gastrointestinal toxicity</span>, with little or no increase in efficacy. The following information was obtained from studies in normal volunteers.</p>

<h4>Sulindac</h4>
<p class="First">The concomitant administration of diflunisal and sulindac in normal volunteers resulted in lowering of the plasma levels of the active sulindac sulfide metabolite by approximately one-third.</p>

<h4>Naproxen</h4>
<p class="First">The concomitant administration of diflunisal and naproxen in normal volunteers had no effect on the plasma levels of naproxen, but significantly decreased the urinary excretion of naproxen and its glucuronide metabolite. Naproxen had no effect on plasma levels of diflunisal.</p>

<h2>Oral Anticoagulants</h2>
<p class="First">In some normal volunteers, the concomitant administration of diflunisal and warfarin, acenocoumarol, or phenprocoumon resulted in prolongation of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time. This may occur because diflunisal competitively displaces coumarins from protein binding sites. Accordingly, when diflunisal tablets are administered with oral anticoagulants, the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time should be closely monitored during and for several days after concomitant drug administration. Adjustment of dosage of oral anticoagulants may be required. The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> higher than users of either drug alone.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Diflunisal did not affect the type or incidence of neoplasia in a 105 week study in the rat given doses up to 40 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 1.3 times the maximum recommended human dose), or in long-term carcinogenic studies in mice given diflunisal at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 2.7 times the maximum recommended human dose). It was concluded that there was no carcinogenic potential for diflunisal.</p>
<p>Diflunisal passes the placental barrier to a minor degree in the rat. Diflunisal had no mutagenic activity after oral administration in the dominant lethal assay, in the Ames microbial mutagen test or in the V-79 Chinese hamster lung cell assay.</p>
<p>No evidence of impaired fertility was found in reproduction studies in rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day.</p>

<h4>Pregnancy category C</h4>
<p class="First">A dose of 60 mg/kg/day of diflunisal (equivalent to two times the maximum human dose) was maternotoxic, embryotoxic, and teratogenic in rabbits. In three of six studies in rabbits, evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> was observed at doses ranging from 40 to 50 mg/kg/day. Teratology studies in mice, at doses up to 45 mg/kg/day, and in rats at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day, revealed no harm to the fetus due to diflunisal. Aspirin and other salicylates have been shown to be teratogenic in a wide variety of species, including the rat and rabbit, at doses ranging from 50 to 400 mg/kg/day (approximately one to eight times the human dose). Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. There are no adequate and well controlled studies with diflunisal in pregnant women. Diflunisal tablets should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<h3>Nonteratogenic Effects</h3>
<p class="First">Because of the known effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of ductus arteriosus), use during pregnancy (particularly late pregnancy) should be avoided.</p>
<p>The known effects of drugs of this class on the human fetus during the third trimester of pregnancy include: constriction of the ductus arteriosus prenatally, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4006971" conceptname="Tricuspid valve regurgitation">tricuspid incompetence</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322024" conceptname="Pulmonary hypertension">pulmonary hypertension</span>; non-closure of the ductus arteriosus postnatally which may be resistant to medical management; myocardial degenerative changes, platelet dysfunction with resultant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, intracranial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, renal dysfunction or failure, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4220631" conceptname="Injury of kidney">renal injury</span>/dysgenesis which may result in prolonged or permanent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">gastrointestinal bleeding</span> or perforation, and increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201957" conceptname="Necrotizing enterocolitis in fetus OR newborn">necrotizing enterocolitis</span>.</p>
<p>In rats at a dose of one and one-half times the maximum human dose, there was an increase in the average length of gestation. Similar increases in the length of gestation have been observed with aspirin, indomethacin, and phenylbutazone, and may be related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthetase.</p>

<h2>Labor and Delivery</h2>
<p class="First">In rat studies with NSAIDs, as with other drugs known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, an increased incidence of dystocia, delayed parturition, and decreased pup survival occurred. The effects of diflunisal tablets on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Diflunisal is excreted in human milk in concentrations of 2 to 7% of those in plasma. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from diflunisal, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of diflunisal in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Use of diflunisal tablets in pediatric patients below the age of 12 is not recommended.</p>
<p>The adverse effects observed following diflunisal administration to neonatal animals appear to be species, age, and dose-dependent. At dose levels approximately 3 times the usual human therapeutic dose, both aspirin (200 to 400 mg/kg/day) and diflunisal (80 mg/kg/day) resulted in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438398" conceptname="Leukocytosis">leukocytosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">bilateral cataracts</span> in neonatal (4 to 5-day-old) beagle puppies after 2 to 10 doses.

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Cases of overdosage have occurred and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> have been reported. Most patients recovered without evidence of permanent sequelae. The most common signs and symptoms observed with overdosage were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316814" conceptname="Hyperventilation">hyperventilation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377575" conceptname="Tinnitus">tinnitus</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4011527" conceptname="Spatial disorientation">disorientation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4229897" conceptname="Stupor">stupor</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>. Diminished urine output and cardiorespiratory arrest have also been reported. The lowest dosage of diflunisal at which a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> has been reported was 15 grams without the presence of other drugs. In a mixed drug <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, ingestion of 7.5 grams of diflunisal resulted in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.</p>
<p>In the event of overdosage, the stomach should be emptied by inducing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> or by gastric lavage, and the patient carefully observed and given symptomatic and supportive treatment. Because of the high degree of protein binding, hemodialysis may not be effective.</p>
<p>The oral LD of the drug is 500 mg/kg and 826 mg/kg in female mice and female rats, respectively.

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of diflunisal tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use diflunisal tablets. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see ).
                            <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span></p>
<p>After observing the response to initial therapy with diflunisal tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.</p>
<p>Concentration-dependent pharmacokinetics prevail when diflunisal is administered; a doubling of dosage produces a greater than doubling of drug accumulation. The effect becomes more apparent with repetitive doses.</p>
<p>For mild to moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, an initial dose of 1000 mg followed by 500 mg every 12 hours is recommended for most patients. Following the initial dose, some patients may require 500 mg every 8 hours.</p>
<p>A lower dosage may be appropriate depending on such factors as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> severity, patient response, weight, or advanced age; for example, 500 mg initially, followed by 250 mg every 8 to 12 hours.</p>
<p>For <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80180" conceptname="Osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80809" conceptname="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</span>, the suggested dosage range is 500 mg to 1000 mg daily in two divided doses. The dosage of diflunisal may be increased or decreased according to patient response.</p>
<p>Maintenance doses higher than 1500 mg a day are not recommended.</p>
<p>Tablets should be swallowed whole, not crushed or chewed.</p>
