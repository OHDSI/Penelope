<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Gemfibrozil tablet is a lipid regulating agent which decreases serum triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>, and increases high density lipoprotein (HDL) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>. While modest decreases in total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> may be observed with gemfibrozil tablets therapy, treatment of patients with elevated triglycerides due to Type IV <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432867" conceptname="Hyperlipidemia">hyperlipoproteinemia</span> often results in a rise in LDL-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>. LDL-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> levels in Type IIb patients with elevations of both serum LDL-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> and triglycerides are, in general, minimally affected by gemfibrozil tablets treatment; however, gemfibrozil tablets usually raises HDL-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> significantly in this group. Gemfibrozil tablet increases levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) subfractions HDL<span class="Sub">2</span> and HDL<span class="Sub">3</span>, as well as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4122128" conceptname="Apolipoprotein">apolipoproteins</span> AI and AII. Epidemiological studies have shown that both low HDL-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> and high LDL-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> are independent risk factors for coronary heart disease.</p>
<p>In the primary prevention component of the Helsinki Heart Study (refs. 1,2), in which 4081 male patients between the ages of 40 and 55 were studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion, gemfibrozil tablets therapy was associated with significant reductions in total plasma triglycerides and a significant increase in high density lipoprotein <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>. Moderate reductions in total plasma <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> and low density lipoprotein <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> were observed for the gemfibrozil tablets treatment group as a whole, but the lipid response was heterogeneous, especially among different Fredrickson types. The study involved subjects with serum non-HDL-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> of over 200 mg/dL and no previous history of coronary heart disease. Over the five-year study period, the gemfibrozil tablets group experienced a 1.4% absolute (34% relative) reduction in the rate of serious coronary events (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4317150" conceptname="Sudden cardiac death">sudden cardiac deaths</span> plus fatal and nonfatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarctions</span>) compared to placebo, p=0.04 (see Table I). There was a 37% relative reduction in the rate of nonfatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> compared to placebo, equivalent to a treatment-related difference of 13.1 events per thousand persons. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Deaths</span> from any cause during the double-blind portion of the study totaled 44 (2.2%) in the gemfibrozil tablets randomization group and 43 (2.1%) in the placebo group.</p>

<p>Among Fredrickson types, during the 5-year double-blind portion of the primary prevention component of the Helsinki Heart Study, the greatest reduction in the incidence of serious coronary events occurred in Type IIb patients who had elevations of both LDL-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> and total plasma triglycerides. This subgroup of Type IIb gemfibrozil group patients had a lower mean HDL-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> level at baseline than the Type IIa subgroup that had elevations of LDL-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> and normal plasma triglycerides. The mean increase in HDL-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> among the Type IIb patients in this study was 12.6% compared to placebo. The mean change in LDL-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> among Type IIb patients was -4.1% with gemfibrozil tablets compared to a rise of 3.9% in the placebo subgroup. The Type IIb subjects in the Helsinki Heart Study had 26 fewer coronary events per thousand persons over five years in the gemfibrozil group compared to placebo. The difference in coronary events was substantially greater between gemfibrozil tablets and placebo for that subgroup of patients with the triad of LDL-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> &gt;175 mg/dL (&gt;4.5 mmol), triglycerides &gt;200 mg/dL (&gt;2.2 mmol), and HDL-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> &lt;35 mg/dL (&lt;0.90 mmol) (see Table I).</p>
<p>Further information is available from a 3.5 year (8.5 year cumulative) follow-up of all subjects who had participated in the Helsinki Heart Study. At the completion of the Helsinki Heart Study, subjects could choose to start, stop, or continue to receive gemfibrozil tablets; without knowledge of their own lipid values or double-blind treatment, 60% of patients originally randomized to placebo began therapy with gemfibrozil tablets and 60% of patients originally randomized to gemfibrozil tablets continued medication. After approximately 6.5 years following randomization, all patients were informed of their original treatment group and lipid values during the five years of the double-blind treatment. After further elective changes in gemfibrozil tablets treatment status, 61% of patients in the group originally randomized to gemfibrozil tablets were taking drug; in the group originally randomized to placebo, 65% were taking gemfibrozil tablets. The event rate per 1000 occurring during the open-label follow-up period is detailed in Table II.</p>

<p>It is not clear to what extent the findings of the primary prevention component of the Helsinki Heart Study can be extrapolated to other segments of the dyslipidemic population not studied (such as women, younger or older males, or those with lipid abnormalities limited solely to HDL-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>) or to other lipid-altering drugs.</p>
<p>The secondary prevention component of the Helsinki Heart Study was conducted over five years in parallel and at the same centers in Finland in 628 middle-aged males excluded from the primary prevention component of the Helsinki Heart Study because of a history of angina, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> or unexplained ECG changes (ref. 3). The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was cardiac events (the sum of fatal and non-fatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarctions</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4317150" conceptname="Sudden cardiac death">sudden cardiac deaths</span>). The hazard ratio (gemfibrozil tablets:placebo) for cardiac events was 1.47 (95% confidence limits 0.88-2.48, p=0.14). Of the 35 patients in the gemfibrozil tablets group who experienced cardiac events, 12 patients suffered events after discontinuation from the study. Of the 24 patients in the placebo group with cardiac events, 4 patients suffered events after discontinuation from the study. There were 17 cardiac <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> in the gemfibrozil tablets group and 8 in the placebo group (hazard ratio 2.18; 95% confidence limits 0.94-5.05, p=0.06). Ten of these <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> in the gemfibrozil tablets group and 3 in the placebo group occurred after discontinuation from therapy. In this study of patients with known or suspected coronary heart disease, no benefit from gemfibrozil tablets treatment was observed in reducing cardiac events or cardiac <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span>. Thus, gemfibrozil tablet has shown benefit only in selected dyslipidemic patients <span class="Italics">without</span> suspected or established coronary heart disease. Even in patients with coronary heart disease and the triad of elevated LDL-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>, elevated triglycerides, plus low HDL-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>, the possible effect of gemfibrozil tablets on coronary events has not been adequately studied.</p>
<p>No efficacy in the patients with established coronary heart disease was observed during the Coronary Drug Project with the chemically and pharmacologically related drug, clofibrate. The Coronary Drug Project was a 6-year randomized, double-blind study involving 1000 clofibrate, 1000 nicotinic acid, and 3000 placebo patients with known coronary heart disease. A clinically and statistically significant reduction in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarctions</span> was seen in the concurrent nicotinic acid group compared to placebo; no reduction was seen with clofibrate.</p>
<p>The mechanism of action of gemfibrozil has not been definitely established. In man, gemfibrozil tablet has been shown to inhibit peripheral lipolysis and to decrease the hepatic extraction of free fatty acids, thus reducing hepatic triglyceride production. Gemfibrozil tablet inhibits synthesis and increases clearance of VLDL carrier <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4122128" conceptname="Apolipoprotein">apolipoprotein</span> B, leading to a decrease in VLDL production.</p>
<p>Animal studies suggest that gemfibrozil may, in addition to elevating HDL-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>, reduce incorporation of long-chain fatty acids into newly formed triglycerides, accelerate turnover and removal of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> from the liver, and increase excretion of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> in the feces. Gemfibrozil tablet is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration. Peak plasma levels occur in 1 to 2 hours with a plasma half-life of 1.5 hours following multiple doses. </p>
<p>Gemfibrozil is completely absorbed after oral administration of gemfibrozil tablets, reaching peak plasma concentrations 1 to 2 hours after dosing. Gemfibrozil pharmacokinetics are affected by the timing of meals relative to time of dosing. In one study (ref. 4), both the rate and extent of absorption of the drug were significantly increased when administered 0.5 hour before meals. Average AUC was reduced by 14 - 44% when gemfibrozil tablet was administered after meals compared to 0.5 hour before meals. In a subsequent study (ref. 4), rate of absorption of gemfibrozil tablet was maximum when administered 0.5 hour before meals with the C<span class="Sub">max</span> 50 - 60% greater than when given either with meals or fasting. In this study, there were no significant effects on AUC of timing of dose relative to meals (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p>
<p>Gemfibrozil mainly undergoes oxidation of a ring methyl group to successively form a hydroxymethyl and a carboxyl metabolite. Approximately seventy percent of the administered human dose is excreted in the urine, mostly as the glucuronide conjugate, with less than 2% excreted as unchanged gemfibrozil. Six percent of the dose is accounted for in the feces. Gemfibrozil is highly bound to plasma proteins and there is potential for displacement interactions with other drugs (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>). </p>

Patients who present such risk typically have serum triglycerides over 2000 mg/dL and have elevations of VLDL-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> as well as fasting chylomicrons (Type V <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432867" conceptname="Hyperlipidemia">hyperlipidemia</span>). Subjects who consistently have total serum or plasma triglycerides below 1000 mg/dL are unlikely to present a risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192640" conceptname="Pancreatitis">pancreatitis</span>.

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First">1. Because of chemical, pharmacological, and clinical similarities between gemfibrozil and clofibrate, the adverse findings with clofibrate in two large clinical studies may also apply to gemfibrozil. In the first of those studies, the Coronary Drug Project, 1000 subjects with previous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> were treated for five years with clofibrate. There was no difference in mortality between the clofibrate-treated subjects and 3000 placebo-treated subjects, but twice as many clofibrate-treated subjects developed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4098112" conceptname="Biliary sludge">cholelithiasis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192956" conceptname="Cholecystitis">cholecystitis</span> requiring surgery. In the other study, conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), 5000 subjects without known coronary heart disease were treated with clofibrate for five years and followed one year beyond. There was a statistically significant, 44%, higher age-adjusted total mortality in the clofibrate-treated than in a comparable placebo-treated control group during the trial period. The excess mortality was due to a 33% increase in non-cardiovascular causes, including malignancy, post-cholecystectomy complications, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192640" conceptname="Pancreatitis">pancreatitis</span>. The higher risk of clofibrate-treated subjects for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192353" conceptname="Disorder of gallbladder">gallbladder disease</span> was confirmed.</p>
<p>Because of the more limited size of the Helsinki Heart Study, the observed difference in mortality from any cause between the gemfibrozil tablets and placebo group is not statistically significantly different from the 29% excess mortality reported in the clofibrate group in the separate WHO study at the nine year follow-up (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>). Noncoronary heart disease related mortality showed an excess in the group originally randomized to gemfibrozil tablets primarily due to cancer <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> observed during the open-label extension.</p>
<p>During the five year primary prevention component of the Helsinki Heart Study, mortality from any cause was 44 (2.2%) in the gemfibrozil tablets group and 43 (2.1%) in the placebo group; including the 3.5 year follow-up period since the trial was completed, cumulative mortality from any cause was 101 (4.9%) in the gemfibrozil tablets group and 83 (4.1%) in the group originally randomized to placebo (hazard ratio 1:20 in favor of placebo). Because of the more limited size of the Helsinki Heart Study, the observed difference in mortality from any cause between the gemfibrozil tablets and placebo groups at Year-5 or at Year-8.5 is not statistically significantly different from the 29% excess mortality reported in the clofibrate group in the separate WHO study at the nine year follow-up. Noncoronary heart disease related mortality showed an excess in the group originally randomized to gemfibrozil tablets at the 8.5 year follow-up (65 gemfibrozil tablets versus 45 placebo noncoronary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span>).</p>
<p>The incidence of cancer (excluding basal cell carcinoma) discovered during the trial and in the 3.5 years after the trial was completed was 51 (2.5%) in both originally randomized groups. In addition, there were 16 basal cell carcinomas in the group originally randomized to gemfibrozil tablets and 9 in the group randomized to placebo (p=0.22). There were 30 (1.5%) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> attributed to cancer in the group originally randomized to gemfibrozil tablets and 18 (0.9%) in the group originally randomized to placebo (p=0.11). Adverse outcomes, including coronary events, were higher in gemfibrozil patients in a corresponding study in men with a history of known or suspected coronary heart disease in the secondary prevention component of the Helsinki Heart Study (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>).</p>
<p>A comparative carcinogenicity study was also done in rats comparing three drugs in this class: fenofibrate (10 and 60 mg/kg; 0.3 and 1.6 times the human dose), clofibrate (400 mg/kg; 1.6 times the human dose), and gemfibrozil (250 mg/kg; 1.7 times the human dose). Pancreatic acinar <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> were increased in males and females on fenofibrate; hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic acinar <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> were increased in males and hepatic neoplastic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4101098" conceptname="Nodule">nodules</span> in females treated with clofibrate; hepatic neoplastic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4101098" conceptname="Nodule">nodules</span> were increased in males and females treated with clofibrate; hepatic neoplastic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4101098" conceptname="Nodule">nodules</span> were increased in males and females treated with gemfibrozil while testicular interstitial cell (Leydig cell) tumors were increased in males on all three drugs.</p>
<p>2. A gallstone prevalence substudy of 450 Helsinki Heart Study participants showed a trend toward a greater prevalence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196456" conceptname="Gallstone">gallstones</span> during the study within the gemfibrozil tablets treatment group (7.5% vs. 4.9% for the placebo group, a 55% excess for the gemfibrozil group). A trend toward a greater incidence of gallbladder surgery was observed for the gemfibrozil tablets group (17 vs. 11 subjects, a 54% excess). This result did not differ statistically from the increased incidence of cholecystectomy observed in the WHO study in the group treated with clofibrate. Both clofibrate and gemfibrozil may increase <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> excretion into the bile leading to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4098112" conceptname="Biliary sludge">cholelithiasis</span>. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4098112" conceptname="Biliary sludge">cholelithiasis</span> is suspected, gallbladder studies are indicated. Gemfibrozil tablets therapy should be discontinued if <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196456" conceptname="Gallstone">gallstones</span> are found. Cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4098112" conceptname="Biliary sludge">cholelithiasis</span> have been reported with gemfibrozil therapy (ref. 7).</p>
<p>3. Since a reduction of mortality from coronary heart disease has not been demonstrated and because liver and interstitial cell testicular tumors were increased in rats, gemfibrozil tablets should be administered only to those patients described in the <span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</span> section. If a significant serum lipid response is not obtained, gemfibrozil tablets should be discontinued.</p>
<p>4. Concomitant Anticoagulants - Caution should be exercised when anticoagulants are given in conjunction with gemfibrozil tablets. The dosage of the anticoagulant should be reduced to maintain the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time at the desired level to prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> complications. Frequent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> determinations are advisable until it has been definitely determined that the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> level has stabilized.</p>
<p>5. Concomitant therapy with gemfibrozil tablets and an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is associated with an increased risk of skeletal muscle toxicity manifested as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4230337" conceptname="Rhabdomyolysis">rhabdomyolysis</span>, markedly elevated creatine kinase (CPK) levels and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439142" conceptname="Myoglobinuria">myoglobinuria</span>, leading in a high proportion of cases to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. 
<span class="Bold">Because of an observed marked increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137275" conceptname="Disorder of muscle">myopathy</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4230337" conceptname="Rhabdomyolysis">rhabdomyolysis</span>, the specific combination of gemfibrozil and cerivastatin is absolutely contraindicated (see </span><span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class="Bold">).
</span>
IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE HAD AN UNSATISFACTORY LIPID RESPONSE TO EITHER DRUG ALONE, THE BENEFIT OF COMBINED THERAPY WITH GEMFIBROZIL TABLETS AND HMG-CoA REDUCTASE INHIBITORS OTHER THAN CERIVASTATIN DOES NOT OUTWEIGH THE RISKS OF SEVERE <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137275" conceptname="Disorder of muscle">MYOPATHY</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4230337" conceptname="Rhabdomyolysis">RHABDOMYOLYSIS</span>, AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">ACUTE RENAL FAILURE</span> (refs. 8, 9, 10, 11)(see <span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span>).

<h2>1. Initial Therapy</h2>
<p class="First">Laboratory studies should be done to ascertain that the lipid levels are consistently abnormal.

Patients taking repaglinide should not start taking gemfibrozil; patients taking gemfibrozil should not start taking repaglinide. Concomitant use may result in enhanced and prolonged blood glucose-lowering effects of repaglinide. Caution should be used in patients already on repaglinide and gemfibrozil – blood glucose levels should be monitored and repaglinide dose adjustment may be needed. Rare post marketing events of serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> have been reported in patients taking repaglinide and gemfibrozil together.

<h2>4. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Long-term studies have been conducted in rats at 0.2 and 1.3 times the human exposure (based on AUC). The incidence of benign liver <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4101098" conceptname="Nodule">nodules</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201519" conceptname="Primary malignant neoplasm of liver">liver carcinomas</span> was significantly increased in high dose male rats. The incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201519" conceptname="Primary malignant neoplasm of liver">liver carcinomas</span> increased also in low dose males, but this increase was not statistically significant (p=0.1). Male rats had a dose-related and statistically significant increase of benign Leydig cell tumors. The higher dose female rats had a significant increase in the combined incidence of benign and malignant liver neoplasms.</p>
<p>Long-term studies have been conducted in mice at 0.1 and 0.7 times the human exposure (based on AUC). There were no statistically significant differences from controls in the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322895" conceptname="Nodule of liver">liver tumors</span>, but the doses tested were lower than those shown to be carcinogenic with other fibrates.</p>
<p>Electron microscopy studies have demonstrated a florid hepatic peroxisome proliferation following gemfibrozil tablets administration to the male rat. An adequate study to test for peroxisome proliferation has not been done in humans but changes in peroxisome morphology have been observed. Peroxisome proliferation has been shown to occur in humans with either of two other drugs of the fibrate class when liver biopsies were compared before and after treatment in the same individual.</p>
<p>Administration of approximately 2 times the human dose (based on surface area) to male rats for 10 weeks resulted in a dose-related decrease of fertility. Subsequent studies demonstrated that this effect was reversed after a drug-free period of about eight weeks, and it was not transmitted to the offspring.</p>

<h2></h2>
<p class="First">Gemfibrozil tablets has been shown to produce adverse effects in rats and rabbits at doses between 0.5 and 3 times the human dose (based on surface area). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Gemfibrozil tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<p>Administration of gemfibrozil tablets to female rats at 2 times the human dose (based on surface area) before and throughout gestation caused a dose-related decrease in conception rate and, an increase in stillborns and a slight reduction in pup weight during lactation. There were also dose-related increased skeletal variations. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434143" conceptname="Anophthalmos">Anophthalmia</span> occurred, but rarely.</p>
<p>Administration of 0.6 and 2 times the human dose (based on surface area) of gemfibrozil tablets to female rats from gestation day 15 through weaning caused dose-related decreases in birth weight and suppressions of pup growth during lactation.</p>
<p>Administration of 1 and 3 times the human dose (based on surface area) of gemfibrozil tablets to female rabbits during organogenesis caused a dose-related decrease in litter size and, at the high dose, an increased incidence of parietal bone variations.</p>

<h2>6. Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk.

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">In the double-blind controlled phase of the primary prevention component of the Helsinki Heart Study, 2046 patients received gemfibrozil tablets for up to five years. In that study, the following adverse reactions were statistically more frequent in subjects in the gemfibrozil tablets group:</p>

<p><span class="Bold">Gallbladder surgery</span> was performed in 0.9% of gemfibrozil tablets and 0.5% of placebo subjects in the primary prevention component, a 64% excess, which is not statistically different from the excess of gallbladder surgery observed in the clofibrate compared to the placebo group of the WHO study. Gallbladder surgery was also performed more frequently in the gemfibrozil tablets group compared to placebo (1.9% vs. 0.3%, p=0.07) in the secondary prevention component. A statistically significant increase in appendectomy in the gemfibrozil group was seen also in the secondary prevention component (6 on gemfibrozil vs. 0 on placebo, p=0.014).</p>
