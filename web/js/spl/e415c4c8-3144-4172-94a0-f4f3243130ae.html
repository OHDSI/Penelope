<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Targretin<span class="Sup">®</span> (bexarotene) gel 1% contains
                            bexarotene and is intended for topical application only. Bexarotene is a
                            member of a subclass of retinoids that selectively activate retinoid X
                            receptors (RXRs). These retinoid receptors have biologic activity
                            distinct from that of retinoic acid receptors (RARs).</p>
<p>The chemical name is
                            4-[1-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-3,5,5,8,8-pentamethyl-2-naphthalenyl)ethenyl]
                            benzoic acid, and the structural formula is as follows:</p>

<p>Bexarotene is an off-white to white powder with a molecular
                            weight of 348.48 and a molecular formula of
                                C<span class="Sub">24</span>H<span class="Sub">28</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span>. It is insoluble in water
                            and slightly soluble in vegetable oils and ethanol, USP.</p>
<p>Targretin<span class="Sup">®</span> gel is a clear gelled solution
                            containing 1.0% (w/w) bexarotene in a base of dehydrated alcohol, USP,
                            polyethylene glycol 400, NF, hydroxypropyl cellulose, NF, and butylated

<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Bexarotene selectively binds and activates retinoid X
                                    receptor subtypes (RXRα, RXRβ, RXRγ).
                                    RXRs can form heterodimers with various receptor partners such
                                    as retinoic acid receptors (RARs), vitamin D receptor, thyroid
                                    receptor, and peroxisome proliferator activator receptors
                                    (PPARs). Once activated, these receptors function as
                                    transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes that
                                    control cellular differentiation and proliferation. Bexarotene
                                    inhibits the growth <span class="Italics">in
                                    vitro</span> of some tumor cell lines of hematopoietic and
                                    squamous cell origin. It also induces tumor regression <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> in some animal models.

<h3>General</h3>
<p class="First">Plasma concentrations of bexarotene were
                                            determined during clinical studies in patients with CTCL
                                            or following repeated single or multiple-daily dose
                                            applications of Targretin<span class="Sup">®</span> gel 1%
                                            for up to 132 weeks. Plasma bexarotene concentrations
                                            were generally less than 5 ng/mL and did not exceed 55
                                            ng/mL. However, only two patients with very intense
                                            dosing regimens (&gt; 40% BSA lesions and QID
                                            dosing) were sampled. Plasma bexarotene concentrations                                   and the frequency of detecting quantifiable plasma
                                            bexarotene concentrations increased with increasing
                                            percent body surface area treated and increasing
                                            quantity of Targretin<span class="Sup">®</span> gel applied.
                                            The sporadically-observed and generally low plasma
                                            bexarotene concentrations indicated that, in patients
                                            receiving doses of low to moderate intensity, there is a
                                            low potential for significant plasma concentrations
                                            following repeated application of
                                                Targretin<span class="Sup">®</span> gel. Bexarotene is
                                            highly bound (&gt;99%) to plasma proteins. The
                                            plasma proteins to which bexarotene binds have not been
                                            elucidated, and the ability of bexarotene to displace
                                            drugs bound to plasma proteins and the ability of drugs
                                            to displace bexarotene binding have not been studied
                                            (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#S5156F5B3-A1CD-425E-BC5B-59261824866D">PRECAUTIONS: Protein Binding</a></span>). The uptake of bexarotene by organs or
                                            tissues has not been evaluated.</p>

<h3>Metabolism</h3>
<p class="First">Four bexarotene metabolites have been identified
                                            in plasma following oral administration of bexarotene:
                                            6- and 7-hydroxy-bexarotene and 6- and
                                            7-oxo-bexarotene. <span class="Italics">In
                                            vitro</span> studies suggest that cytochrome P450 3A4
                                            is the major cytochrome P450 responsible for formation
                                            of the oxidative metabolites and that the oxidative
                                            metabolites may be glucuronidated. The oxidative
                                            metabolites are active in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> assays of retinoid receptor

                                    at least one therapy.</p>
<p>Patients were treated with Targretin<span class="Sup">®</span>
                                    gel 1% for a planned 16-week period with an option to continue
                                    provided that no unacceptable toxicity was occurring.</p>
<p>Tumor response was assessed in the multicenter study by
                                    observation of up to five baseline-defined index lesions using a
                                    Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Disease Severity (CA). This
                                    endpoint was based on a summation of the grades, for all index
                                    lesions, of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span>, scaling, plaque elevation,
                                    hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation, and area of involvement.
                                    New cutaneous lesions or tumors and extracutaneous disease
                                    manifestations were not considered in response or disease
                                    progression assessments.</p>
<p>All tumor responses required confirmation over at least
                                    two assessments separated by at least four weeks. A partial
                                    response was defined as an improvement of at least 50% in the
                                    index lesions. A complete clinical response required complete
                                    disappearance of the index lesions, but did not require
                                    confirmation by biopsy.</p>
<p>Targretin<span class="Sup">®</span> gel produced an overall
                                    response rate of 26% (13/50) with a corresponding exact 95%
                                    confidence interval from 14.6% to 40.3% by the Composite
                                    Assessment of Index Lesion Severity. For the Stage IA and IB
                                    patients, the response rate was 28% (13/47) with a corresponding
                                    exact 95% confidence interval from 15.6% to 42.6%. For the Stage
                                    II patients the response rate was 0% (0/3). Two percent of
                                    patients (1/50) had a clinical complete response. The median
                                    time to best response on the Composite Assessment of Index
                                    Lesion Severity (n=13) was 85 days (range: 36-154).</p>
<p>The rate of relapse in responding patients by the
                                    Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity was 23% (3/13)                                    over a median observation period of 149 days (range 56-342).
                                    Fourteen patients developed new lesions in untreated areas
                                    (14/50; 28%). Four patients developed clinically abnormal lymph
                                    nodes (≥ 1cm diam) (4/50; 8%). One patient developed a
                                    cutaneous tumor (1/50; 2%).</p>
<p>The Phase I-II program (dose-seeking trials with
                                    different response criteria than the multicenter trial) was
                                    supportive of the multicenter study results.</p>

<h2>Drug-Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Patients who are applying Targretin<span class="Sup">®</span>
                                    gel should not concurrently use products that contain DEET
                                        (<span class="Italics">N,N</span>-diethyl-<span class="Italics">m</span>-toluamide), a common
                                    component of insect repellent products. An animal toxicology
                                    study showed increased DEET toxicity when DEET was included as
                                    part of the formulation.</p>
<p>No formal studies to evaluate drug interactions with
                                    bexarotene have been conducted. Bexarotene oxidative metabolites
                                    appear to be formed through cytochrome P450 3A4.</p>
<p>On the basis of the metabolism of bexarotene by
                                    cytochrome P450 3A4, concomitant ketoconazole, itraconazole,
                                    erythromycin and grapefruit juice could increase bexarotene
                                    plasma concentrations. Similarly, based on data that gemfibrozil    increases bexarotene concentrations following oral bexarotene
                                    administration, concomitant gemfibrozil could increase
                                    bexarotene plasma concentrations. However, due to the low
                                    systemic exposure to bexarotene after low to moderately intense
                                    gel regimens (see Clinical Pharmacology), increases that occur
                                    are unlikely to be of sufficient magnitude to result in adverse
                                    effects.</p>
<p>No drug interaction data are available on concomitant

<p class="First">Long-term studies in animals to assess the carcinogenic
                                    potential of bexarotene have not been conducted. Bexarotene was
                                    not mutagenic to bacteria (Ames assay) or mammalian cells (mouse
                                    <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> assay). Bexarotene was not clastogenic <span class="Italics">in vivo </span>(micronucleus test in
                                    mice). No formal fertility studies were conducted with

<h2>Use in Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">It is not known whether bexarotene is excreted in human
                                    milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because
                                    of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing
                                    infants from bexarotene, a decision should be made whether to
                                    discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into
                                    account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">The safety of Targretin<span class="Sup">®</span> gel has been
                            assessed in clinical studies of 117 patients with CTCL who received
                                Targretin<span class="Sup">®</span> gel for up to 172 weeks. In the
                            multicenter open label study, 50 patients with CTCL received
                                Targretin<span class="Sup">®</span> gel for up to 98 weeks. The mean
                            duration of therapy for these 50 patients was 199 days. The most common
                            adverse events reported with an incidence at the application site of at
                            least 10% in patients with CTCL were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140842" conceptname="Changes in skin texture">skin disorder</span>, and

<p>Adverse events leading to dose reduction or study drug
                            discontinuation in at least two patients were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134438" conceptname="Contact dermatitis">contact dermatitis</span>,

<p>Of the 49 patients (98%) who experienced any adverse event, most
                            experienced events categorized as mild (9 patients, 18%) or moderate (27
                            patients, 54%). There were 12 patients (24%) who experienced at least
                            one moderately severe adverse event. The most common moderately severe
                            events were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> (7 patients, 14%) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span> (3 patients, 6%). Only
                            one patient (2%) experienced a severe adverse event (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>).</p>
<p>In the patients with CTCL receiving
                            Targretin<span class="Sup">®</span> gel, adverse events reported regardless
                            of relationship to study drug at an incidence of ≥5% are
                            presented in Table 1.</p>
<p>A similar safety profile for Targretin<span class="Sup">®</span> gel
                            was demonstrated in the Phase I-II program. For the 67 patients enrolled
                            in the Phase I-II program, the mean duration of treatment was 436 days                      (range 12-1203 days). As in the multicenter study, the most common
                            adverse events regardless of relationship to study drug in the Phase
                            I-II program were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> (78%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> (40%), and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span> (40%).</p>

                            should be increased at weekly intervals to once daily, then twice daily,
                            then three times daily and finally four times daily according to
                            individual lesion tolerance. Generally, patients were able to maintain a
                            dosing frequency of two to four times per day. Most responses were seen
                            at dosing frequencies of two times per day and higher. If application
                            site toxicity occurs, the application frequency can be reduced. Should
                            severe irritation occur, application of drug can be temporarily
                            discontinued for a few days until the symptoms subside. See <a href="#S0E05F7AF-17CD-4494-9E99-62D4D9AD9794">CONTRAINDICATIONS:
                                Pregnancy: Category X</a>.</p>
<p>Sufficient gel should be applied to cover the lesion with a
                            generous coating. The gel should be allowed to dry before covering with
                            clothing. Because unaffected skin may become irritated, application of
                            the gel to normal skin surrounding the lesions should be avoided. In
                            addition, do not apply the gel near mucosal surfaces of the body.</p>
<p>A response may be seen as soon as 4 weeks after initiation of
                            therapy but most patients require longer application. With continued
                            application, further benefit may be attained. The longest onset time for
                            the first response among the responders was 392 days based on the
                            Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity in the multicenter
                                study<span class="Italics">.</span> In clinical trials,
                                Targretin<span class="Sup">®</span> gel was applied for up to 172 weeks.</p>
<p>Targretin<span class="Sup">®</span> gel should be continued as long as
                            the patient is deriving benefit.</p>
