<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Interferon alfacon-1 is a recombinant non-naturally occurring type-I interferon. The 166-amino acid sequence of Interferon alfacon-1 was derived by scanning the sequences of several natural interferon alpha subtypes and assigning the most frequently observed amino acid in each corresponding position.<span class="Sup">1</span> Four additional amino acid changes were made to facilitate the molecular construction, and a corresponding synthetic DNA sequence was constructed using chemical synthesis methodology. Interferon alfacon-1 differs from interferon alfa-2b at 20/166 amino acids (88% homology), and comparison with interferon-beta shows identity at over 30% of the amino acid positions. Interferon alfacon-1 is produced in <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli (E. coli) </span>cells that have been genetically altered by insertion of a synthetically constructed sequence that codes for Interferon alfacon-1. Prior to final purification, Interferon alfacon-1 is allowed to oxidize to its native state, and its final purity is achieved by sequential passage over a series of chromatography columns. This protein has a molecular weight of 19,434 daltons.</p>
<p>INFERGEN is a sterile, clear, colorless, preservative-free liquid formulated with 100 mM sodium chloride and 27 mM sodium phosphate at pH 7.0 ± 0.2. The product is available in single-use vials containing 9 mcg and 15 mcg Interferon alfacon-1 at a fill volume of 0.3 mL and 0.5 mL, respectively. INFERGEN vials contain 0.03 mg/mL Interferon alfacon-1, 5.9 mg/mL sodium chloride, and 3.8 mg/mL sodium phosphate in Water for Injection, USP. INFERGEN is to be administered undiluted by subcutaneous (SC) injection.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-4.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Interferons are a family of naturally occurring, small protein molecules with molecular weights of 15,000 to 21,000 daltons that are produced and secreted by cells in response to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440029" conceptname="Viral disease">viral infections</span> or to various synthetic and biological inducers. Two major classes of interferons have been identified (i.e., type-I and type-II). Type-I interferons include a family of more than 25 alpha interferons as well as beta interferon and omega interferon. While all alpha interferons have similar biological effects, not all the activities are shared by each alpha interferon and, in many cases, the extent of activity varies substantially for each interferon subtype.</p>
<p>All type-I interferons share common biological activities generated by binding of interferon to the cell-surface receptor, leading to the production of several interferon-stimulated gene products. Type-I interferons induce pleiotropic biologic responses which include antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory effects, regulation of cell surface major histocompatibility antigen (HLA class I and class II) expression and regulation of cytokine expression. Examples of interferon-stimulated gene products include 2'5' oligoadenylate synthetase (2'5'OAS) and β-2 microglobulin.</p>
<p>The antiviral, antiproliferative, natural killer (NK) cell activation, and gene-induction activities of INFERGEN have been compared with other recombinant alpha interfereons in <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>assays and have demonstrated similar ranges of activity. INFERGEN exhibited at least 5 times higher specific activity <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>than Interferon alfa-2a and Interferon alfa-2b.<span class="Sup">2</span> Comparison of INFERGEN with a WHO international potency standard for recombinant alpha interferon (83/514) revealed that the specific activity of INFERGEN in both an <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>antiviral cytopathic effect assay and an antiproliferative assay was 1 x 10<span class="Sup">9</span> U/mg. However, correlation between <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>activity and clinical activity of any interferon is unknown.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-4.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">The pharmacokinetic properties of INFERGEN have not been evaluated in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198964" conceptname="Chronic hepatitis C">chronic hepatitis C</span>. Pharmacokinetic profiles were evaluated in normal, healthy volunteer subjects after SC injection of 1, 3, or 9 mcg INFERGEN. Plasma levels of INFERGEN after SC administration of any dose were too low to be detected by either enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or by inhibition of viral cytopathic effect. However, analysis of INFERGEN-induced cellular products (induction of 2'5' OAS and β-2 microglobulin) after treatment in these subjects revealed a statistically significant, dose-related increase in the area under the curve (AUC) for the levels of 2'5' OAS or β-2 microglobulin induced over time (p &lt; 0.001 for all comparisons). Concentrations of 2'5' OAS were maximal at 24 hours after dosing, while serum levels of β-2 microglobulin appeared to reach a maximum 24 to 36 hours after dosing. The dose-response relationships observed for 2'5' OAS and β-2 microglobulin were indicative of biological activity after SC administration of 1 to 9 mcg INFERGEN.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-4.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Preclinical Experience</h2>
<p class="First">All interferons have been shown to be highly species-specific. Antiviral activity of INFERGEN was observed in the rhesus monkey LLC cell line and golden Syrian hamster BHK cell line. Antiviral activity of INFERGEN in the golden Syrian hamster was confirmed further <span class="Italics">in vivo.</span><span class="Sup">3</span> Pharmacokinetic studies of INFERGEN in golden Syrian hamsters and rhesus monkeys demonstrated rapid absorption following SC injection. Peak serum concentrations of INFERGEN were observed at 1 hour and 4 hours in golden Syrian hamsters and in rhesus monkeys, respectively. Subcutaneous bioavailability was high in both species, averaging 99% in golden Syrian hamsters and 83% to 104% in rhesus monkeys. Clearance of INFERGEN, averaging 1.99 mL/minute/kg in golden Syrian hamsters and 0.71 to 0.92 mL/minute/kg in rhesus monkeys, was due predominantly to catabolism and excretion by the kidneys. The terminal half-life of INFERGEN following SC dosing was 1.3 hours in golden Syrian hamsters and 3.4 hours in rhesus monkeys. Upon 7-day multiple SC dosing, no accumulation of serum levels was observed in golden Syrian hamsters.</p>
<p>In preclinical toxicology studies in golden Syrian hamsters and rhesus monkeys, administration of INFERGEN at doses of up to 100 mcg/kg/day was associated with decreased body weight, decreased food consumption, and bone marrow suppression. High-dose chronic exposure at doses of 10 to 100 mcg/kg/day (50- to 500-fold higher than the maximum clinical dose given daily) in rhesus monkeys was not tolerated for greater than 1 month, due to the development of vascular leak syndrome.</p>
<p>Reproductive toxicity studies in pregnant rhesus monkeys and golden Syrian hamsters demonstrated an increase in fetal loss in hamsters treated with INFERGEN at doses of &gt; 150 mcg/kg/day and in rhesus monkeys at doses of 3 and 10 mcg/kg/day. The INFERGEN toxicity profile described is consistent with the known toxicity profile of other alpha interferons.<span class="Sup">4</span></p>

<h1>CLINICAL EXPERIENCE: RESPONSE TO INFERGEN</h1>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-5.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Initial Treatment</h2>
<p class="First">INFERGEN was studied in an open-label dose-escalation study using 3, 6, 9, 12, or 15 mcg administered three times per week (TIW) to patients with compensated liver disease secondary to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198964" conceptname="Chronic hepatitis C">chronic hepatitis C</span> virus (HCV) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>. The 15 mcg dose was the maximum tolerated dose. All doses demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and preliminary evidence of efficacy.</p>
<p>The efficacy of 3 and 9 mcg doses of INFERGEN in the treatment of chronic HCV <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> was examined in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial involving 704 patients previously untreated with alpha interferon.<span class="Sup">5</span> Patients were 18 years or older, had compensated liver disease, tested positive for HCV RNA, and had elevated serum <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4211515" conceptname="Alanine aminotransferase">alanine aminotransferase</span> (ALT) averaging greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal. Staging of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">chronic liver disease</span> was confirmed by a liver biopsy taken within 1 year prior to enrollment. Other causes of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">chronic liver disease</span> were ruled out prior to randomization. Notable exclusion criteria were decompensated liver disease, thyroid abnormality, or history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.</p>
<p>Efficacy of INFERGEN therapy was assessed on an intent-to-treat basis and was determined by measurement of serum ALT at the end of therapy (24 weeks) and following 24 weeks of observation after the end of treatment (sustained response rate). Serum HCV RNA was also assessed using a research-based quantitative reverse transcriptase <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4120014" conceptname="Polymerase chain reaction">polymerase chain reaction</span> (RT-PCR) assay with a lower limit of sensitivity of 100 copies/mL. Liver histology was assessed by comparing the histology activity index (HAI) score<span class="Sup">6</span> of a pretreatment biopsy specimen with the HAI score from a specimen obtained 24 weeks after cessation of interferon therapy.</p>
<p>Patients enrolled in the study were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups: INFERGEN at a dose of 3 mcg (n = 232), INFERGEN at a dose of 9 mcg (n = 232), or Interferon alfa-2b recombinant (IFN α-2b, Intron<span class="Sup">®</span> A [Intron<span class="Sup">®</span> is a registered trademark of the Schering Corporation]) at a dose of 3 million international units (MIU) (approximately 15 mcg) (n = 240). All patients were scheduled to receive their respective interferons SC TIW for 24 weeks (end of treatment). Following treatment, patients were observed for an additional 24 weeks to assess durability of ALT normalization (end of posttreatment observation). In all patients, a complete response was defined as a decrease in serum ALT to, at, or below the upper limit of normal (48 U/L) at the end of the posttreatment observation period, even if ALT normalization had not been observed at the end of treatment. Complete response was dependent on 2 consecutive normal serum ALT values determined 4 weeks apart. Reduction of HCV RNA to less than 100 copies/mL was measured as a secondary efficacy endpoint (2 consecutive measurements).</p>
<p>Sustained response rates by ALT normalization and HCV RNA reductions to below detectable limits for patients who received initial treatment are included in <span class="Bold"><a href="#A58FBE94-8B07-4D61-AFDD-5D75526A13C6">Table 1</a></span>. Among the INFERGEN treatment groups in this study, the 9 mcg dosage arm demonstrated a similar efficacy profile when compared to the IFN α-2b dosage arm. The 3 mcg INFERGEN dosage arm had lesser efficacy; 3% of patients receiving 3 mcg INFERGEN had sustained reductions in their ALT to within the normal range and 3% had sustained reductions in HCV RNA to below detectable limits.</p>

<p>In this study, liver biopsies were taken at baseline and at the end of posttreatment observation. Similar improvement in liver histology, assessed by HAI score, was observed in the 9 mcg INFERGEN (68%), 3 mcg INFERGEN (63%), and IFN α-2b (65%) dosage arms.</p>

<h2>Subsequent Treatment</h2>
<p class="First">Subsequent treatment with 15 mcg of INFERGEN for 24 and 48 weeks was evaluated in an open-label clinical trial in 208 patients who had failed initial therapy for 24 weeks with either 9 mcg INFERGEN or 3 MIU (approximately 15 mcg) IFN α-2b.<span class="Sup">7</span> Of these patients, 133/208 had failed to normalize ALT during the initial treatment period. Seventy-five of 208 achieved normal ALT during initial treatment, but experienced relapse (return of abnormal ALT) during posttreatment observation. Patients were assessed for normalization of ALT (ALT response rate) and HCV RNA reduction to less than 100 copies/mL (HCV response rate) at the end of 24 weeks of observation following discontinuation of therapy. Sustained response rates measured by ALT normalization and HCV RNA reductions to below detectable limits for patients who received subsequent treatment with 15 mcg of INFERGEN are included in <span class="Bold"><a href="#A270070B-CCDC-48D3-B3F1-44C5176F05A0">Table 2</a></span>.</p>
<p>Patients who received 48 weeks of interferon therapy were more likely to experience a sustained response than were those who received 24 weeks of therapy. Similarly, patients who normalized their serum ALT but subsequently relapsed following initial therapy were more likely to experience a sustained response than those who were refractory to initial therapy.</p>

<p>Serum antibody levels were measured in all patients using both an INFERGEN-binding radioimmunoassay and an IFN α-2b-binding ELISA. A patient was considered to have developed binding antibodies if, using serum samples from 2 consecutive time points, a positive response was detected in either assay. The number of patients developing positive binding antibody responses in either assay was similar in the 9 mcg INFERGEN (11%) and 3 MIU IFN α-2b groups (15%). The titer of neutralizing antibodies to interferon was not measured. Sustained ALT response rates in patients treated with INFERGEN who developed binding antibodies (4/25) were similar to sustained ALT response rates in patients who did not develop detectable antibody titers (40/195). The most frequently observed time to first antibody response was week 16 of interferon treatment. Following cessation of interferon therapy, the number of patients with a positive antibody response declined during posttreatment observation.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First">Treatment with INFERGEN should be administered under the guidance of a qualified physician, and may lead to moderate-to-severe adverse experiences requiring dose reduction, temporary dose cessation, or discontinuation of further therapy.</p>
<p>Withdrawal from study for adverse events occurred in 7% of patients initially treated with 9 mcg INFERGEN (including 4% due to psychiatric events). Withdrawal from study due to adverse events occurred in 5% of patients subsequently treated with 15 mcg INFERGEN for 24 weeks and 11% of patients subsequently treated with 15 mcg INFERGEN for 48 weeks.</p>

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">If home use is determined to be desirable by the physician, instructions on appropriate use should be given by a healthcare professional. The patient must be instructed as to the proper dosage and administration. Information included in the <span class="Bold">MEDICATION GUIDE </span>should be fully reviewed with the patient; it is not a disclosure of all, or possible, adverse effects. The most common adverse reactions occurring with INFERGEN therapy are flu-like symptoms including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4190045" conceptname="Rigor">rigors</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77074" conceptname="Joint pain">arthralgia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442752" conceptname="Muscle pain">myalgia</span>, and increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span>. Non-narcotic analgesics and bedtime administration of INFERGEN may be used to prevent or lessen some of these symptoms.</p>
<p>Additionally, patients must be thoroughly instructed in the importance of proper disposal procedures and cautioned against the reuse of needles, syringes, or re-entry of the drug product. A puncture-resistant container for the disposal of used syringes and needles should be used by the patient and should be disposed of according to the directions provided by the health care provider (see<span class="Bold"><a href="#A55C712E-A674-4ABB-87B4-A68661BB58F5">MEDICATION GUIDE</a></span>).</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of INFERGEN did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. However, treatment with Interferons, including INFERGEN, is associated with psychiatric, cardiac, and systemic (flu-like) adverse effects. Since decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, concomitant disease and the use of other drug therapies in elderly patients may produce adverse reactions of greater severity, caution should be exercised in the use of INFERGEN in this population.</p>

<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span>, usually mild-to-moderate in severity, was reported in 26% of patients who received 9 mcg INFERGEN and was the most common adverse event resulting in study drug discontinuation.</p>
<p>In patients who had tolerated previous interferon therapy (9 mcg INFERGEN or 3 MIU IFN α-2b) and failed to normalize ALT, or who had achieved normalization of ALT during the treatment period but who relapsed during the posttreatment observation period, subsequent treatment with 15 mcg TIW of INFERGEN for 24 or 48 weeks was generally tolerated. Adverse experiences of patients receiving subsequent treatment, regardless of attribution to treatment, are reported in <span class="Bold"><a href="#AD2CA59C-FD13-484F-AFF5-1B6BD69E398C">Table 3</a></span>. The higher dose of INFERGEN used in these patients was associated with a greater incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435224" conceptname="Leukopenia">leukopenia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218497" conceptname="Granulocytopenic disorder">granulocytopenia</span>. One or more dose reductions for all causes were required in up to 36% of patients. Patients who do not tolerate initial standard interferon therapy should not receive therapy with 15 mcg TIW of INFERGEN.</p>

<h2>Laboratory Values</h2>
<p class="First">The following laboratory values were found to be affected by therapy with INFERGEN in the 231 patients who received treatment with 9 mcg INFERGEN.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Hemoglobin and Hematocrit: </span>Treatment with INFERGEN was associated with gradual decreases in mean values for hemoglobin and hematocrit, which were 4% and 5% below baseline at the end of treatment. Decreases from baseline of 20% or more in hemoglobin or hematocrit were seen in 1% of patients or less.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">White Blood Cells: </span>INFERGEN treatment was associated with decreases in mean values for both total white blood cell (WBC) count and ANC within the first 2 weeks of treatment. By the end of treatment, mean decreases from baseline of 19% for WBCs and 23% for ANC were observed. These effects reversed during the posttreatment observation period. In 2 INFERGEN-treated patients in the phase 3 trial, decreases in ANC to levels below 500 x 10<span class="Sup">6</span> cells/L were seen. In both cases, the ANC returned to clinically acceptable levels with reduction of the dose of INFERGEN, and these transient decreases in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4148615" conceptname="Neutrophil count">neutrophils</span> were not associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Platelets: </span>INFERGEN treatment was associated with alterations in platelet count. Decreases in mean platelet count of 16% compared to baseline were seen by the end of treatment. These decreases were reversed during the posttreatment observation period. Values below normal were common during treatment with 3% of patients developing values less than 50 x 10<span class="Sup">9</span> cells/L, usually necessitating dose reduction.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Triglycerides: </span>Mean values for serum triglyceride increased shortly after the start of administration of INFERGEN, with increases of 41%, compared with baseline, at the end of the treatment period. Seven percent of the patients developed values which were at least 3 times above pretreatment levels during treatment. This effect was promptly reversed after discontinuation of treatment.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Thyroid Function: </span>INFERGEN treatment was associated with biochemical changes consistent with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140673" conceptname="Hypothyroidism">hypothyroidism</span> including increases in TSH and decreases in T<span class="Sub">4</span> mean values. Increases in TSH to greater than 7 mU/L were seen in 10% of 9 mcg INFERGEN-treated patients either during the treatment period or the 24-week posttreatment observation period. Thyroid supplements were instituted in approximately one-third of these patients.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Laboratory Values for Subsequent Treatment: </span>From a database of 165 patients receiving subsequent treatment with 15 mcg of INFERGEN for 24 weeks, and 168 patients receiving subsequent treatment with 15 mcg of INFERGEN for 48 weeks after failing initial interferon therapy, similar changes in the laboratory values as outlined above were observed. Mean decreases from baseline up to 23% for WBCs and up to 27% for ANC were observed for patients subsequently treated with interferon, which was greater than during initial treatment. Two patients in the 24-week group experienced reversible reductions in ANC to less than 500 x 10<span class="Sup">6</span> cells/L, which were not associated with infectious complications. No patients discontinued as a result of hematologic toxicity.</p>

<h2>Postmarketing Experience</h2>
<p class="First">In addition, the following potential adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of INFERGEN.

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">In INFERGEN trials, the maximum <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> reported was a dose of 150 mcg INFERGEN administered SC in a patient enrolled in a phase 1 advanced malignancy trial. The patient received 10 times the prescribed dosage for 3 days. The patient experienced a mild increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">anorexia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4190045" conceptname="Rigor">chills</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442752" conceptname="Muscle pain">myalgia</span>. Increases in ALT (15 to 127 IU/L), aspartate transaminase (AST) (15 to 164 IU/L), and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) (183 to 281 IU/L) were reported. These laboratory values returned to normal or to the patient’s baseline values within 30 days.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34068-7">
<a name="section-12"></a><p></p>
<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">The recommended dose of INFERGEN for treatment of chronic HCV <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> is 9 mcg TIW administered SC as a single injection for 24 weeks. At least 48 hours should elapse between doses of INFERGEN. (See<span class="Bold"><a href="#A29D236B-52AD-4D74-B6E7-A8DA1D7C4EC2">illustrated MEDICATION GUIDE</a></span> for instructions.)</p>
<p>Patients who tolerated previous interferon therapy and did not respond or relapsed following its discontinuation may be subsequently treated with 15 mcg of INFERGEN TIW administered SC as a single injection for up to 48 weeks. (See<span class="Bold"><a href="#A29D236B-52AD-4D74-B6E7-A8DA1D7C4EC2">illustrated MEDICATION GUIDE</a></span> for instructions.)</p>
<p>There are significant differences in specific activities among interferons. Healthcare providers should be aware that changes in interferon brand may require adjustments of dosage and/or change in route of administration. Patients should be warned not to change brands of interferon without medical consultation. Patients should also be instructed by their physician not to reduce the dosage of INFERGEN prior to medical consultation.</p>

<a name="AB596096-8C27-47A3-874C-AFE1DC01E189"></a><a name="section-12.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Dose Reduction</h2>
<p class="First">For patients who experience a severe adverse reaction on INFERGEN, dosage should be withheld temporarily. If the adverse reaction does not become tolerable, therapy should be discontinued. Dose reduction to 7.5 mcg may be necessary following an intolerable adverse event. In the pivotal study, 11% of patients (26/231) who initially received INFERGEN at a dose of 9 mcg (0.3 mL) were dose-reduced to 7.5 mcg (0.25 mL).</p>
<p>If adverse reactions continue to occur at the reduced dosage, the physician may discontinue treatment or reduce dosage further. However, decreased efficacy may result from continued treatment at dosages below 7.5 mcg.</p>
<p>During subsequent treatment for 48 weeks with 15 mcg of INFERGEN, up to 36% of patients required dose reductions in 3 mcg increments.</p>

<p>For other possible side effects, please read the section “What are the possible side effects of Infergen?? in this Medication Guide (below).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What is Infergen?</span></p>
<p>Infergen (Interferon alfacon-1) is a medicine used to treat adults with lasting (chronic) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> C virus (HCV) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>. HCV is a liver disease that is caused by the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> C virus and is spread by contact with the blood of a person carrying the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> C virus. Most people who get HCV carry the virus in their blood for the rest of their lives. Most of these people will have some <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver damage</span>, but many do not feel sick from the disease. Some people will develop a badly damaged or scarred liver (cirrhosis). Cirrhosis can cause the liver to stop working.</p>
<p>Your healthcare provider will tell you if the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> C virus you have is resistant (type 1 virus) or easier to treat (type 2 or 3 virus) and the chance of treatments working. Infergen may lower the amount of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194990" conceptname="Inflammatory disease of liver">hepatitis</span> C virus in the body so that it cannot be measured by blood tests. Your healthcare provider should do regular blood tests to check for side effects and your response to treatment.</p>
<p>It is not known if Infergen can cure HCV (permanently get rid of the virus) or if it can prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">liver failure</span> or liver cancer that is caused by HCV <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>.</p>
<p>Infergen therapy alone or in combination with other treatments will not prevent a person with HCV from giving another person the HCV <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Who should not take Infergen?</span></p>

<p><span class="Bold">See the instructions for injecting Infergen (“</span><span class="Bold"><a href="#A29D236B-52AD-4D74-B6E7-A8DA1D7C4EC2">How do I prepare and inject the Infergen dose?</a></span><span class="Bold">?) later in this Medication Guide.</span></p>
<ul class="Disc">
<li><p class="First">Infergen is given as an injection under your skin. Your healthcare provider will inject your Infergen when you first start using it. Your healthcare provider will decide if you, a family member, or a friend is able to inject your Infergen at home. Your healthcare provider will teach you or the person that will be giving your injections, the right way to prepare and inject Infergen. Make sure you understand the instructions before you inject Infergen at home.</p></li>
<li><p class="First">Infergen comes in ready-to-use vials. There is one dose of medicine in each vial. Your healthcare provider will tell you the amount (your dose) to inject. Do not change your dose unless your healthcare provider tells you to change it. It is important that you take Infergen exactly as your healthcare provider tells you. Too little Infergen may not be effective in treating your HCV <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> and too much Infergen may cause side effects.</p></li>
<li><p class="First">Inject your dose of Infergen three times a week, at the same time of day.</p></li>
<li><p class="First">If you miss a dose of Infergen, give yourself an injection as soon as you remember and then call your healthcare provider. Do not take your next scheduled dose until you have been told what you should do by your healthcare provider.</p></li>
<li><p class="First">If you take more than your prescribed amount of Infergen, call your healthcare provider right away. Your healthcare provider may want to examine you.</p></li>
<li><p class="First">Once you start treatment with Infergen, do not switch to another brand of interferon without talking to your healthcare provider. Other interferons may not have the same effect on the treatment of your disease. Switching brands will also require a change in your dose.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You must get regular blood tests to help your healthcare provider check to see how the treatment is working and to check for side effects.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What should I avoid while taking Infergen?</span></p>
<ul class="Disc">
<li><p class="First">Avoid becoming pregnant while taking Infergen. Infergen may cause harm to an unborn child or cause you to lose your baby (miscarry).</p></li>
<li><p class="First">Do not breastfeed your baby while taking Infergen.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>HOW DO I PREPARE AND INJECT THE INFERGEN DOSE?</h2>
<p class="First">Find a clean, comfortable, well-lit place and remove a vial of Infergen from the refrigerator and allow it to reach room temperature.</p>
<p>1. Assemble the supplies you will need for your injection:</p>
<ul class="Disc">
<li><p class="First">A vial of Infergen</p></li>
<li><p class="First">One sterile disposable syringe and needle</p></li>
<li><p class="First">Several alcohol swabs and</p></li>
<li><p class="First">A puncture-proof container to dispose of the needle and syringe when you are done</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="Figure">
<img alt="Image from Drug Label Content" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=A7248ECA-45D6-472D-8C2A-D8887C2594D5&amp;name=interferon-figure-01.jpg"><p class="MultiMediaCaption"></p>
</div>
<p>2. Make sure you have the right syringe to use with Infergen. It is important to use a syringe that is marked in tenths of millimeters (mLs), for example, 0.1 mL. Your healthcare provider may refer to a mL as a cc (1 mL = 1 cc). Failure to use the right syringe can lead to a mistake in dosage. You may receive too little or too much Infergen.</p>
<p>3. Check the date on the vial of Infergen and make sure that the date has not passed and look at the liquid inside the vial.</p>
<ul class="Disc"><li>
<p class="First">Do not use the Infergen if:</p>
<ul class="Circle">
<li><p class="First">The liquid is cloudy</p></li>
<li><p class="First">The liquid is not clear and colorless</p></li>
<li><p class="First">The liquid has particles</p></li>
<li><p class="First">The expiration date has passed</p></li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
<p>4. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.</p>
<div class="Figure">
<img alt="Image from Drug Label Content" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=A7248ECA-45D6-472D-8C2A-D8887C2594D5&amp;name=interferon-figure-02.jpg"><p class="MultiMediaCaption"></p>
</div>
<p><span class="Bold">SELECT AND PREPARE THE INJECTION SITE ON YOUR BODY</span></p>
<p>5. Pick a site for your injection.</p>
<ul class="Disc">
<li><p class="First">Back of the upper arms (if someone is giving you the injection)</p></li>
<li><p class="First">Upper stomach area (abdomen), except for the belly button (navel) and waist areas</p></li>
<li><p class="First">Upper thighs</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="Figure">

</div>
<p>You should change the site for injection each time you inject to avoid soreness at any one site.</p>
<p>6. Clean the injection site with an alcohol swab. Use circular motions from the inside to the outside. Keep the used alcohol swab nearby.</p>
<div class="Figure">
<img alt="Image from Drug Label Content" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=A7248ECA-45D6-472D-8C2A-D8887C2594D5&amp;name=interferon-figure-04.jpg"><p class="MultiMediaCaption"></p>

<p><span class="Bold">PREPARING THE DOSE</span></p>
<p>7. Remove the colored cap from the vial, exposing the rubber stopper.</p>

</div>
<p>8. Clean the rubber stopper with a new alcohol swab, and then cover the stopper with the swab.</p>
<div class="Figure">
<img alt="Image from Drug Label Content" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=A7248ECA-45D6-472D-8C2A-D8887C2594D5&amp;name=interferon-figure-06.jpg"><p class="MultiMediaCaption"></p>
</div>
<p>9. Remove the syringe and needle from their packages. If either package looks like there have been opened or damaged, do not use the syringe or needle; dispose of it in the puncture-proof disposal container.</p>
<p>10. Remove the needle cover and pull the plunger back and draw air into the syringe. The amount of air you draw into the syringe should be the same amount as the dose of medicine your healthcare provider has prescribed.</p>
<div class="Figure">
<img alt="Image from Drug Label Content" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=A7248ECA-45D6-472D-8C2A-D8887C2594D5&amp;name=interferon-figure-07.jpg"><p class="MultiMediaCaption"></p>
</div>
<p>11. Remove the alcohol wipe from the top of the vial and insert the needle straight through the center of the rubber stopper.</p>
<p>12. Push the plunger of the syringe down to inject the air into the air space above the liquid in the vial. The air injected into the vial will allow Infergen to be easily withdrawn from the vial into the syringe.</p>
<div class="Figure">
<img alt="Image from Drug Label Content" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=A7248ECA-45D6-472D-8C2A-D8887C2594D5&amp;name=interferon-figure-08.jpg"><p class="MultiMediaCaption"></p>
</div>
<p>13. Keeping the needle in the vial, turn the vial upside down and make sure that the tip of the needle is in the liquid.</p>
<div class="Figure">
<img alt="Image from Drug Label Content" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=A7248ECA-45D6-472D-8C2A-D8887C2594D5&amp;name=interferon-figure-09.jpg"><p class="MultiMediaCaption"></p>
</div>
<p>14. Slowly pull the plunger back and let the medicine enter the syringe, filling it to the line that equals the dose your healthcare provider prescribed.</p>
<p>15. Keeping the needle in the vial, check for air bubbles in the syringe. Air bubbles are harmless but can reduce the dose you should be receiving. To remove the air bubbles, gently tap the syringe with your fingers until the bubbles rise to the needle-end of the syringe barrel. Then push the plunger in to force the air out of the syringe.</p>
<p>Make sure the tip of the needle is in the liquid and slowly pull back on the plunger until the liquid in the syringe reaches the mark that correctly matches the amount of your dose.</p>
<p>16. Take the needle out of the vial and hold the syringe needle facing up in the hand that you will use to inject yourself. Do not lay the syringe down or allow the needle to touch anything.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">INJECTING THE DOSE</span></p>
<p>17. Use the other hand to pinch a fold of skin at the site you cleaned for an injection.</p>

<img alt="Image from Drug Label Content" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=A7248ECA-45D6-472D-8C2A-D8887C2594D5&amp;name=interferon-figure-10.jpg"><p class="MultiMediaCaption"></p>
</div>
<p>18. Hold the syringe the way you would hold a pencil and insert the needle either straight up and down (90 degree angle) or at a slight angle (45 degree angle) to the skin.</p>
<div class="Figure">
<img alt="Image from Drug Label Content" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=A7248ECA-45D6-472D-8C2A-D8887C2594D5&amp;name=interferon-figure-11.jpg"><p class="MultiMediaCaption"></p>
</div>
<p>19. After the needle is in, let go of the skin. Pull the plunger back slightly.<span class="Bold"> If blood appears, do not inject Infergen, because the needle has entered a blood vessel. </span>Withdraw the syringe and discard it. Prepare a new syringe and inject at a new site. Repeat this procedure at the second site, checking for blood before injecting.</p>
<p>20. If no blood appears, slowly push down on the plunger all the way, until all the medicine is gone from the syringe.</p>
<div class="Figure">
<img alt="Image from Drug Label Content" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=A7248ECA-45D6-472D-8C2A-D8887C2594D5&amp;name=interferon-figure-12.jpg"><p class="MultiMediaCaption"></p>
</div>
<p>21. Pull the needle out of the skin at the same angle you put it in and place an alcohol swab over the injection site, then press for several seconds.</p>
<div class="Figure">
<img alt="Image from Drug Label Content" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=A7248ECA-45D6-472D-8C2A-D8887C2594D5&amp;name=interferon-figure-13.jpg"><p class="MultiMediaCaption"></p>
</div>
<p>22. Promptly place the needle and syringe in the puncture-proof disposal container. <span class="Bold">Never reuse the syringe or needle. Do not recap the needle.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Disposal</span></p>
<p>Dispose of syringes and needles as directed by your healthcare provider or pharmacist. There may be special state and local laws.</p>
<p>Place all used needles, needle covers, and syringes in a special container called a “Sharps Container? or a hard plastic container‚ or a metal container with a plastic lid. Do not use glass or clear plastic containers‚ or any container that will allow the needles to stick through them.</p>
<p>Always keep the container out of the reach of children.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Do not recycle containers or throw full containers into the household trash.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">How should I store Infergen?</span></p>
<ul class="Disc">
<li><p class="First">Store Infergen in the refrigerator at 36° to 46°F (2° to 8°C)‚ but not in the freezer compartment.</p></li>
<li><p class="First">Do not let Infergen freeze or leave it in direct sunlight.</p></li>
<li><p class="First">Do not use a vial of Infergen that has been frozen or past the expiration date stamped on the label. If you think that the Infergen has been frozen or left in direct sunlight‚ do not use it‚ and call your healthcare provider or nurse for instructions.</p></li>
<li><p class="First">To transport Infergen‚ keep the vials cool and avoid extreme temperature changes.</p></li>
<li><p class="First">Do not shake Infergen. If Infergen is shaken too hard, it will not work properly.</p></li>
<li><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Keep Infergen and all medicines out of the reach of children.</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Bold">General advice about prescription medicines</span></p>
<p>Medicines are sometimes prescribed for purposes other than those listed in a Medication Guide. If you have any concerns about Infergen, ask your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider or pharmacist can give you information about Infergen that was written for healthcare professionals. Do not use Infergen for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not share this medicine with other people.</p>
