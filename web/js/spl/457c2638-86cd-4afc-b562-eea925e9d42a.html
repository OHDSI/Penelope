<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<br><p class="First">Repaglinide is an oral blood glucose-lowering drug of the meglitinide class used in the management of type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus (also known as non-insulin dependent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201826" conceptname="Type 2 diabetes mellitus">NIDDM</span>). Repaglinide, S(+)2-ethoxy-4(2((3-methyl-1-(2-(1-piperidinyl) phenyl)-butyl) amino)-2-oxoethyl) benzoic acid, is chemically unrelated to the oral sulfonylurea insulin secretagogues.<br><br>The structural formula is as shown below:</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></p>
<p>Repaglinide lowers blood glucose levels by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas. This action is dependent upon functioning beta (β) cells in the pancreatic islets. Insulin release is glucose-dependent and diminishes at low glucose concentrations.</p>
<p>Repaglinide closes ATP-dependent potassium channels in the b-cell membrane by binding at characterizable sites. This potassium channel blockade depolarizes the β-cell, which leads to an opening of calcium channels. The resulting increased calcium influx induces insulin secretion. The ion channel mechanism is highly tissue selective with low affinity for heart and skeletal muscle.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Absorption: </span>After oral administration, repaglinide is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. After single and multiple oral doses in healthy subjects or in patients, peak plasma drug levels (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) occur within 1 hour (T<span class="Sub">max</span>). Repaglinide is rapidly eliminated from the blood stream with a half-life of approximately 1 hour. The mean absolute bioavailability is 56%. When repaglinide was given with food, the mean T<span class="Sub">max</span> was not changed, but the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC (area under the time/plasma concentration curve) were decreased 20% and 12.4%, respectively.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Distribution: </span>After intravenous (IV) dosing in healthy subjects, the volume of distribution at steady state (V<span class="Sub">ss</span>) was 31 L, and the total body clearance (CL) was 38 L/h. Protein binding and binding to human serum albumin was greater than 98%.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Metabolism: </span>Repaglinide is completely metabolized by oxidative biotransformation and</p>
<p>direct conjugation with glucuronic acid after either an IV or oral dose. The major metabolites are an oxidized dicarboxylic acid (M2), the aromatic amine (M1), and the acyl glucuronide (M7). The cytochrome P-450 enzyme system, specifically 2C8 and 3A4, have been shown to be involved in the N-dealkylation of repaglinide to M2 and the further oxidation to M1. Metabolites do not contribute to the glucose-lowering effect of repaglinide.</p>
<p>Repaglinide appears to be a substrate for active hepatic uptake transporter (organic anion transporting protein OATP1B1).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Excretion: </span>Within 96 hours after dosing with <span class="Sup">14</span>C-repaglinide as a single, oral dose, approximately 90% of the radiolabel was recovered in the feces and approximately 8% in the urine. Only 0.1% of the dose is cleared in the urine as parent compound. The major metabolite (M2) accounted for 60% of the administered dose. Less than 2% of parent drug was recovered in feces.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetic Parameters</span>: The pharmacokinetic parameters of repaglinide obtained</p>
<p>from a single-dose, crossover study in healthy subjects and from a multiple-dose, parallel, dose-proportionality (0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mg) study in patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> are summarized in the following table:</p>

<p>These data indicate that repaglinide did not accumulate in serum. Clearance of oral repaglinide did not change over the 0.5 - 4 mg dose range, indicating a linear relationship between dose and plasma drug levels.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Variability of Exposure: </span>Repaglinide AUC after multiple doses of 0.25 to 4 mg with each meal varies over a wide range. The intra-individual and inter-individual coefficients of variation were 36% and 69%, respectively. AUC over the therapeutic dose range included 69 to 1005 ng/mL*hr, but AUC exposure up to 5417 ng/mL*hr was reached in dose escalation studies without apparent adverse consequences.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Special Populations:</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Geriatric: </span>Healthy volunteers were treated with a regimen of 2 mg taken before each of 3 meals. There were no significant differences in repaglinide pharmacokinetics between the group of patients &lt;65 years of age and a comparably sized group of patients ≥65 years of age. (See <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use</span>)</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pediatric: </span>No studies have been performed in pediatric patients.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Gender: </span>A comparison of pharmacokinetics in males and females showed the AUC over the 0.5 mg to 4 mg dose range to be 15% to 70% higher in females with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>. This difference was not reflected in the frequency of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemic episodes</span> (male: 16%; female: 17%) or other adverse events. With respect to gender, no change in general dosage recommendation is indicated since dosage for each patient should be individualized to achieve optimal clinical response.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Race: </span>No pharmacokinetic studies to assess the effects of race have been performed, but in a U.S. 1-year study in patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, the blood glucose-lowering effect was comparable between Caucasians (n=297) and African-Americans (n=33). In a U.S. dose-response study, there was no apparent difference in exposure (AUC) between Caucasians (n=74) and Hispanics (n=33).</p>
<br><p><span class="Bold">Drug-Drug Interactions:</span></p>
<p>Drug interaction studies performed in healthy volunteers show that Repaglinide had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of digoxin, theophylline, or warfarin. Co-administration of cimetidine with Repaglinide did not significantly alter the absorption and disposition of repaglinide. </p>
<p>Additionally, the following drugs were studied in healthy volunteers with co-administration of Repaglinide. Listed below are the results:</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors/Inducer</span></span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Gemfibrozil and Itraconazole: </span>Co-administration of gemfibrozil (600 mg) and a single dose of 0.25 mg Repaglinide (after 3 days of twice-daily 600 mg gemfibrozil) resulted in an 8.1- fold higher repaglinide AUC and prolonged repaglinide half-life from 1.3 to 3.7 hr. Co-administration with itraconazole and a single dose of 0.25 mg Repaglinide (on the third day of a regimen of 200 mg initial dose, twice-daily 100 mg itraconazole) resulted in a 1.4- fold higher repaglinide AUC. Co-administration of both gemfibrozil and itraconazole with Repaglinide resulted in a 19-fold higher repaglinide AUC and prolonged repaglinide half-life to 6.1 hr. Plasma repaglinide concentration at 7 h increased 28.6-fold with gemfibrozil co-administration and 70.4-fold with the gemfibrozil-itraconazole combination (see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS,</span><span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, Drug-Drug Interactions</span>).</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Fenofibrate: </span>Co-administration of 200 mg fenofibrate with a single dose of 0.25 mg repaglinide (after 5 days of once daily fenofibrate 200 mg) resulted in unchanged AUC and C<span class="Sub">max </span>values for both drugs.<br><br><span class="Italics">Ketoconazole: </span>Co-administration of 200 mg ketoconazole and a single dose of 2 mg</p>
<p>Repaglinide (after 4 days of once daily ketoconazole 200 mg) resulted in a 15% and 16% increase in repaglinide AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span>, respectively.

<p>In another study, co-administration of 600 mg rifampin and a single dose of 4 mg Repaglinide (after 6 days of once daily rifampin 600 mg) resulted in a 48% and 17% decrease in repaglinide median AUC and median C<span class="Sub">max</span> respectively. The median decreases were from 54 ng/mL*hr to 28 ng/mL*hr for AUC and from 35 ng/mL to 29 ng/mL for C<span class="Sub">max</span>. Repaglinide administered by itself (after 7 days of once daily rifampin 600 mg) resulted in an 80% and 79% decrease in repaglinide median AUC and C<span class="Sub">max </span>respectively. The decreases were from 54 ng/mL*hr to 11 ng/mL*hr for AUC and from 35 ng/mL to 7.5 ng/mL for C<span class="Sub">max</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Levonorgestrel &amp; Ethinyl Estradiol:</span></span><span class="Italics"></span>Co-administration of a combination tablet of 0.15 mg levonorgestrel and 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol administered once daily for 21 days with     2 mg Repaglinide administered three times daily (days 1-4) and a single dose on Day 5 resulted in 20% increases in repaglinide, levonorgestrel, and ethinyl estradiol C<span class="Sub">max</span>. The increase in repaglinide C<span class="Sub">max</span> was from 40.5 ng/mL to 47.4 ng/mL.

<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span>: </span></p>
<p>Single-dose and steady-state pharmacokinetics of repaglinide were compared between patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> and normal renal function (CrCl &gt; 80 mL/min), mild to moderate renal function impairment (CrCl = 40 - 80 mL/min), and severe renal function impairment (CrCl = 20 – 40 mL/min). Both AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of repaglinide were similar in patients with normal and mild to moderately <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> (mean values 56.7 ng/mL*hr vs 57.2 ng/mL*hr and 37.5 ng/mL vs 37.7 ng/mL, respectively.) Patients with severely reduced renal function had elevated mean AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> values (98.0 ng/mL*hr and 50.7 ng/mL, respectively), but this study showed only a weak correlation between repaglinide levels and creatinine clearance. Initial dose adjustment does not appear to be necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction. <span class="Bold">However, patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> who have severe renal function impairment should initiate Repaglinide therapy with the 0.5 mg dose - subsequently, patients should be carefully titrated.

<p><span class="Bold">Clinical Trials</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Monotherapy Trials</span></p>
<p>A four-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose response trial was conducted in 138 patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> using doses ranging from 0.25 to 4 mg taken with each of three meals. Repaglinide therapy resulted in dose-proportional glucose-lowering over the full dose range. Plasma insulin levels increased after meals and reverted toward baseline before the next meal. Most of the fasting blood glucose-lowering effect was demonstrated within 1-2 weeks. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-month dose titration study, Repaglinide or placebo doses for each patient were increased weekly from 0.25 mg through 0.5, 1, and 2 mg, to a maximum of 4 mg, until a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level &lt;160 mg/dL was achieved or the maximum dose reached. The dose that achieved the targeted control or the maximum dose was continued to end of study. FPG and 2-hour postprandial glucose (PPG) increased in patients receiving placebo and decreased in patients treated with repaglinide. Differences between the repaglinide- and placebo-treated groups were –61 mg/dL (FPG) and -104 mg/dL (PPG). The between-group change in HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span>, which reflects long-term glycemic control, was 1.7% units.</p>

HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> for the Repaglinide-treated groups (1 and 4 mg groups combined) at the end of the study was decreased compared to the placebo-treated group in previously naïve patients and in patients previously treated with oral hypoglycemic agents by 2.1% units and 1.7% units, respectively. In this fixed-dose trial, patients who were naïve to oral hypoglycemic agent therapy and patients in relatively good glycemic control at baseline (HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> below 8%) showed greater blood glucose-lowering including a higher frequency of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. Patients who were previously treated and who had baseline HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> ≥8% reported <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> at the same rate as patients randomized to placebo. There was no average gain in body weight when patients previously treated with oral hypoglycemic agents were switched to Repaglinide. The average <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span> in patients treated with Repaglinide and not previously treated with sulfonylurea drugs was 3.3%.</p>
<br><p>The dosing of Repaglinide relative to meal-related insulin release was studied in three trials including 58 patients. Glycemic control was maintained during a period in which the meal and dosing pattern was varied (2, 3 or 4 meals per day; before meals x 2, 3, or 4) compared with a period of 3 regular meals and 3 doses per day (before meals x 3). It was also shown that Repaglinide can be administered at the start of a meal, 15 minutes before, or 30 minutes before the meal with the same blood glucose-lowering effect.</p>
<br><p>Repaglinide was compared to other insulin secretagogues in 1-year controlled trials to demonstrate comparability of efficacy and safety. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">Hypoglycemia</span> was reported in 16% of</p>
<p>1228 Repaglinide patients, 20% of 417 glyburide patients, and 19% of 81 glipizide patients. Of Repaglinide treated patients with symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>, none developed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span> or required hospitalization.</p>
<br><p><span class="Bold">Combination Trials</span></p>
<p>A combination therapy regimen of Repaglinide and pioglitazone was compared to monotherapy with either agent alone in a 24-week trial that enrolled 246 patients previously treated with sulfonylurea or metformin monotherapy (HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> &gt;7.0%). Numbers of patients treated were: Repaglinide (N = 61), pioglitazone (N = 62), combination (N = 123). Repaglinide dosage was titrated during the first 12 weeks, followed by a 12-week maintenance period. Combination therapy resulted in significantly greater improvement in glycemic control as compared to monotherapy (figure below). The changes from baseline for completers in FPG (mg/dL) and HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> (%), respectively were: -39.8 and -0.1 for Repaglinide, -35.3 and -0.1 for pioglitazone and -92.4 and -1.9 for the combination. In this study where pioglitazone dosage was kept constant, the combination therapy group showed dose-sparing effects with respect to Repaglinide (see figure legend). The greater efficacy response of the combination group was achieved at a lower daily repaglinide dosage than in the Repaglinide monotherapy group. Mean <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight increases</span> associated with combination, Repaglinide and pioglitazone therapy were 5.5 kg, 0.3 kg, and 2.0 kg respectively.</p>

<p>Subjects with FPG above 270 mg/dL were withdrawn from the study.</p>
<p>Pioglitazone dose: fixed at 30 mg/day; Repaglinide median final dose: 6 mg/day for combination and 10 mg/day for monotherapy.</p>
<p>A combination therapy regimen of Repaglinide and rosiglitazone was compared to monotherapy with either agent alone in a 24-week trial that enrolled 252 patients previously treated with sulfonylurea or metformin (HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> &gt;7.0%). Combination therapy resulted in significantly greater improvement in glycemic control as compared to monotherapy (table below). The glycemic effects of the combination therapy were dose-sparing with respect to both total daily Repaglinide dosage and total daily rosiglitazone dosage (see table legend). A greater efficacy response of the combination therapy group was achieved with half the median daily dose of Repaglinide and rosiglitazone, as compared to the respective monotherapy groups. Mean weight change associated with combination therapy was greater than that of Repaglinide monotherapy.</p>

<h2>GENERAL PRECAUTIONS</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">General: </span>Repaglinide is not indicated for use in combination with NPH-insulin (See <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS, Cardiovascular Events</span>).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Macrovascular Outcomes: </span></p>
<p>There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with Repaglinide or any other anti-diabetic drug.<br></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">Hypoglycemia</span>: </span>All oral blood glucose-lowering drugs including repaglinide are capable of producing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. Proper patient selection, dosage, and instructions to the patients are important to avoid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemic episodes</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">Hepatic insufficiency</span> may cause elevated repaglinide blood levels and may diminish gluconeogenic capacity, both of which increase the risk of serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal, pituitary, hepatic, or severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> may be particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic action of glucose-lowering drugs.<br><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">Hypoglycemia</span> may be difficult to recognize in the elderly and in people taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">Hypoglycemia</span> is more likely to occur when caloric intake is deficient, after severe or prolonged exercise, when alcohol is ingested, or when more than one glucose-lowering drug is used.<br>The frequency of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> is greater in patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> who have not been previously treated with oral blood glucose-lowering drugs (naïve) or whose HbA<span class="Sub">1c </span>is less than 8%.

<br><p><span class="Bold">Loss of control of Blood Glucose: </span>When a patient stabilized on any diabetic regimen is</p>

At such times, it may be necessary to discontinue Repaglinide and administer insulin. The effectiveness of any hypoglycemic drug in lowering blood glucose to a desired level decreases in many patients over a period of time, which may be due to progression of the severity of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> or to diminished responsiveness to the drug. This phenomenon is known as secondary failure, to distinguish it from primary failure in which the drug is ineffective in an individual patient when the drug is first given. Adequate adjustment of dose and adherence to diet should be assessed before classifying a patient as a secondary failure.<span class="Bold"></span></p>

<h2>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</h2>
<p class="First">Patients should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of Repaglinide and of alternative modes of therapy. They should also be informed about the importance of adherence to dietary instructions, of a regular exercise program, and of regular testing of blood glucose and HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span>. The risks of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>, its symptoms and treatment, and conditions that predispose to its development and concomitant administration of other glucose-lowering drugs should be explained to patients and responsible family members. Primary and secondary failure should also be explained.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Patients should be instructed to take Repaglinide before meals (2, 3, or 4 times a day preprandially). </span>Doses are usually taken within 15 minutes of the meal but time may vary from immediately preceding the meal to as long as 30 minutes before the meal. <span class="Bold">Patients who skip a meal (or add an extra meal) should be instructed to skip (or add) a dose for that meal.</span></p>

<a name="Section_6.3"></a><a name="section-5.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>LABORATORY TESTS</h2>
<p class="First">Response to all diabetic therapies should be monitored by periodic measurements of fasting blood glucose and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4123836" conceptname="Glycosylated hemoglobin">glycosylated hemoglobin</span> levels with a goal of decreasing these levels towards the normal range. During dose adjustment, fasting glucose can be used to determine the therapeutic response. Thereafter, both glucose and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4123836" conceptname="Glycosylated hemoglobin">glycosylated hemoglobin</span> should be monitored. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4123836" conceptname="Glycosylated hemoglobin">Glycosylated hemoglobin</span> may be especially useful for evaluating long-term glycemic control. Postprandial glucose level testing may be clinically helpful in patients whose pre-meal blood glucose levels are satisfactory but whose overall glycemic control (HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span>) is inadequate.</p>

<a name="Section_6.4"></a><a name="section-5.4"></a><p></p>
<h2>DRUG INTERACTIONS</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro </span>data indicate that Repaglinide is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes 2C8 and 3A4. Consequently, repaglinide metabolism may be altered by drugs which influence these cytochrome P450 enzyme systems via induction and inhibition. Caution should therefore be used in patients who are on Repaglinide and taking inhibitors and/or inducers of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. The effect may be very significant if both enzymes are inhibited at the same time resulting in a substantial increase in repaglinide plasma concentrations. Drugs that are known to inhibit CYP3A4 include antifungal agents like ketoconazole, itraconazole, and antibacterial agents like erythromycin. Drugs that are known to inhibit CYP2C8 include agents like trimethoprim, gemfibrozil and montelukast. Drugs that induce the CYP3A4 and/or 2C8 enzyme systems include rifampin, barbiturates, and carbamezapine. See <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY </span>section, <span class="Bold">Drug-Drug Interactions</span>.</p>
<p>Repaglinide appears to be a substrate for active hepatic uptake transporter (organic anion transporting protein OATP1B1). Drugs that inhibit OATP1B1 (e.g., cyclosporine) may likewise have the potential to increase plasma concentrations of repaglinide. See <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY </span>section, <span class="Bold">Drug-Drug Interactions</span>. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vivo </span>data from a study that evaluated the co-administration of a cytochrome P450 enzyme 3A4 inhibitor, clarithromycin, with Repaglinide resulted in a clinically significant increase in repaglinide plasma levels. In addition, an increase in repaglinide plasma levels was observed in a study that evaluated the co-administration of Repaglinide with trimethoprim and Repaglinide with deferasirox, both cytochrome P-450 enzyme 2C8 inhibitors. These increases in repaglinide plasma levels may necessitate a Repaglinide dose adjustment. See <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY </span>section, <span class="Bold">Drug-Drug Interactions</span>.</p>
<br><p>Gemfibrozil significantly increased Repaglinide exposure. Therefore, patients should not take Repaglinide with gemfibrozil. See <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY </span>section, Drug-Drug Interactions, and <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS. </span></p>
<p>The hypoglycemic action of oral blood glucose-lowering agents may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, cyclosporine, chloramphenicol, coumarins, probenecid, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta adrenergic blocking agents. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving oral blood glucose-lowering agents, the patient should be observed closely for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving oral blood glucose-lowering agents, the patient should be observed closely for loss of glycemic control.</p>
<p>Certain drugs tend to produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span> and may lead to loss of glycemic control. These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, and isoniazid. When these drugs are administered to a patient receiving oral blood glucose-lowering agents, the patient should be observed for loss of glycemic control. When these drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving oral blood glucose-lowering agents, the patient should be observed closely for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>.</p>

<h2>CARCINOGENESIS &amp; MUTAGENESIS &amp; IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY</h2>
<p class="First">Long-term carcinogenicity studies were performed for 104 weeks at doses up to and including 120 mg/kg body weight/day (rats) and 500 mg/kg body weight/day (mice) or approximately 60 and 125 times clinical exposure, respectively, on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. No evidence of carcinogenicity was found in mice or female rats. In male rats, there was an increased incidence of benign <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> of the thyroid and liver. The relevance of these findings to humans is unclear. The no-effect doses for these observations in male rats were 30 mg/kg body weight/day for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030041" conceptname="Thyroid nodule">thyroid tumors</span> and 60 mg/kg body weight/day for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322895" conceptname="Nodule of liver">liver tumors</span>, which are over 15 and 30 times, respectively, clinical exposure on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p>
<p>Repaglinide was non-genotoxic in a battery of <span class="Italics">in vivo </span>and <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>studies: Bacterial mutagenesis (Ames test), <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>forward cell mutation assay in V79 cells (HGPRT), <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>chromosomal aberration assay in human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span>, unscheduled and replicating DNA synthesis in rat liver, and <span class="Italics">in vivo </span>mouse and rat micronucleus tests.</p>
<p>Fertility of male and female rats was unaffected by repaglinide administration at doses up to 80 mg/kg body weight/day (females) and 300 mg/kg body weight/day (males); over 40 times clinical exposure on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p>

<h2>PREGNANCY</h2>
<p class="First">Pregnancy category C</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Teratogenic Effects: </span>Safety in pregnant women has not been established. Repaglinide was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits at doses 40 times (rats) and approximately 0.8 times (rabbit) clinical exposure (on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) throughout pregnancy. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Repaglinide should be used during pregnancy only if it is clearly needed.</p>
<p>Because recent information suggests that abnormal blood glucose levels during pregnancy are associated with a higher incidence of congenital abnormalities, many experts recommend that insulin be used during pregnancy to maintain blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Nonteratogenic Effects: </span>Offspring of rat dams exposed to repaglinide at 15 times clinical exposure on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis during days 17 to 22 of gestation and during lactation developed nonteratogenic skeletal deformities consisting of shortening, thickening, and bending of the humerus during the postnatal period. This effect was not seen at doses up to 2.5 times clinical exposure (on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) on days 1 to 22 of pregnancy or at higher doses given during days 1 to 16 of pregnancy. Relevant human exposure has not occurred to date and therefore the safety of Repaglinide administration throughout pregnancy or lactation cannot be established.</p>

<h2>NURSING MOTHERS</h2>
<p class="First">In rat reproduction studies, measurable levels of repaglinide were detected in the breast milk of the dams and lowered blood glucose levels were observed in the pups. Cross fostering studies indicated that skeletal changes (see <span class="Bold">Nonteratogenic Effects</span>) could be induced in control pups nursed by treated dams, although this occurred to a lesser degree than those pups treated <span class="Italics">in utero</span>. Although it is not known whether repaglinide is excreted in human milk some oral agents are known to be excreted by this route. Because the potential for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> in nursing infants may exist, and because of the effects on nursing animals, a decision should be made as to whether Repaglinide should be discontinued in nursing mothers, or if mothers should discontinue nursing. If Repaglinide is discontinued and if diet alone is inadequate for controlling blood glucose, insulin therapy should be considered.</p>

<h2>GERIATRIC USE</h2>
<p class="First">In repaglinide clinical studies of 24 weeks or greater duration, 415 patients were over 65 years of age. In one-year, active-controlled trials, no differences were seen in effectiveness or adverse events between these subjects and those less than 65 other than the expected age-related increase in cardiovascular events observed for Repaglinide and comparator drugs. There was no increase in frequency or severity of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> in older subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals to Repaglinide therapy cannot be ruled out.</p>

<p>Repaglinide has been administered to 2931 individuals during clinical trials. Approximately 1500 of these individuals with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> have been treated for at least 3 months, 1000 for at least 6 months, and 800 for at least 1 year. The majority of these individuals (1228) received Repaglinide in one of five 1-year, active-controlled trials. The comparator drugs in these 1-year trials were oral sulfonylurea drugs (SU) including glyburide and glipizide. Over one year, 13% of Repaglinide patients were discontinued due to adverse events, as were 14% of SU patients. The most common adverse events leading to withdrawal were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>, and related symptoms (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>). Mild or moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> occurred in 16% of Repaglinide patients, 20% of glyburide patients, and 19% of glipizide patients. </p>
<p>The table below lists common adverse events for Repaglinide patients compared to both placebo (in trials 12 to 24 weeks duration) and to glyburide and glipizide in one year trials. The adverse event profile of Repaglinide was generally comparable to that for sulfonylurea drugs (SU).<br><br><br><br><img alt="repaglinide-3" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=457c2638-86cd-4afc-b562-eea925e9d42a&amp;name=repaglinide-3.jpg"></p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">In a clinical trial, patients received increasing doses of Repaglinide up to 80 mg a day for 14 days. There were few adverse effects other than those associated with the intended effect of lowering blood glucose. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">Hypoglycemia</span> did not occur when meals were given with these high doses. Hypoglycemic symptoms without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372448" conceptname="Loss of consciousness">loss of consciousness</span> or neurologic findings should be treated aggressively with oral glucose and adjustments in drug dosage and/or meal patterns. Close monitoring may continue until the physician is assured that the patient is out of danger. Patients should be closely monitored for a minimum of 24 to 48 hours, since <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> may recur after apparent clinical recovery. There is no evidence that repaglinide is dialyzable using hemodialysis.</p>
<p>Severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemic reactions</span> with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span>, or other neurological impairment occur infrequently, but constitute medical emergencies requiring immediate hospitalization. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380688" conceptname="Hypoglycemic coma">hypoglycemic coma</span> is diagnosed or suspected, the patient should be given a rapid intravenous injection of concentrated (50%) glucose solution. This should be followed by a continuous infusion of more dilute (10%) glucose solution at a rate that will maintain the blood glucose at a level above 100 mg/dL.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34068-7">
<a name="Section_10"></a><a name="section-8"></a><p></p>
<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> with Repaglinide. </p>
<p>The patient’s blood glucose should be monitored periodically to determine the minimum effective dose for the patient; to detect primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication; and to detect secondary failure, i.e., loss of an adequate blood glucose-lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4123836" conceptname="Glycosylated hemoglobin">Glycosylated hemoglobin</span> levels are of value in monitoring the patient’s longer term response to therapy.</p>
<p>Short-term administration of Repaglinide may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually well controlled on diet.</p>
<p>Repaglinide doses are usually taken within 15 minutes of the meal but time may vary from immediately preceding the meal to as long as 30 minutes before the meal.</p>
<br><p><span class="Bold">Starting Dose </span></p>
<p>For patients not previously treated or whose HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> is &lt; 8%, the starting dose should be 0.5 mg with each meal. For patients previously treated with blood glucose-lowering drugs and whose HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> is ≥8%, the initial dose is 1 or 2 mg with each meal preprandially (see previous paragraph).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Dose Adjustment</span></p>
<p>Dosing adjustments should be determined by blood glucose response, usually fasting blood glucose. Postprandial glucose levels testing may be clinically helpful in patients whose pre-meal blood glucose levels are satisfactory but whose overall glycemic control (HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span>) is inadequate. The preprandial dose should be doubled up to 4 mg with each meal until satisfactory blood glucose response is achieved. At least one week should elapse to assess response after each dose adjustment.</p>
<p>The recommended dose range is 0.5 mg to 4 mg taken with meals. Repaglinide may be dosed preprandially 2, 3, or 4 times a day in response to changes in the patient’s meal pattern. The maximum recommended daily dose is 16 mg.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Patient Management</span></p>
<p>Long-term efficacy should be monitored by measurement of HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> levels approximately every 3 months. Failure to follow an appropriate dosage regimen may precipitate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span>. Patients who do not adhere to their prescribed dietary and drug regimen are more prone to exhibit unsatisfactory response to therapy including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. When <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> occurs in patients taking a combination of Repaglinide and a thiazolidinedione, the dose of Repaglinide should be reduced.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Patients Receiving Other Oral Hypoglycemic Agents</span></p>
<p>When Repaglinide is used to replace therapy with other oral hypoglycemic agents, Repaglinide may be started on the day after the final dose is given. Patients should then be observed carefully for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> due to potential overlapping of drug effects. When transferred from longer half-life sulfonylurea agents (e.g., chlorpropamide) to repaglinide, close monitoring may be indicated for up to one week or longer.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Combination Therapy</span></p>
<p>If Repaglinide monotherapy does not result in adequate glycemic control, a thiazolidinedione may be added. If thiazolidinedione monotherapy does not provide adequate control, Repaglinide may be added. The starting dose and dose adjustments for Repaglinide combination therapy is the same as for Repaglinide monotherapy. The dose of each drug should be carefully adjusted to determine the minimal dose required to achieve the desired pharmacologic effect. Failure to do so could result in an increase in the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemic episodes</span>. Appropriate monitoring of FPG and HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> measurements should be used to ensure that the patient is not subjected to excessive drug exposure or increased probability of secondary drug failure.<span class="Bold"></span></p>
