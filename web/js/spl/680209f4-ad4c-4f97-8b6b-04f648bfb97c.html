<h1>INDICATIONS &amp; USAGE</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>
Exforge HCT (amlodipine, valsartan, hydrochlorothiazide) is indicated for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">strokes</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarctions</span>. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes, including amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, and the ARB class to which valsartan principally belongs.  There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with Exforge HCT.
</p>
<p>
Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Programâ€™s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).
</p>
<p>
Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, but reductions in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. 
</p>
<p>
Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> (e.g., patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432867" conceptname="Hyperlipidemia">hyperlipidemia</span>), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. 
</p>
<p>
Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

<p>Excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span>, was seen in 1.7% of patients treated with the maximum dose of Exforge HCT (10/320/25 mg) compared to 1.8% of valsartan/HCTZ (320/25 mg) patients, 0.4% of amlodipine/valsartan (10/320 mg) patients, and 0.2% of HCTZ/amlodipine (25/10 mg) patients in a controlled trial in patients with moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4269635" conceptname="Hypertensive episode">uncomplicated hypertension</span>. In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume-Â or salt-depleted patients receiving high doses of diuretics, symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> may occur in patients receiving angiotensin receptor blockers. Correct this condition prior to administration of Exforge HCT.</p>
<p>Exforge HCT has not been studied in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, recent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>, or in patients undergoing surgery or dialysis. Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> or post-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> patients given valsartan commonly have some reduction in blood pressure, but discontinuation of therapy because of continuing symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> usually is not necessary when dosing instructions are followed. In controlled trials in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> patients, the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> in valsartan-treated patients was 5.5% compared to 1.8% in placebo-treated patients. In the Valsartan in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">Acute Myocardial Infarction</span> Trial (VALIANT), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> in post-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> patients led to permanent discontinuation of therapy in 1.4% of valsartan-treated patients and 0.8% of captopril-treated patients.</p>
<p>Since the vasodilation induced by amlodipine is gradual in onset, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">acute hypotension</span> has rarely been reported after oral administration. Do not initiate treatment with Exforge HCT in patients with aortic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315273" conceptname="Mitral valve stenosis">mitral stenosis</span> or obstructive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4124693" conceptname="Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy">hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</span>.</p>
<p>If excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> occurs with Exforge HCT, the patient should be placed in a supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized.</p>

In the active controlled clinical trial, discontinuation because of adverse events occurred in 4.0% of patients treated with Exforge HCT 10/320/25 mg compared to 2.9% of patients treated with valsartan/HCTZ 320/25 mg, 1.6% of patients treated with amlodipine/valsartan 10/320 mg, and 3.4% of patients treated with HCTZ/amlodipine 25/10 mg. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with Exforge HCT were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span> (1.0%) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> (0.7%).</p>
<p>The most frequent adverse events that occurred in the active controlled clinical trial in at least 2% of patients treated with Exforge HCT are presented in the following table.</p>

<h1>DRUG INTERACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>No drug interaction studies have been conducted with Exforge HCT and other drugs, although studies have been conducted with the individual components. A pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction study has been conducted to address the potential for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interaction</span> between the triple combination, Exforge HCT, and the corresponding 3 double combinations. No clinically relevant interaction was observed.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Amlodipine</span></p>
<p><span>Simvastatin:  </span>Coadministration of simvastatin with amlodipine increases the systemic exposure of simvastatin.  Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on amlodipine to 20 mg daily.</p>
<p><span>CYP3A4 Inhibitors:  </span>Coadministration with CYP3A inhibitors (moderate and strong) result in increased systemic exposure to amlodipine warranting dose reduction. Monitor for symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span> when amlodipine is coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors to determine the need for dose adjustment.</p>
<p><span>CYP3A4 Inducers: </span>No information is available on the quantitative effects of CYP3A4 inducers on amlodipine. Blood pressure should be monitored when amlodipine is coadministered with CYP3A4 inducers.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Valsartan</span></p>
<p>No clinically significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interactions</span> were observed when valsartan was coadministered with amlodipine, atenolol, cimetidine, digoxin, furosemide, glyburide, hydrochlorothiazide, or indomethacin. The valsartan-atenolol combination was more antihypertensive than either component, but it did not lower the heart rate more than atenolol alone.</p>
<p>In vitro metabolism studies have indicated that CYP450 mediated drug interaction between valsartan and coadministered drugs are unlikely because of the low extent of metabolism <span class="Italics">[see Pharmacokinetics â€“ Valsartan, (12.3)]</span>.</p>
<p>Coadministration of valsartan and warfarin did not change the pharmacokinetics of valsartan or the time-course of the anticoagulant properties of warfarin.</p>
<p><span>Potassium:  </span>Concomitant use of valsartan with other agents that block the renin-angiotensin system, potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride), potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium and in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> patients to increases in serum creatinine. If co-medication is considered necessary, monitoring of serum potassium is advisable. </p>
<p><span>Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors):  </span>In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including valsartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span>. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving valsartan and NSAID therapy.  </p>
<p>The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including valsartan may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.</p>
<p><span>Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS): </span>Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span>, and changes in renal function (including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span>) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on Exforge HCT and other agents that affect the RAS.</p>
<p>Do not coadminister aliskiren with Exforge HCT in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>. Avoid use of aliskiren with Exforge HCT in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (GFR &lt;60 mL/min).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Valsartan â€“ Hydrochlorothiazide</span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Lithium:</span>  Increases in serum lithium concentrations and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">lithium toxicity</span> have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists or thiazides.  Monitor lithium levels in patients taking Exforge HCT.
</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Hydrochlorothiazide</span></p>
<p>When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics:</p>
<p><span>Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin): </span>Dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.</p>
<p><span>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs and COX-2 selective inhibitors):  </span>When Exforge HCT and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of diuretic is obtained.</p>
<p><span>Carbamazepine: </span>May lead to symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4232311" conceptname="Hyponatremia">hyponatremia</span>.</p>
<p><span>Ion exchange resins: </span><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437643" conceptname="Abnormal gait">Staggering</span> the dosage of hydrochlorothiazide and ion exchange resins (e.g., cholestyramine, colestipol) such that hydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours before or 4 to 6 hours after the administration of resins would potentially minimize the interaction. <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span></p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Limited data are available related to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestations of overdosage would be <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span> could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Amlodipine</span></p>
<p>Single oral doses of amlodipine maleate equivalent to 40 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg amlodipine in mice and rats, respectively, caused <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span>. Single oral doses equivalent to 4 or more mg/kg amlodipine in dogs (11 or more times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) caused a marked peripheral vasodilation and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>.</p>
<p>Overdosage might be expected to cause excessive peripheral vasodilation with marked <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>. In humans, experience with intentional overdosage of amlodipine is limited. Marked and potentially prolonged systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> up to and including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span> with fatal outcome have been reported. </p>
<p>If massive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> should occur, initiate active cardiac and respiratory monitoring. Frequent blood pressure measurements are essential. Should <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> occur, initiate cardiovascular support including elevation of the extremities and the judicious administration of fluids. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> remains unresponsive to these conservative measures, consider administration of vasopressors (such as phenylephrine) with attention to circulating volume and urine output. As amlodipine is highly protein bound, hemodialysis is not likely to be of benefit.  Administration of activated charcoal to healthy volunteers immediately or up to two hours after ingestion of amlodipine has been shown to significantly decrease amlodipine absorption.  </p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>The active ingredients of Exforge HCT target 3 separate mechanisms involved in blood pressure regulation. Specifically, amlodipine blocks the contractile effects of calcium on cardiac and vascular smooth muscle cells; valsartan blocks the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137788" conceptname="Vascular constriction">vasoconstriction</span> and sodium retaining effects of angiotensin II on cardiac, vascular smooth muscle, adrenal and renal cells; and hydrochlorothiazide directly promotes the excretion of sodium and chloride in the kidney leading to reductions in intravascular volume. A more detailed description of the mechanism of action of each individual component follows.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Amlodipine</span></p>
<p>Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be detected in vitro but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine. Within the physiologic pH range, amlodipine is an ionized compound (pKa=8.6), and its kinetic interaction with the calcium channel receptor is characterized by a gradual rate of association and dissociation with the receptor binding site, resulting in a gradual onset of effect.</p>
<p>Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span> and reduction in blood pressure.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Valsartan</span></p>
<p>Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137788" conceptname="Vascular constriction">vasoconstriction</span>, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Valsartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.</p>
<p>There is also an AT<span class="Sub">2</span> receptor found in many tissues, but AT<span class="Sub">2</span> is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Valsartan has much greater affinity (about 20000-fold) for the AT<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor than for the AT<span class="Sub">2</span> receptor. The increased plasma levels of angiotensin following AT<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor blockade with valsartan may stimulate the unblocked AT<span class="Sub">2</span> receptor. The primary metabolite of valsartan is essentially inactive with an affinity for the AT<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor about one-200th that of valsartan itself.</p>
<p>Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because valsartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known. Valsartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.</p>
<p>Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of valsartan on blood pressure.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Hydrochlorothiazide</span></p>
<p>Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so coadministration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.</p>
<p>The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Exforge HCT has been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure. The 3 components of Exforge HCT (amlodipine, valsartan, hydrochlorothiazide) lower the blood pressure through complementary mechanisms, each working at a separate site and blocking different effector pathways. The pharmacodynamics of each individual component are described below.</p>
<p>Exforge HCT has not been studied in indications other than <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Amlodipine</span></p>
<p>Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, amlodipine produces vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing. Although the acute intravenous administration of amlodipine decreases arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in hemodynamic studies of patients with chronic stable angina, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical trials did not lead to clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressures in normotensive patients with angina.</p>
<p>With chronic, once-daily administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with amlodipine is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation; thus, individuals with moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> (diastolic pressure 105-114 mmHg) had about a 50% greater response than patients with mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> (diastolic pressure 90-104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressure (+1/-2 mmHg).</p>
<p>In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span> and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow without change in filtration fraction or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75650" conceptname="Proteinuria">proteinuria</span>.</p>
<p>As with other calcium channel blockers, hemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have generally demonstrated a small increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208254" conceptname="Cardiac index">cardiac index</span> without significant influence on dP/dt or on left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In hemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and man, even when coadministered with beta-blockers to man. Similar findings, however, have been observed in normals or well-compensated patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> with agents possessing significant negative inotropic effects.</p>
<p>Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals or man. In patients with chronic stable angina, intravenous administration of 10 mg did not significantly alter A-H and H-V conduction and sinus node recovery time after pacing. Similar results were obtained in patients receiving amlodipine and concomitant beta-blockers. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta-blockers to patients with either <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> or angina, no adverse effects of electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters were observed. In clinical trials with angina patients alone, amlodipine therapy did not alter ECG intervals or produce higher degrees of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316135" conceptname="Atrioventricular block">AV blocks</span>.</p>
<p>Amlodipine has indications other than <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> which are described in its full prescribing information.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Valsartan</span></p>
<p>Valsartan inhibits the pressor effect of angiotensin II infusions. An oral dose of 80 mg inhibits the pressor effect by about 80% at peak with approximately 30% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. No information on the effect of larger doses is available.</p>
<p>Removal of the negative feedback of angiotensin II causes a 2- to 3-fold rise in plasma renin and consequent rise in angiotensin II plasma concentration in hypertensive patients. Minimal decreases in plasma aldosterone were observed after administration of valsartan; very little effect on serum potassium was observed.</p>
<p>Administration of valsartan to patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320128" conceptname="Essential hypertension">essential hypertension</span> results in a significant reduction of sitting, supine, and standing systolic blood pressure, usually with little or no orthostatic change.</p>

<p>After oral administration of hydrochlorothiazide, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span> begins within 2 hours, peaks in about 4 hours and lasts about 6 to 12 hours.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">Exforge HCT</span></p>
<p>Following oral administration of Exforge HCT in normal healthy adults, peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine, valsartan and HCTZ are reached in about 6 hours, 3 hours, and 2 hours, respectively. The rate and extent of absorption of amlodipine, valsartan and HCTZ from Exforge HCT are the same as when administered as individual dosage forms.</p>
<p>The bioavailability of amlodipine, valsartan, and HCTZ were not altered when Exforge HCT was administered with food.   Exforge HCT may be administered with or without food.  </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Amlodipine</span></p>
<p>Peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine are reached 6 to 12 hours after administration of amlodipine alone. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated to be between 64% and 90%. The apparent volume of distribution of amlodipine is 21 L/kg. Approximately 93% of circulating amlodipine is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients.</p>
<p>Amlodipine is extensively (about 90%) converted to inactive metabolites via hepatic metabolism with 10% of the parent compound and 60% of the metabolites excreted in the urine.</p>
<p>Elimination of amlodipine from the plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination half-life of about 30 to 50 hours. Steady state plasma levels of amlodipine are reached after 7 to 8 days of consecutive daily dosing. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Valsartan</span></p>
<p>Following oral administration of valsartan alone peak plasma concentrations of valsartan are reached in 2 to 4 hours. Absolute bioavailability is aboutÂ 25% (range 10% to 35%).</p>
<p>The steady state volume of distribution of valsartan after intravenous administration is 17 L indicating that valsartan does not distribute into tissues extensively. Valsartan is highly bound to serum proteins (95%), mainly serum albumin.</p>
<p>Valsartan shows biexponential decay kinetics following intravenous administration with an average elimination half-life of about 6 hours. The recovery is mainly as unchanged drug, with only about 20% of dose recovered as metabolites. The primary metabolite, accounting for about 9% of dose, is valeryl 4-hydroxy valsartan. In vitro metabolism studies involving recombinant CYP450 enzymes indicated that the CYP2C9 isoenzyme is responsible for the formation of valeryl-4-hydroxy valsartan.Â Valsartan does not inhibit CYP450 isozymes at clinically relevant concentrations. CYP450 mediated drug interaction between valsartan and coadministered drugs are unlikely because of the low extent of metabolism.</p>
<p>Valsartan, when administered as an oral solution, is primarily recovered in feces (about 83% of dose) and urine (about 13% of dose). Following intravenous administration, plasma clearance of valsartan is about 2 L/h and its renal clearance is 0.62 L/h (about 30% of total clearance).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Hydrochlorothiazide</span></p>
<p>The estimated absolute bioavailability of hydrochlorothiazide after oral administration is about 70%. Peak plasma hydrochlorothiazide concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) are reached within 2 to 5 hours after oral administration. There is no clinically significant effect of food on the bioavailability of hydrochlorothiazide. </p>
<p>Hydrochlorothiazide binds to albumin (40% to 70%) and distributes into erythrocytes. Following oral administration, plasma hydrochlorothiazide concentrations decline biexponentially, with a mean distribution half-life of about 2 hours and an elimination half-life of about 10 hours. </p>
<p>About 70% of an orally administered dose of hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated in the urine as unchanged drug. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Special Populations</span></p>
<p><span>Geriatric: </span>Elderly patients have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase in peak plasma levels, elimination half-life, and AUC. Exposure (measured by AUC) to valsartan is higher by 70% and the half-life is longer by 35% in the elderly than in the young. Limited amount of data suggest that the systemic clearance of hydrochlorothiazide is reduced in both healthy and hypertensive elderly subjects compared to young healthy volunteers. </p>

<h1>NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p><span>Studies with amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide</span><span class="Bold">:</span> No carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, or fertility studies have been conducted with this combination. However, these studies have been conducted for amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide alone. Based on the preclinical safety and human pharmacokinetic studies, there is no indication of any toxicologically significant adverse interaction between these components.</p>
<p><span>Studies with amlodipine:</span><span class="Italics">Â </span>Rats and mice treated with amlodipine maleate in the diet for up toÂ two years, at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mgÂ amlodipine/kg/day, showed no evidence of a carcinogenic effect of the drug. For the mouse,Â the highest dose was, on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>Â basis, similar to the MRHD of 10 mg amlodipine/day. For the rat, the highest dose was, on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis, aboutÂ 2.5 times the MRHD. (Calculations based on a 60 kg patient.)</p>
<p>Mutagenicity studies conducted with amlodipine maleate revealed no drug-related effects atÂ either the gene or chromosome level.</p>
<p>There was no effect on the fertility of rats treated orally with amlodipine maleate (males forÂ 64 days and females for 14 days prior to mating) at doses of up to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/dayÂ (about 10 times the MRHD of 10 mg/day on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis).</p>
<p><span>Studies with valsartan:</span><span class="Italics">Â </span>There was no evidence of carcinogenicity when valsartan wasÂ administered in the diet to mice and rats for up to 2 years at concentrations calculated toÂ provide doses of up to 160 and 200 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses in mice and rats areÂ about 2.4 and 6 times, respectively, the MRHD of 320 mg/day on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>Â basis.Â (Calculations based on a 60 kg patient.)</p>
<p>Mutagenicity assays did not reveal any valsartan-related effects at either the gene orÂ chromosome level. These assays included bacterial mutagenicity tests with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span> and E.Â coli, a gene mutation test with Chinese hamster V79 cells, a cytogenetic test with ChineseÂ hamster ovary cells, and a rat micronucleus test.</p>
<p>Valsartan had no adverse effects on the reproductive performance of male or female rats atÂ oral doses of up to 200 mg/kg/day. This dose is about 6 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>Â basis.</p>
<p><span>Studies with hydrochlorothiazide</span><span>: </span>Two-year feeding studies in mice and rats conducted under the auspices of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) uncovered no evidence of a carcinogenic potential of hydrochlorothiazide in female mice (at doses of up to approximately 600Â mg/kg/day) or in male and female rats (at doses of up to approximately 100Â mg/kg/day). The NTP, however, found equivocal evidence for hepatocarcinogenicity in male mice.</p>
<p>Hydrochlorothiazide was not genotoxic <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>in the Ames mutagenicity assay of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span> Typhimurium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> TAÂ 98, TA 100, TA 1535, TA 1537, and TA 1538 and in the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) test for chromosomal aberrations, or <span class="Italics">in vivo </span>in assays using mouse germinal cell chromosomes, Chinese hamster bone marrow chromosomes, and the Drosophila sex-linked recessive lethal trait gene.

<p>Hydrochlorothiazide had no adverse effects on the fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies wherein these species were exposed via diet at doses of up to 100 and 4Â mg/kg, respectively, prior to mating and throughout gestation. These doses of hydrochlorothiazide in mice and rats are 19 and 1.5 times, respectively, the MRHD on aÂ mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis.

(Calculations based on a patient weight of 60 kg.) However, litter size was significantly decreased (by about 50%) and the number of intrauterine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> was significantly increased (about 5-fold) for rats receiving amlodipine maleate at a dose equivalent to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day for 14 days before mating and throughout mating and gestation. Amlodipine maleate has been shown to prolong both the gestation period and the duration of labor in rats at this dose. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women.</p>
<p><span>Studies with valsartan:</span><span class="Italics">Â </span>No teratogenic effects were observed when valsartan was administeredÂ to pregnant mice and rats at oral doses of up to 600 mg/kg/day and to pregnant rabbits at oral doses of up to 10 mg/kg/day.

In rabbits, fetotoxicity (i.e., resorptions, litter loss, abortions, andÂ low body weight) associated with maternal toxicity (mortality) was observed at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg/day. The no observed adverse effect doses of 600, 200 and 2 mg/kg/day in mice, rats and rabbits, respectively, are about 9, 6 and 0.1 times the MRHD of 320 mg/day on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Exforge HCT was studied in a double-blind, active controlled study in hypertensive patients. A total of 2271 patients with moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> (mean baseline systolic/diastolic blood pressure was 170/107 mmHg) received treatments of amlodipine/valsartan/HCTZ 10/320/25 mg,Â valsartan/HCTZ 320/25 mg, amlodipine/valsartan 10/320 mg, or HCTZ/amlodipine 25/10 mg. At study initiation patients assigned to the 2-component arms received lower doses of their treatment combination while patients assigned to the Exforge HCT arm received 160/12.5 mg valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide. After 1 week, Exforge HCT patients were titrated to 5/160/12.5 mg amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, while all other patients continued receiving their initial doses. After 2 weeks, all patients were titrated to their full treatment dose. A total of 55% of patients were male, 14%Â were 65 years or older, 72% were Caucasian, and 17% were black.</p>
<p>At week 8, the triple combination therapy produced greater reductions in blood pressure than each of the 3 dual combination treatments (p&lt;0.0001 for both diastolic and systolic blood pressures reductions). The reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure with Exforge HCT were 7.6/5.0 mmHg greater than with valsartan/HCTZ, 6.2/3.3 mmHg greater than with amlodipine/valsartan, and 8.2/5.3 mmHg greater than with amlodipine/HCTZ (see Figure 1). The full blood pressure lowering effect was achieved 2 weeks after being on the maximal dose of Exforge HCT (see Figure 2 and Figure 3). As the pivotal study was an active-controlled trial, the treatment effects shown in Figures 1, 2, and 3 include a placebo effect of unknown size.</p>

<p>Tell your doctor if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">How should I store EXFORGE HCT?</span></p>

</ul>
<p><span class="Bold">Keep EXFORGE HCT and all medicines out of the reach of children.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">General Information about EXFORGE HCT</span></p>
<p>Medicines are sometimes prescribed for conditions that are not mentioned in the patient information leaflet. Do not use EXFORGE HCT for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give EXFORGE HCT to other people, even if they have the same symptoms that you have. It may harm them. </p>
<p>This patient information leaflet summarizes the most important information about EXFORGE HCT. If you would like more information about EXFORGE HCT, talk with your doctor. You can ask your doctor or pharmacist for information about EXFORGE HCT that is written for health professionals. For more information go to www.EXFORGE.com or call 1-888-839-3674.Â </p>
<p><span class="Bold">What are the ingredients in EXFORGE HCT?</span></p>
<p>Active ingredients: amlodipine besylate, valsartan, and hydrochlorothiazide</p>
<p>The inactive ingredients of all strengths of the tablets are crospovidone, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, and colloidal anhydrous silica. The film coating contains hypromellose, talc, macrogol 4000, and may contain titanium dioxide or yellow and red iron oxides.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What is high blood pressure (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>)?</span></p>
<p>Blood pressure is the force of blood in your blood vessels when your heart beats and when your heart rests. You have high blood pressure when the force is too much. EXFORGE HCT can help your blood vessels relax so your blood pressure is lower. Medicines that lower blood pressure lower your chance of having a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</span>. </p>
<p>High blood pressure makes the heart work harder to pump blood throughout the body and causes damage to blood vessels. If high blood pressure is not treated, it can lead to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">kidney failure</span>, and vision problems. </p>
