<h1> DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (Reteplase) is a non-glycosylated deletion mutein of tissue <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4238994" conceptname="Plasminogen assay">plasminogen</span> activator (tPA), containing the kringle 2 and the protease domains of human tPA. Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> contains 355 of the 527 amino acids of native tPA (amino acids 1-3 and 176-527). Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> is produced by recombinant DNA technology in E. coli. The protein is isolated as inactive inclusion bodies from E. coli, converted into its active form by an in vitro folding process and purified by chromatographic separation. The molecular weight of Reteplase is 39,571 daltons.</p>
<p>Potency is expressed in units (U) using a reference standard which is specific for Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> and is not comparable with units used for other thrombolytic agents.</p>
<p>Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> is a sterile, white, lyophilized powder for intravenous bolus injection after reconstitution with Sterile Water for Injection, USP (without preservatives). Following reconstitution, the pH is 6.0 Â± 0.3. Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> is supplied as a 10.4 unit vial to ensure sufficient drug for administration of each 10 unit injection. Each single-use vial contains:</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Studies:</span> The safety and efficacy of Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> were evaluated in three controlled clinical trials in which Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> was compared to other thrombolytic agents. The INJECT study was designed to assess the relative effects of Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> or the Streptase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> brand of Streptokinase upon mortality rates at 35 days following an AMI. The other studies (RAPID 1 and RAPID 2) were arteriographic studies which compared the effect on coronary patency of Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> to two regimens of Alteplase (a tissue <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4238994" conceptname="Plasminogen assay">plasminogen</span> activator; Activase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> in the  USA and Actilyse<span class="Sup">Â®</span> in  Europe) in patients with an AMI. In all three studies, patients were treated with aspirin (initial doses of 160 mg to 350 mg and subsequent doses of 75 mg to 350 mg) and heparin (a 5,000 unit IV bolus prior to the administration of Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span>, followed by a 1000 unit/hour continuous IV infusion for at least 24 hours).<span class="Sup">3,4,5</span> The safety and efficacy of Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> have not been evaluated using antithrombotic or antiplatelet regimens other than those described above.</p>
<p>Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (10 + 10 unit) was compared to Streptokinase (1.5 million units over 60 minutes) in a double-blind, randomized, European study (INJECT), which studied 6,010 patients treated within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms of AMI. To be eligible for enrollment, patients had to have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77670" conceptname="Chest pain">chest pain</span> consistent with coronary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4200991" conceptname="Ischemia">ischemia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4295129" conceptname="ST segment elevation">ST segment elevation</span>, or a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313791" conceptname="Bundle branch block">bundle branch block</span> pattern on the EKG.

<p>For mortality, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> and the combined outcome of mortality or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, the 95% confidence intervals in Table 1 reflect the range within which the true difference in outcomes probably lies and includes the possibility of no difference. The incidences of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span> and of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198571" conceptname="Cardiogenic shock">cardiogenic shock</span> were significantly lower among patients treated with Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span>.</p>
<p>The total incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> was similar between the groups. However, more patients treated with Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> experienced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4046362" conceptname="Hemorrhagic cerebral infarction">hemorrhagic strokes</span> than patients treated with Streptokinase. An exploratory analysis indicated that the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439847" conceptname="Intracranial hemorrhage">intracranial hemorrhage</span> was higher among older patients or those with elevated blood pressure. The incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439847" conceptname="Intracranial hemorrhage">intracranial hemorrhage</span> among the 698 patients treated with Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> who were older than 70 years was 2.2%. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439847" conceptname="Intracranial hemorrhage">Intracranial hemorrhage</span> occurred in 8 of the 332 (2.4%) patients treated with Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> who had an initial systolic blood pressure &gt;160 mm Hg and in 15 of the 2,629 (0.6%) Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> patients who had an initial systolic blood pressure &lt;160 mm Hg.</p>
<p>Two arteriographic studies (RAPID 1 and RAPID 2) were performed utilizing open-label administration of the study agents and a blinded review of the arteriograms. In RAPID 1, patients were treated within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms, and in RAPID 2, patients were treated within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms. Both studies evaluated coronary artery perfusion through the infarct-related artery 90 minutes after the initiation of therapy as the primary endpoint. Some patients in each study also had perfusion through the infarct-related artery evaluated at 60 minutes after the initiation of therapy. In RAPID 1, Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (in doses of 10 + 10 unit, 15 unit, or 10 + 5 unit) was compared to a 3 hour regimen of Alteplase (100 mg administered over 3 hrs).In RAPID 2, Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (10 + 10 unit) was compared to an accelerated regimen of Alteplase (100 mg administered over 1.5 hrs). The percentages of patients with partial or complete flow (TIMI grades 2 or 3) and complete flow (TIMI grade 3), are shown along with ventricular function assessments in Table 2. The follow-up arteriogram was performed at a median of 8 (RAPID 1) and 5 (RAPID 2) days following the administration of the thrombolytics. In RAPID 1 the best patency results were obtained with the 10 + 10 unit dose. In RAPID 2, the percentage of patients with partial or complete flow and the percentage of patients with complete flow was significantly higher with Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> than with Alteplase at 90 minutes after the initiation of therapy. In both clinical trials the reocclusion rates were similar for Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> and Alteplase. The relationship between coronary artery patency and clinical efficacy has not been established.</p>
<p>Approximately 70% (RAPID 1) and 78% (RAPID 2) of the patients in the arteriographic studies underwent optional arteriography at 60 minutes following the administration of the study agents. In both trials the percentage of patients with complete flow at 60 minutes was significantly higher with Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> than with Alteplase. Neither RAPID clinical trial was designed nor powered to compare the efficacy or safety of Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> and Alteplase with respect to the outcomes of mortality and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>.</p>

<h2></h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">Bleeding</span>:</span> The most common complication encountered during Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> therapy is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>. The sites of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> include both internal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> sites (intracranial, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or respiratory) and superficial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> sites (venous cutdowns, arterial punctures, sites of recent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4121697" conceptname="Surgery">surgical intervention</span>). The concomitant use of heparin anticoagulation may contribute to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>. In clinical trials some of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">hemorrhage</span> episodes occurred one or more days after the effects of Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> had dissipated, but while heparin therapy was continuing.</p>
<p>As fibrin is lysed during Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> therapy, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> from recent puncture sites may occur. Therefore, thrombolytic therapy requires careful attention to all potential <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> sites (including catheter insertion sites, arterial and venous puncture sites, cutdown sites, and needle puncture sites). Noncompressible arterial puncture must be avoided and internal jugular and subclavian venous punctures should be avoided to minimize <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> from noncompressible sites.</p>
<p>Should an arterial puncture be necessary during the administration of Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span>, it is preferable to use an upper extremity vessel that is accessible to manual compression. Pressure should be applied for at least 30 minutes, a pressure dressing applied, and the puncture site checked frequently for evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>.</p>
<p>Intramuscular injections and nonessential handling of the patient should be avoided during treatment with Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span>. Venipunctures should be performed carefully and only as required.</p>
<p>Should serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> (not controllable by local pressure) occur, concomitant anticoagulant therapy should be terminated immediately. In addition, the second bolus of Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> should not be given if serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> occurs before it is administered.</p>
<p>Each patient being considered for therapy with Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> should be carefully evaluated and anticipated benefits weighed against the potential risks associated with therapy. In the following conditions, the risks of Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> therapy may be increased and should be weighed against the anticipated benefits:</p>

<h1> DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (Reteplase) is for intravenous administration only. Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> is administered as a 10 + 10 unit double-bolus injection. Two 10 unit bolus injections are required for a complete treatment. Each bolus is administered as an intravenous injection over 2 minutes. The second bolus is given 30 minutes after initiation of the first bolus injection. Each bolus injection should be given via an intravenous line in which no other medication is being simultaneously injected or infused. No other medication should be added to the injection solution containing Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span>. There is no experience with patients receiving repeat courses of therapy with Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span>. <span class="Bold">Heparin and Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> are incompatible when combined in solution. </span>Do not administer heparin and Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> simultaneously in the same intravenous line.</p>
<p>If Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> is to be injected through an intravenous line containing heparin, a normal saline or 5% dextrose (D5W) solution should be <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318566" conceptname="Flushing">flushed</span> through the line prior to and following the Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> injection.</p>
<p>Although the value of anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs during and following administration of Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> has not been studied, heparin has been administered concomitantly in more than 99% of patients. Aspirin has been given either during and/or following heparin treatment. Studies assessing the safety and efficacy of Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> without adjunctive therapy with heparin and aspirin have not been performed.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Reconstitution â€“ Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> Kit and Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> Half-Kit:</span> Reconstitution should be carried out using the diluent and dispensing pin provided with Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span>. It is important that Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> be reconstituted only with the supplied Sterile Water for Injection, USP (without preservatives). The reconstituted preparation results in a colorless solution containing Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> 1 unit/mL. Slight foaming upon reconstitution is not unusual; allowing the vial to stand undisturbed for several minutes is usually sufficient to allow dissipation of any large bubbles.</p>
<p>Because Retavase<span class="Sup">Â®</span> contains no antibacterial preservatives, it should be reconstituted immediately before use. When reconstituted as directed, the solution may be used within 4 hours when stored at 2-30Â°C (36-86Â°F). Prior to administration, the product should be visually inspected for particulate matter and discoloration.</p>
