<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Hydrocodone is a semisynthetic narcotic analgesic and antitussive with multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of codeine. Most of these involve the central nervous</p>
<p>system and smooth muscle. The precise mechanism of action of hydrocodone and other opiates</p>
<p>is not known, although it is believed to relate to the existence of opiate receptors in the central</p>
<p>nervous system. In addition to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, narcotics may produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, changes in mood and</p>
<p>mental clouding. The analgesic action of acetaminophen involves peripheral influences, but the specific mechanism is as yet undetermined. Antipyretic activity is mediated through hypothalamic heat regulating centers. Acetaminophen inhibits prostaglandin synthetase.</p>
<p>Therapeutic doses of acetaminophen have negligible effects on the cardiovascular or respiratory</p>
<p>systems; however, toxic doses may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443240" conceptname="Collapse">circulatory failure</span> and rapid, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302536" conceptname="Shallow breathing">shallow breathing</span>.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics:</h2>
<p class="First">The behavior of the individual components is described below.</p>
<p>Hydrocodone: Following a 10 mg oral dose of hydrocodone administered to five adult male subjects, the mean peak concentration was 23.6 Â± 5.2 ng/mL. Maximum serum levels were achieved at 1.3 Â± 0.3 hours and the half-life was determined to be 3.8 Â± 0.3 hours.</p>
<p>Hydrocodone exhibits a complex pattern of metabolism including Odemethylation,</p>
<p>N-demethylation and 6-keto reduction to the corresponding 6-âŒ©- and 6-Â®-hydroxymetabolites.</p>
<p>See <span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE </span>for toxicity information.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen: Acetaminophen is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal</p>
<p>tract and is distributed throughout most body tissues. The plasma half-life is 1.25</p>
<p>to 3 hours, but may be increased by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver damage</span> and following overdosage. Elimination of acetaminophen is principally by liver metabolism (conjugation) and subsequent renal excretion of</p>
<p>metabolites. Approximately 85% of an oral dose appears in the urine within 24 hours of administration, most as the glucuronide conjugate, with small amounts of other conjugates and unchanged drug. See <span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE </span>for toxicity information.</p>

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Hydrocodone, like all narcotics, may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery; patients should be cautioned accordingly. Alcohol and other CNS depressants may produce an additive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span>, when taken with this combination product, and should be avoided.</p>
<p>Hydrocodone may be habit-forming. Patients should take the drug only for as long as it is prescribed, in the amounts prescribed, and no more frequently than prescribed.</p>

<h2>Labor and Delivery</h2>
<p class="First">As with all narcotics, administration of this product to the mother shortly before delivery may  result in some degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> in the newborn, especially if higher doses are used.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Acetaminophen is excreted in breast milk in small amounts, but the significance of its effects on nursing infants is not known. It is not known whether hydrocodone is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from hydrocodone and acetaminophen, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of</p>
<p>the drug to the mother.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>
<p>Hydrocodone and the major metabolites of acetaminophen are known to be substantially excreted</p>
<p>by the kidney. Thus the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal  function due to the accumulation of the parent compound and/or metabolites in the plasma.  Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Hydrocodone may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span></p>
<p>and over-sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of</p>
<p>hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets and observed closely.</p>

Clinical and laboratory evidence of hepatic toxicity may not be apparent until 48 to 72 hours post-ingestion. In adults, hepatic toxicity has rarely been reported with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">acute overdoses</span> of less than 10 grams, or fatalities with less than 15 grams.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Treatment: </span>A single or multiple <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> with hydrocodone and acetaminophen is a potentially</p>
<p>lethal polydrug <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, and consultation with a regional poison control center is recommended.</p>
<p>Immediate treatment includes support of cardiorespiratory function and measures to reduce drug</p>
<p>absorption. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">Vomiting</span> should be induced mechanically, or with syrup of ipecac, if the patient is alert (adequate pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes). Oral activated charcoal (1 g/kg) should follow gastric emptying. The first dose should be accompanied by an appropriate cathartic. If repeated doses are used, the cathartic might be included with alternate doses as required. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> is usually hypovolemic and should respond to fluids. Vasopressors and other supportive</p>

<p>Meticulous attention should be given to maintaining adequate pulmonaryventilation. In severe cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>, peritoneal dialysis, or preferably hemodialysis may be considered. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4253058" conceptname="Factor II deficiency">hypoprothrombinemia</span> occurs due to acetaminophen <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, vitamin K should be administered intravenously.

Naloxone hydrochloride 0.4 mg to 2 mg is given parenterally.</p>
<p>Since the duration of action of hydrocodone may exceed that of the naloxone, the patient should be kept under continuous surveillance and repeated doses of the antagonist should be administered as needed to maintain adequate respiration. A narcotic antagonist should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratoryor cardiovascular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.</p>
<p>If the dose of acetaminophen may have exceeded 140 mg/kg, acetylcysteine should be administered as early as possible. Serum acetaminophen</p>
<p>levels should be obtained, since levels four or more hours following ingestion help</p>
<p>predict acetaminophen toxicity. Do not await acetaminophen assay results before initiating treatment. Hepatic enzymes should be obtained initially, and repeated at 24-hour intervals.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">Methemoglobinemia</span> over 30% should be treated with methylene blue by slow intravenous administration. The toxic dose for adults for acetaminophen is 10 g.</p>
