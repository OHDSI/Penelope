<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Isosorbide mononitrate is 1,4:3,6-dianhydro-D-glucitol, 5-nitrate, an organic nitrate whose structural formula is:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="Image from Drug Label Content" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=EC09AB1C-52FA-4F41-BF65-A632DCE8F097&amp;name=ISMO1.jpg"></div>
<p>and whose molecular weight is 191.14. The organic nitrates are vasodilators, active on both arteries and veins. 
							Each Ismo<span class="Sup">Â®</span> tablet contains 20 mg of isosorbide mononitrate. The inactive ingredients in each tablet are colloidal 
							silicon dioxide, D&amp;C Yellow 10 Aluminum Lake, FD&amp;C Yellow 6 Aluminum Lake, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, lactose, 
							magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate 20, povidone, sodium starch glycolate, titanium 
							dioxide and hydroxypropyl cellulose.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Isosorbide mononitrate is the major active metabolite of isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), and most of the clinical activity of the 				dinitrate is attributable to the mononitrate.</p>
<p> The principal pharmacological action of isosorbide mononitrate, due to its nitric oxide metabolite, is direct relaxation of 
							vascular smooth muscle. The result is dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilation of the veins promotes 
							peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and 
							pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span>, systolic arterial pressure,
							and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, 
							afterload reduction, and coronary dilatation remains undefined.</p>

<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">Dosing regimens for most chronically used drugs are designed to provide plasma concentrations that are 
									continu-ously greater than a minimally effective concentration. This strategy is inappropriate for organic nitrates. 
									Several well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the antianginal efficacy of continuously 
									delivered nitrates. In the large majority of these trials, active agents were indistinguishable from placebo after 24 
									hours (or less) of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in 
									excess of those used acutely, have consistently failed. Only after nitrates have been absent from the body for several
									hours has their antianginal efficacy been restored. The drug-free interval sufficient to avoid tolerance to isosorbide 
									mononitrate has not been completely defined. In the only regimen of twice-daily isosorbide mononitrate that has 
									been shown to avoid development of tolerance, the two doses of Ismo tablets are given 7 hours apart, so there is a 
									gap of 17 hours between the second dose of each day and the first dose of the next day. Taking account of the relatively
									long half-life of isosorbide mononitrate this result is consistent with those obtained for other organic nitrates. The same
									twice-daily regimen of Ismo tablets successfully avoided significant rebound/withdrawal effects. The incidence and 
									magnitude of such phenomena have appeared, in studies of other nitrates, to be highly dependent upon the schedule 
									of nitrate administration.</p>
</div>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">In humans, isosorbide mononitrate is not subject to first pass metabolism in the liver. The absolute bioavailability 
									of isosorbide mononitrate from Ismo tablets is nearly 100%. Maximum serum concentrations of isosorbide mononitrate
									are achieved 30 to 60 minutes after ingestion of Ismo. The volume of distribution of isosorbide mononitrate is 
									approximately 0.6 L/kg, and less than 4% is bound to plasma proteins. It is cleared from the serum by denitration to 
									isosorbide; glucuronidation to the mononitrate glucuronide; and denitration/hydration to sorbitol. None of these 
									metabolites is vasoactive. Less than 1% of administered isosorbide mononitrate is eliminated in the urine. The overall 
									elimination half-life of isosorbide mononitrate is about 5 hours; the rate of clearance is the same in healthy young adults
									, in patients with various degrees of renal, hepatic, or cardiac dysfunction, and in the elderly. In a single-dose study, the 
									pharmacokinetics of isosorbide mononitrate were dose-proportional up to at least 60 mg.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-3.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Clinical Trials</h2>
<p class="First">Controlled trials of single doses of Ismo tablets have demonstrated that antianginal activity is present about 1 hour 
									after dosing, with peak effect seen from 1 to 4 hours after dosing. In placebo-controlled trials lasting 2 to 3 weeks, 
									Ismo tablets were administered twice daily, in asymmetric regimens (with interdosing intervals of 7 and 17 hours) 
									designed to avoid tolerance. One trial tested doses of 10 mg and 20 mg; one trial tested doses of 20 mg, 40 mg, and 
									60 mg; and three trials tested only doses of 20 mg. In each trial, the subjects were persons with known chronic stable 
									angina, and the primary measure of efficacy was exercise tolerance on a standardized treadmill test. After initial dosing 
									and for at least 3 weeks, exercise tolerance in patients treated with Ismo 20 mg tablets was significantly greater than 
									that seen in patients treated with placebo, although there was some attenuation of effect with time. Treatment with Ismo 
									tablets was superior to placebo for at least 12 hours after the first dose (i.e., 5 hours after the second dose) of each day.
									Significant tolerance and rebound phenomena were not observed. The 10-mg dose was not unequivocally superior to 
									placebo, while the effect of the 40-mg dose was similar to that of the 20-mg dose. The 60-mg dose appeared to be less
									effective, and it was associated with a rebound phenomenon (early-morning worsening).</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, particularly with upright posture, may occur with even small doses of isosorbide 
									mononitrate. This drug should therefore be used with caution in patients who may be volume depleted or who, for

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Patients should be told that the antianginal efficacy of Ismo tablets can be maintained by carefully following 
									the prescribed schedule of dosing (two doses taken 7 hours apart). For most patients, this can be accomplished 
									by taking the first dose on awakening and the second dose 7 hours later. As with other nitrates, daily <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headaches</span> 
									sometimes accompany treatment with isosorbide mononitrate. In patients who get these <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headaches</span>, the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headaches</span>
									are a marker of the activity of the drug. Patients should resist the temptation to avoid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headaches</span> by altering the 
									schedule of their treatment with isosorbide mononitrate, since loss of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> may be associated with simultaneous
									loss of antianginal efficacy. Aspirin and/or acetaminophen, on the other hand, often successfully relieve isosorbide 
									mononitrate-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headaches</span> with no deleterious effect on isosorbide mononitrateâ€™s antianginal efficacy. Treatment
									with isosorbide mononitrate may be associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">lightheadedness</span> on standing, especially just after rising from a 
									recumbent or seated position. This effect may be more frequent in patients who have also consumed alcohol.</p>

<a name="section-7.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Drug Interactions:</h2>
<p class="First">The vasodilating effects of isosorbide mononitrate may be additive with those of other vasodilators. Alcohol, in 
									particular, has been found to exhibit additive effects of this variety. Marked symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span> has 
									been reported when calcium channel blockers and organic nitrates were used in combination. Dose adjustments of 
									either class of agents may be necessary.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:</h2>
<p class="First">No carcinogenic effects were observed in mice exposed to oral isosorbide mononitrate for 104 weeks at doses of 
									up to 900 mg/kg/day (102 X the human exposure comparing body surface area). Rats treated with 900 mg/kg/day for 26
									weeks (225 X the human exposure comparing body surface area) and 500 mg/kg/day for the remaining 95 to 111 weeks
									(males and females, respectively) showed no evidence of tumors. No mutagenic activity was seen in a variety of <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>
									and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> assays. No adverse effects on fertility were observed when 
									isosorbide mononitrate was administered to 
									male and female rats at doses of up to 500 mg/kg/day (125 X the human exposure comparing body surface area).</p>

<h2>Pregnancy Category C</h2>
<p class="First">Isosorbide mononitrate has been shown to be associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443213" conceptname="Stillbirth">stillbirths</span> and neonatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> in rats receiving 500 
									mg/kg/day of isosorbide mononitrate (125 X the human exposure comparing body surface area). At 250 mg/kg/day, no 
									adverse effects on reproduction and development were reported. In rats and rabbits receiving isosorbide mononitrate at 
									up to 250 mg/kg/day, no developmental abnormalities, fetal abnormalities, or other effects upon reproductive 
									performance were detected; these doses are larger than the maximum recommended human dose by factors between 
									70 (body-surface-area basis in rabbits) and 310 (body-weight basis, either species). In rats receiving 500 mg/kg/day, 
									there were small but statistically significant increases in the rates of prolonged gestation, prolonged parturition, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443213" conceptname="Stillbirth">stillbirth</span>, 
									and neonatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>; and there were small but statistically significant decreases in birth weight, live litter size, and pup 
									survival.</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Isosorbide mononitrate should be used 
									during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers:</h2>
<p class="First">It is not known whether isosorbide mononitrate is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in 
									human milk, caution should be exercised when isosorbide mononitrate is administered to a nursing woman.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of Ismo<span class="Sup">Â®</span> did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether 
									they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in 
									responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be 
									cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, although age, renal, hepatic or cardiac dysfunction do not 
									appear to have a clinically significant effect on the clearance of Ismo<span class="Sup">Â®</span>.</p>

<p>Laboratory determinations of serum levels of isosorbide mononitrate and its metabolites are not widely 
									available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of isosorbide 
									mononitrate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. There are no data suggesting what dose of isosorbide mononitrate is likely to be 
									life-threatening in humans. In rats and mice, there is significant lethality at doses of 2000 mg/kg and 3000 mg/kg, 
									respectively. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the 
									urine) that might accelerate elimination of isosorbide mononitrate. In particular, dialysis is known to be ineffective 
									in removing isosorbide mononitrate from the body. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of isosorbide 
									mononitrate is known, and no intervention has been subject to controlled study as a therapy of isosorbide 
									mononitrate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. Because the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> associated with isosorbide mononitrate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> is the result 
									of venodilatation and arterial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436375" conceptname="Hypovolemia">hypovolemia</span>, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward an increase 
									in central fluid volume. Passive elevation of the patientâ€™s legs may be sufficient, but intravenous infusion of 
									normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. The use of epinephrine or other arterial vasoconstrictors in 
									this setting is likely to do more harm than good. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>, therapy 
									resulting in central volume expansion is not without hazard. Treatment of isosorbide mononitrate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> in 
									these patients may be subtle and difficult, and invasive monitoring may be required.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">Methemoglobinemia</span></h2>
<p class="First"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">Methemoglobinemia</span> has been reported in patients receiving other organic nitrates, and it probably could also
									occur as a side effect of isosorbide mononitrate. Certainly nitrate ions liberated during metabolism of isosorbide 
									mononitrate can oxidize hemoglobin into methemoglobin. Even in patients totally without cytochrome b<span class="Sub">5</span> reductase activity, however, and even assuming that the nitrate moiety of isosorbide mononitrate 
									is quantitatively applied to oxidation of hemoglobin, about 2 mg/kg of isosorbide mononitrate should be required 
									before any of these patients manifests clinically significant (â‰¥10%) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">methemoglobinemia</span>. In patients with 
									normal reductase function, significant production of methemoglobin should require even larger doses of 
									isosorbide mononitrate. In one study in which 36 patients received 2 to 4 weeks of continuous nitroglycerin therapy
									at 3.1 to 4.4 mg/hr (equivalent, in total administered dose of nitrate ions, to 7.8 to 11.1 mg of isosorbide 
									mononitrate per hour), the average methemoglobin level measured was 0.2%; this was comparable to that 
									observed in parallel patients who received placebo. Notwithstanding these observations, there are case reports of 
									significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">methemoglobinemia</span> in association with moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> of organic nitrates. None of the affected 
									patients had been thought to be unusually susceptible.</p>
<p>Methemoglobin levels are available from most clinical laboratories. The diagnosis should be suspected in 
									patients who exhibit signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span> and adequate arterial 
									pO<span class="Sub">2</span>. Classically, methemoglobinemic blood is described as chocolate brown, without color change 
									on exposure to air. When <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">methemoglobinemia</span> is diagnosed, the treatment of choice is methylene blue, 1 to 2 
									mg/kg intravenously.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (SEE INDICATIONS AND USAGE)</h1>
<p class="First">The recommended regimen of Ismo tablets is 20 mg (one tablet) twice daily, with the two doses given 7 hours apart. For most
							patients, this can be accomplished by taking the first dose on awakening and the second dose 7 hours later. Dosage adjustments
							are not necessary for elderly patients or patients with altered renal or hepatic function. As noted above 
							(<span class="Bold"><a href="#CLINPHARM">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span>), multiple studies
							of organic nitrates have shown that maintenance of continuous 24-hour plasma levels results in refractory tolerance. The dosing 
							regimen for Ismo tablets provides a daily nitrate-free interval to avoid the development of this tolerance.</p>
<p>As also noted under <span class="Bold"><a href="#CLINPHARM">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span>, 
							well-controlled studies have shown that tolerance to Ismo tablets is avoided when using the twice-daily regimen in which the two 
							doses are given 7 hours apart. This regimen has been shown to have antianginal efficacy beginning 1 hour after the first dose 
							and lasting at least 5 hours after the second dose. The duration (if any) of antianginal activity beyond 12 hours has not been 
							studied; large controlled studies with other nitrates suggest that no dosing regimen should be expected to provide more than 
							about 12 hours of continuous antianginal efficacy per day.</p>
<p>In clinical trials, Ismo tablets have been administered in a variety of regimens. Single doses less than 20 mg have not been 
							adequately studied, while single doses greater than 20 mg have demonstrated no greater efficacy than doses of 20 mg.</p>
