<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<br><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Intramuscular Administration</span><br>Amikacin is rapidly absorbed after intramuscular administration. In normal adult volunteers, average peak serum concentrations of about 12, 16, and 21 mcg/mL are obtained 1 hour after intramuscular administration of 250 mg (3.7 mg/kg), 375 mg (5 mg/kg), 500 mg (7.5 mg/kg), single doses, respectively. At 10 hours, serum levels are about 0.3 mcg/mL, 1.2 mcg/mL, and 2.1 mcg/mL, respectively.<br>Tolerance studies in normal volunteers reveal that amikacin is well tolerated locally following repeated intramuscular dosing, and when given at maximally recommended doses, no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4236623" conceptname="Ototoxicity">ototoxicity</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126119" conceptname="Toxic nephropathy">nephrotoxicity</span> has been reported. There is no evidence of drug accumulation with repeated dosing for 10 days when administered according to recommended doses.<br>With normal renal function, about 91.9% of an intramuscular dose is excreted unchanged in the urine in the first 8 hours, and 98.2% within 24 hours. Mean urine concentrations for 6 hours are 563 mcg/mL following a 250 mg dose, 697 mcg/mL following a 375 mg dose, and 832 mcg/mL following a 500 mg dose.<br>Preliminary intramuscular studies in newborns of different weights (less than 1.5 kg, 1.5 to 2 kg, over 2 kg) at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg revealed that, like other aminoglycosides, serum half-life values were correlated inversely with post-natal age and renal clearances of amikacin. The volume of distribution indicates that amikacin, like other aminoglycosides, remains primarily in the extracellular fluid space of neonates. Repeated dosing every 12 hours in all the above groups did not demonstrate accumulation after 5 days.<br><br><span class="Bold">Intravenous Administration</span><br>Single doses of 500 mg (7.5 mg/kg) administered to normal adults as an infusion over a period of 30 minutes produced a mean peak serum concentration of 38 mcg/mL at the end of the infusion, and levels of 24 mcg/mL, 18 mcg/mL, and 0.75 mcg/mL at 30 minutes, 1 hour, and 10 hours post-infusion, respectively. Eighty-four percent of the administered dose was excreted in the urine in 9 hours and about 94% within 24 hours.<br>Repeat infusions of 7.5 mg/kg every 12 hours in normal adults were well tolerated and caused no drug accumulation.<br><br><span class="Bold">General</span><br>Pharmacokinetic studies in normal adult subjects reveal the mean serum half-life to be slightly over 2 hours with a mean total apparent volume of distribution of 24 liters (28% of the body weight). By the ultrafiltration technique, reports of serum protein binding range from 0 to 11%. The mean serum clearance rate is about 100 mL/min and the renal clearance rate is 94 mL/min in subjects with normal renal function.<br>Amikacin is excreted primarily by glomerular filtration. Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span> or diminished glomerular filtration pressure excrete the drug much more slowly (effectively prolonging the serum half-life). Therefore, renal function should be monitored carefully and dosage adjusted accordingly (see suggested dosage schedule under <a href="#Section_10">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).<br>Following administration at the recommended dose, therapeutic levels are found in bone, heart, gallbladder, and lung tissue in addition to significant concentrations in urine, bile, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4102774" conceptname="Productive cough">sputum</span>, bronchial secretions, interstitial, pleural, and synovial fluids.<br>Spinal fluid levels in normal infants are approximately 10 to 20% of the serum concentrations and may reach 50% when the meninges are inflamed. Amikacin has been demonstrated to cross the placental barrier and yield significant concentrations in amniotic fluid. The peak fetal serum concentration is about 16% of the peak maternal serum concentration and maternal and fetal serum half-life values are about 2 and 3.7 hours, respectively.<br><br><span class="Bold">Microbiology</span></p>

One such procedure* has been recommended for use with discs to test susceptibility to amikacin. Interpretation involves correlation of the diameters obtained in the disc test with MIC values for amikacin. When the causative organism is tested by the Kirby-Bauer method of disc susceptibility, a 30 mcg amikacin disc should give a zone of 17 mm or greater to indicate susceptibility. Zone sizes of 14 mm or less indicate resistance. Zone sizes of 15 to 16 mm indicate intermediate susceptibility. With this procedure, a report from the laboratory of â€œsusceptibleâ€? indicates that the infecting organism is likely to respond to therapy. A report of â€œresistantâ€? indicates that the infecting organism is not likely to respond to therapy. A report of â€œintermediate susceptibilityâ€? suggests that the organism would be susceptible if the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> is confined to tissues and fluids (e.g., urine) in which high antibiotic levels are attained.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<br><p class="First">The patientâ€™s pretreatment body weight should be obtained for calculation of correct dosage. Amikacin Sulfate Injection USP may be given intramuscularly or intravenously.<br>The status of renal function should be estimated by measurement of the serum creatinine concentration or calculation of the endogenous creatinine clearance rate. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is much less reliable for this purpose. Reassessment of renal function should be made periodically during therapy.<br>Whenever possible, amikacin concentrations in serum should be measured to assure adequate but not excessive levels. It is desirable to measure both peak and trough serum concentrations intermittently during therapy. Peak concentrations (30 to 90 minutes after injection) above 35 micrograms per mL and trough concentrations (just prior to the next dose) above 10 micrograms per mL should be avoided. Dosage should be adjusted as indicated.<br><br><span class="Bold">Intramuscular Administration for Patients with Normal Renal Function</span><br>The recommended dosage for adults, children and older infants (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_0">WARNINGS  box</a></span>) with normal renal function is 15 mg/kg/day divided into 2 or 3 equal doses administered at equally-divided intervals, i.e., 7.5 mg/kg q12h or 5 mg/kg q8h. Treatment of patients in the heavier weight classes should not exceed 1.5 gram/day.<br>When amikacin is indicated in newborns (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Section_0">WARNINGS  box</a></span>), it is recommended that a loading dose of 10 mg/kg be administered initially to be followed with 7.5 mg/kg every 12 hours.<br>The useful duration of treatment is 7 to 10 days. It is desirable to limit the duration of treatment to short term whenever feasible.<br>The total daily dose by all routes of administration should not exceed 15 mg/kg/day. In difficult and complicated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> where treatment beyond 10 days is considered, the use of amikacin should be reevaluated. If continued, amikacin serum levels, and renal, auditory, and vestibular functions should be monitored. At the recommended dosage level, uncomplicated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> due to amikacin-sensitive organisms should respond in 24 to 48 hours. If definite clinical response does not occur within 3 to 5 days, therapy should be stopped and the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the invading organism should be rechecked. Failure of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> to respond may be due to resistance of the organism or to the presence of septic foci requiring surgical drainage.<br>When amikacin is indicated in uncomplicated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="81902" conceptname="Urinary tract infectious disease">urinary tract infections</span>, a dose of 250 mg twice daily may be used.</p>
