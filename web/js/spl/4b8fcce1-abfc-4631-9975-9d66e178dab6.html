<a href="http://"></a>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pharmacodynamics<p class="First">The antidepressant, antiobsessive compulsive, and antibulimic 
actions of fluoxetine are presumed to be linked to its inhibition of CNS 
neuronal uptake of serotonin. Studies at clinically relevant doses in man have 
demonstrated that fluoxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human 
platelets. Studies in animals also suggest that fluoxetine is a much more potent 
uptake inhibitor of serotonin than of norepinephrine.</p>
<p>Antagonism of muscarinic, histaminergic, and Î±<span class="Sub">1</span>â€“adrenergic receptors has been hypothesized to be associated 
with various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular effects of classical 
tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) drugs. Fluoxetine binds to these and other 
membrane receptors from brain tissue much less potently inÂ vitro than do the 
tricyclic drugs.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and 
Excretion<a href="http://"></a><p><span class="Bold">Systemic bioavailability</span> â€” In man, 
following a single oral 40â€“mgÂ dose, peak plasma concentrations of fluoxetine 
from 15 to 55Â ng/mL are observed after 6 to 8Â hours.</p>
<p>The Pulvule, oral solution, and ProzacÂ Weekly capsule dosage forms of 
fluoxetine are bioequivalent. Food does not appear to affect the systemic 
bioavailability of fluoxetine, although it may delay its absorption by 1 to 2 
hours, which is probably not clinically significant. Thus, fluoxetine may be 
administered with or without food. Prozac Weekly capsules, a delayedâ€“release 
formulation, contain entericâ€“coated pellets that resist dissolution until 
reaching a segment of the gastrointestinal tract where the pH exceeds 5.5. The 
enteric coating delays the onset of absorption of fluoxetine 1 to 2 hours 
relative to the immediateâ€“release formulations.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p><span class="Bold">Protein binding</span> â€” Over the concentration 
range from 200 to 1000Â ng/mL, approximately 94.5% of fluoxetine is bound 
inÂ vitro to human serum proteins, including albumin and Î±<span class="Sub">1</span>â€“glycoprotein. The interaction between fluoxetine and other 
highly proteinâ€“bound drugs has not been fully evaluated, but may be important 
(<span class="Italics">see</span><a href="#section-9"> PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p><span class="Bold">Enantiomers</span> â€” Fluoxetine is a racemic 
mixture (50/50) of <span class="Italics">R</span>â€“fluoxetine and <span class="Italics">S</span>â€“fluoxetine enantiomers. In animal models, both 
enantiomers are specific and potent serotonin uptake inhibitors with essentially 
equivalent pharmacologic activity. The <span class="Italics">S</span>â€“fluoxetine 
enantiomer is eliminated more slowly and is the predominant enantiomer present 
in plasma at steady state.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span> â€” Fluoxetine is extensively 
metabolized in the liver to norfluoxetine and a number of other unidentified 
metabolites. The only identified active metabolite, norfluoxetine, is formed by 
demethylation of fluoxetine. In animal models, <span class="Italics">S</span>â€“norfluoxetine is a potent and selective inhibitor of 
serotonin uptake and has activity essentially equivalent to <span class="Italics">R</span>â€“ or <span class="Italics">S</span>â€“fluoxetine. <span class="Italics">R</span>â€“norfluoxetine is significantly less potent than the 
parent drug in the inhibition of serotonin uptake. The primary route of 
elimination appears to be hepatic metabolism to inactive metabolites excreted by 
the kidney.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p><span class="Bold">Clinical issues related to 
metabolism/elimination</span> â€” The complexity of the metabolism of fluoxetine 
has several consequences that may potentially affect fluoxetineâ€™s clinical 
use.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Variability in metabolism</span> â€” A subset (about 7%) 
of the population has reduced activity of the drug metabolizing enzyme 
cytochrome P450Â 2D6 (CYP2D6). Such individuals are referred to as â€œpoor 
metabolizersâ€? of drugs such as debrisoquin, dextromethorphan, and the TCAs. In a 
study involving labeled and unlabeled enantiomers administered as a racemate, 
these individuals metabolized <span class="Italics">S</span>â€“fluoxetine at a 
slower rate and thus achieved higher concentrations of <span class="Italics">S</span>â€“fluoxetine. Consequently, concentrations of <span class="Italics">S</span>â€“norfluoxetine at steady state were lower. The metabolism 
of <span class="Italics">R</span>â€“fluoxetine in these poor metabolizers appears 
normal. When compared with normal metabolizers, the total sum at steady state of 
the plasma concentrations of the 4 active enantiomers was not significantly 
greater among poor metabolizers. Thus, the net pharmacodynamic activities were 
essentially the same. Alternative, nonsaturable pathways (nonâ€“2D6) also 
contribute to the metabolism of fluoxetine. This explains how fluoxetine 
achieves a steadyâ€“state concentration rather than increasing without limit.</p>
<p>Because fluoxetineâ€™s metabolism, like that of a number of other compounds 
including TCAs and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), 
involves the CYP2D6 system, concomitant therapy with drugs also metabolized by 
this enzyme system (such as the TCAs) may lead to drug interactions (<span class="Italics">see</span><a href="#section-9.4"> Drug Interactions </a><span class="Italics">under</span> PRECAUTIONS).</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Accumulation and slow elimination</span> â€” The 
relatively slow elimination of fluoxetine (elimination halfâ€“life of 1 to 3 days 
after acute administration and 4 to 6 days after chronic administration) and its 
active metabolite, norfluoxetine (elimination halfâ€“life of 4 to 16 days after 
acute and chronic administration), leads to significant accumulation of these 
active species in chronic use and delayed attainment of steady state, even when 
a fixed dose is used. After 30 days of dosing at 40Â mg/day, plasma 
concentrations of fluoxetine in the range of 91 to 302Â ng/mL and norfluoxetine 
in the range of 72 to 258Â ng/mL have been observed. Plasma concentrations of 
fluoxetine were higher than those predicted by singleâ€“dose studies, because 
fluoxetineâ€™s metabolism is not proportional to dose. Norfluoxetine, however, 
appears to have linear pharmacokinetics. Its mean terminal halfâ€“life after a 
single dose was 8.6 days and after multiple dosing was 9.3 days. Steadyâ€“state 
levels after prolonged dosing are similar to levels seen at 4 to 5 weeks.</p>
<p>The long elimination halfâ€“lives of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine assure that, 
even when dosing is stopped, active drug substance will persist in the body for 
weeks (primarily depending on individual patient characteristics, previous 
dosing regimen, and length of previous therapy at discontinuation). This is of 
potential consequence when drug discontinuation is required or when drugs are 
prescribed that might interact with fluoxetine and norfluoxetine following the 
discontinuation of Prozac.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p><span class="Bold">Weekly dosing</span> â€” Administration of Prozac 
Weekly once weekly results in increased fluctuation between peak and trough 
concentrations of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine compared with onceâ€“daily dosing 
[for fluoxetine: 24% (daily) to 164% (weekly) and for norfluoxetine: 17% (daily) 
to 43% (weekly)]. Plasma concentrations may not necessarily be predictive of 
clinical response. Peak concentrations from onceâ€“weekly doses of Prozac Weekly 
capsules of fluoxetine are in the range of the average concentration for 20â€“mg 
onceâ€“daily dosing. Average trough concentrations are 76% lower for fluoxetine 
and 47% lower for norfluoxetine than the concentrations maintained by 20â€“mg 
onceâ€“daily dosing. Average steadyâ€“state concentrations of either onceâ€“daily or 
onceâ€“weekly dosing are in relative proportion to the total dose administered. 
Average steadyâ€“state fluoxetine concentrations are approximately 50% lower 
following the onceâ€“weekly regimen compared with the onceâ€“daily regimen.</p>
<p>C<span class="Sub">max</span> for fluoxetine following the 90â€“mg dose was 
approximately 1.7â€“fold higher than the C<span class="Sub">max</span> value for the 
established 20â€“mg onceâ€“daily regimen following transition the next day to the 
onceâ€“weekly regimen. In contrast, when the first 90â€“mg onceâ€“weekly dose and the 
last 20â€“mg onceâ€“daily dose were separated by 1 week, C<span class="Sub">max</span> 
values were similar. Also, there was a transient increase in the average 
steadyâ€“state concentrations of fluoxetine observed following transition the next 
day to the onceâ€“weekly regimen. From a pharmacokinetic perspective, it may be 
better to separate the first 90â€“mg weekly dose and the last 20â€“mg onceâ€“daily 
dose by 1 week (<span class="Italics">see</span><a href="#section-13"> DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p><span class="Bold">Liver disease</span> â€” As might be predicted 
from its primary site of metabolism, liver impairment can affect the elimination 
of fluoxetine. The elimination halfâ€“life of fluoxetine was prolonged in a study 
of cirrhotic patients, with a mean of 7.6 days compared with the range of 2 to 3 
days seen in subjects without liver disease; norfluoxetine elimination was also 
delayed, with a mean duration of 12 days for cirrhotic patients compared with 
the range of 7 to 9 days in normal subjects. This suggests that the use of 
fluoxetine in patients with liver disease must be approached with caution. If 
fluoxetine is administered to patients with liver disease, a lower or less 
frequent dose should be used (<span class="Italics">see</span><a href="#section-9"> PRECAUTIONS </a><span class="Italics">and</span><a href="#section-13"> DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">Renal disease</span></span> â€” In depressed patients on 
dialysis (N=12), fluoxetine administered as 20Â mg once daily for 2 months 
produced steadyâ€“state fluoxetine and norfluoxetine plasma concentrations 
comparable with those seen in patients with normal renal function. While the 
possibility exists that renally excreted metabolites of fluoxetine may 
accumulate to higher levels in patients with severe renal dysfunction, use of a 
lower or less frequent dose is not routinely necessary in renally impaired 
patients (<span class="Italics">see</span><a href="#section-9.1.8"> Use in 
Patients with Concomitant Illness </a><span class="Italics">under</span> 
PRECAUTIONS <span class="Italics">and</span><a href="#section-13"> DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Age<p><span class="Underline">Geriatric pharmacokinetics</span> â€” The 
disposition of single doses of fluoxetine in healthy elderly subjects (&gt;65 
years of age) did not differ significantly from that in younger normal subjects. 
However, given the long halfâ€“life and nonlinear disposition of the drug, a 
singleâ€“dose study is not adequate to rule out the possibility of altered 
pharmacokinetics in the elderly, particularly if they have systemic illness or 
are receiving multiple drugs for concomitant diseases. The effects of age upon 
the metabolism of fluoxetine have been investigated in 260 elderly but otherwise 
healthy depressed patients (â‰¥60 years of age) who received 20Â mg fluoxetine for 
6 weeks. Combined fluoxetine plus norfluoxetine plasma concentrations were 
209.3Â Â±Â 85.7Â ng/mL at the end of 6 weeks. No unusual ageâ€“associated pattern of 
adverse events was observed in those elderly patients.</p>

Patients with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may 
experience worsening of their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and/or the emergence of suicidal 
ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or 
not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until 
significant remission occurs. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> is a known risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and certain 
other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest 
predictors of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>. There has been a longâ€“standing concern, however, that 
antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and the 
emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of 
treatment. Pooled analyses of shortâ€“term placeboâ€“controlled trials of 
antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the 
risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, 
and young adults (ages 18â€“24) with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD) and other 
psychiatric disorders. Shortâ€“term studies did not show an increase in the risk 
of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; 
there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 
and older.</p>
<p>The pooled analyses of placeboâ€“controlled trials in children and adolescents 
with MDD, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440374" conceptname="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">obsessive compulsive disorder</span> (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders 
included a total of 24 shortâ€“term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 
patients. The pooled analyses of placeboâ€“controlled trials in adults with MDD or 
other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 shortâ€“term trials (median 
duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There 
was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency 
toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There 
were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different 
indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences 
(drugÂ versusÂ placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and 
across indications. These risk differences (drugâ€“placebo difference in the 
number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table </p>
<p>No <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> in 
the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion 
about drug effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>.</p>
<p>It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longerâ€“term use, i.e., 
beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from 
placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> that the use of 
antidepressants can delay the recurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">All patients being treated with antidepressants for any 
indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical 
worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the 
initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, 
either increases or decreases.</span></p>

patients being treated with antidepressants for major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> as 
well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a 
causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, 
there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging 
suicidality.</p>
<p>Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including 
possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> is 
persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms 
that might be precursors to worsening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> or suicidality, especially if 
these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patientâ€™s 
presenting symptoms.</p>
<p>If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be 
tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt 
discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms (<span class="Italics">see</span><a href="#section-9"> PRECAUTIONS </a><span class="Italics">and</span><a href="#section-13.6"> DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION,

<p><span class="Bold">Families and caregivers of patients being treated with 
antidepressants for major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> or other indications, both 
psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor 
patients for the emergence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, unusual changes in 
behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of 
suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. 
Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and 
caregivers.</span> Prescriptions for Prozac should be written for the smallest 
quantity of capsules, or liquid consistent with good patient management, in 
order to reduce the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Prozac is approved in the pediatric population only 
for major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440374" conceptname="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">obsessive compulsive disorder</span>.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p><span class="Bold">Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder</span>Â â€” 
A major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive episode</span> may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. 
It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that 
treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the 
likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic episode</span> in patients at risk for 
bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a 
conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an 
antidepressant, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4191716" conceptname="Symptoms of depression">depressive symptoms</span> should be adequately screened 
to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should 
include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>, 
bipolar disorder, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>. It should be noted that Prozac is not approved 
for use in treating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436665" conceptname="Bipolar disorder">bipolar depression</span>.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">Rash</span> and Possibly Allergic Events</span> â€” In 
USÂ fluoxetine clinical trials as of MayÂ 8, 1995, 7% of 10,782 patients developed 
various types of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rashes</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="139900" conceptname="Urticaria">urticaria</span>.

withdrawn from treatment because of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> and/or systemic signs or symptoms 
associated with the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>. Clinical findings reported in association with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>

elevation. Most patients improved promptly with discontinuation of fluoxetine 
and/or adjunctive treatment with antihistamines or steroids, and all patients 
experiencing these events were reported to recover completely.</p>
<p>In premarketing clinical trials, 2 patients are known to have developed a 
serious cutaneous systemic illness. In neither patient was there an unequivocal 
diagnosis, but one was considered to have a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196431" conceptname="Hypersensitivity angiitis">leukocytoclastic vasculitis</span>, and the 
other, a severe desquamating syndrome that was considered variously to be a

suggestive of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432522" conceptname="Transfusion reaction due to serum protein reaction">serum sickness</span>.</p>
<p>Since the introduction of Prozac, systemic events, possibly related to 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137275" conceptname="Vasculitis">vasculitis</span> and including lupusâ€“like syndrome, have developed in patients with 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>. Although these events are rare, they may be serious, involving the lung, 
kidney, or liver. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Death</span> has been reported to occur in association with these

<p>Pulmonary events, including inflammatory processes of varying histopathology 
and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012171" conceptname="Fibrosis">fibrosis</span>, have been reported rarely. These events have occurred with 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">dyspnea</span> as the only preceding symptom.</p>
<p>Whether these systemic events and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> have a common underlying cause or are 
due to different etiologies or pathogenic processes is not known. Furthermore, a

Upon the appearance of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> or of other possibly allergic phenomena for which an 
alternative etiology cannot be identified, Prozac should be discontinued.</p>

<p>The concomitant use of Prozac with MAOIs intended to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> is

CONTRAINDICATIONS </a><span class="Italics">and</span><a href="#section-9.4.12"> 
Drug Interactions </a><span class="Italics">under</span> PRECAUTIONS).</p>
<p>If concomitant treatment Prozac with a 5â€“hydroxytryptamine receptor agonist 
(triptan) is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is 
advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases (<span class="Italics">see</span><a href="#section-9.4.13"> Drug Interactions </a><span class="Italics">under</span> PRECAUTIONS).</p>
<p>The concomitant use of Prozac with serotonin precursors (such as tryptophan)

<a href="http://"></a><p><span class="Bold">Potential Interaction with Thioridazine</span> â€” 
In a study of 19 healthy male subjects, which included 6 slow and 13 rapid 
hydroxylators of debrisoquin, a single 25â€“mg oral dose of thioridazine produced 
a 2.4â€“fold higher C<span class="Sub">max</span> and a 4.5â€“fold higher AUC for 
thioridazine in the slow hydroxylators compared with the rapid hydroxylators. 
The rate of debrisoquin hydroxylation is felt to depend on the level of CYP2D6 
isozyme activity. Thus, this study suggests that drugs which inhibit CYP2D6, 
such as certain SSRIs, including fluoxetine, will produce elevated plasma levels 
of thioridazine (<span class="Italics">see</span><a href="#section-9"> 
PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>
<p>Thioridazine administration produces a doseâ€“related prolongation of the

<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316135" conceptname="Atrioventricular block">heart block</span> were observed. The mean heart rate was reduced by approximately 
3Â beats/min.</p>
<p>In subjects with cirrhosis of the liver, the clearances of fluoxetine and its 
active metabolite, norfluoxetine, were decreased, thus increasing the 
elimination halfâ€“lives of these substances. A lower or less frequent dose should 
be used in patients with cirrhosis.</p>
<p>Studies in depressed patients on dialysis did not reveal excessive 
accumulation of fluoxetine or norfluoxetine in plasma (<span class="Italics">see</span><a href="#section-4.2.8"> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">Renal disease</span> </a><span class="Italics">under</span> CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

<a href="http://"></a><p><span class="Underline">Drugs metabolized by CYP2D6</span> â€” 
Fluoxetine inhibits the activity of CYP2D6, and may make individuals with normal 
CYP2D6 metabolic activity resemble a poor metabolizer. Coadministration of 
fluoxetine with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6, including certain 
antidepressants (e.g., TCAs), antipsychotics (e.g., phenothiazines and most 
atypicals), and antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and others) 
should be approached with caution. Therapy with medications that are 
predominantly metabolized by the CYP2D6 system and that have a relatively narrow 
therapeutic index (see list below) should be initiated at the low end of the 
dose range if a patient is receiving fluoxetine concurrently or has taken it in 
the previous 5 weeks. Thus, his/her dosing requirements resemble those of poor 
metabolizers. If fluoxetine is added to the treatment regimen of a patient 
already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need for decreased dose of 
the original medication should be considered. Drugs with a narrow therapeutic 
index represent the greatest concern (e.g., flecainide, propafenone, 
vinblastine, and TCAs). Due to the risk of serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span> and 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4132309" conceptname="Sudden death">sudden death</span> potentially associated with elevated plasma levels of thioridazine, 
thioridazine should not be administered with fluoxetine or within a minimum of 
5Â weeks after fluoxetine has been discontinued (<span class="Italics">see</span><a href="#section-7"> CONTRAINDICATIONS </a><span class="Italics">and</span><a href="#section-8"> WARNINGS</a>).</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p><span class="Underline">Drugs metabolized by CYP3A4</span> â€” In an 
inÂ vivo interaction study involving coadministration of fluoxetine with single 
doses of terfenadine (a CYP3A4 substrate), no increase in plasma terfenadine 
concentrations occurred with concomitant fluoxetine. In addition, inÂ vitro 
studies have shown ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity, to be at 
least 100 times more potent than fluoxetine or norfluoxetine as an inhibitor of 
the metabolism of several substrates for this enzyme, including astemizole, 
cisapride, and midazolam. These data indicate that fluoxetineâ€™s extent of 
inhibition of CYP3A4 activity is not likely to be of clinical 
significance.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p><span class="Underline">CNS active drugs</span> â€” The risk of using 
Prozac in combination with other CNS active drugs has not been systematically 
evaluated. Nonetheless, caution is advised if the concomitant administration of 
Prozac and such drugs is required. In evaluating individual cases, consideration 
should be given to using lower initial doses of the concomitantly administered 
drugs, using conservative titration schedules, and monitoring of clinical status

interaction or QT<span class="Sub">c</span> prolongation. While a specific study 
with pimozide and fluoxetine has not been conducted, the potential for drug 
interactions or QT<span class="Sub">c</span> prolongation warrants restricting the 
concurrent use of pimozide and Prozac. Concomitant use of Prozac and pimozide is

women whose infants were born with PPHN and 836 women whose infants were born 
healthy, the risk for developing PPHN was approximately sixâ€“fold higher for 
infants exposed to SSRIs after the 20th week of gestation compared to infants 
who had not been exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. There is currently 
no corroborative evidence regarding the risk for PPHN following exposure to 
SSRIs in pregnancy; this is the first study that has investigated the potential 
risk. The study did not include enough cases with exposure to individual SSRIs 
to determine if all SSRIs posed similar levels of PPHN risk.</p>
<p>When treating a pregnant woman with Prozac during the third trimester, the 
physician should carefully consider both the potential risks and benefits of 
treatment (<span class="Italics">see</span><a href="#section-13"> DOSAGEÂ AND 
ADMINISTRATION</a>). Physicians should note that in a prospective longitudinal 
study of 201 women with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4114950" conceptname="Endogenous depression">major depression</span> who were euthymic at the

women who continued antidepressant medication.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Labor and Delivery<p>The effect of Prozac on labor and delivery in humans is unknown. 
However, because fluoxetine crosses the placenta and because of the possibility 
that fluoxetine may have adverse effects on the newborn, fluoxetine should be 
used during labor and delivery only if the potential benefit justifies the 
potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Nursing Mothers<p>Because Prozac is excreted in human milk, nursing while on Prozac 
is not recommended. In one breastâ€“milk sample, the concentration of fluoxetine 
plus norfluoxetine was 70.4Â ng/mL. The concentration in the motherâ€™s plasma was 
295.0Â ng/mL. No adverse effects on the infant were reported. In another case, an

with various diagnoses in US clinical trials as of MayÂ 8, 1995. In addition, 
there have been 425 patients administered Prozac in panic clinical trials. 
Adverse events were recorded by clinical investigators using descriptive 
terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a 
meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events 
without first grouping similar types of events into a limited (i.e., reduced) 
number of standardized event categories.</p>
<p>In the tables and tabulations that follow, COSTART Dictionary terminology has 
been used to classify reported adverse events. The stated frequencies represent 
the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a 
treatmentâ€“emergent adverse event of the type listed. An event was considered 
treatmentâ€“emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving 
therapy following baseline evaluation. It is important to emphasize that events 
reported during therapy were not necessarily caused by it.</p>
<p>The prescriber should be aware that the figures in the tables and tabulations 
cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual 
medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from 
those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies 
cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations 
involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, 
however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the 
relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side effect incidence 
rate in the population studied.</p>

<p>Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac 
rhythm and vital signs. General supportive and symptomatic measures are also 
recommended. Induction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> is not recommended. Gastric lavage with a 
largeâ€“bore orogastric tube with appropriate airway protection, if needed, may be 
indicated if performed soon after ingestion, or in symptomatic patients.</p>
<p>Activated charcoal should be administered. Due to the large volume of 
distribution of this drug, forced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span>, dialysis, hemoperfusion, and

<p>A specific caution involves patients who are taking or have recently taken 
fluoxetine and might ingest excessive quantities of a TCA. In such a case, 
accumulation of the parent tricyclic and/or an active metabolite may increase 
the possibility of clinically significant sequelae and extend the time needed 
for close medical observation (<span class="Italics">see</span><a href="#section-9.4.11"> Other drugs effective in the treatment of major

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Maintenance/Continuation/Extended Treatment<p>It is generally agreed that acute episodes of major depressive

patients were administered fixed daily doses of 20, 40, or 60Â mg of fluoxetine 
or placebo (<span class="Italics">see</span><a href="#section-5"> CLINICAL 
TRIALS</a>). In 1 of these studies, no doseâ€“response relationship for 
effectiveness was demonstrated. Consequently, a dose of 20Â mg/day, administered 
in the morning, is recommended as the initial dose. Since there was a suggestion 
of a possible doseâ€“response relationship for effectiveness in the second study, 
a dose increase may be considered after several weeks if insufficient clinical 
improvement is observed. The full therapeutic effect may be delayed until 5 
weeks of treatment or longer.</p>
<p>Doses above 20Â mg/day may be administered on a onceâ€“aâ€“day (i.e., morning) or 
BID schedule (i.e., morning and noon). A dose range of 20 to 60Â mg/day is 
recommended; however, doses of up to 80Â mg/day have been well tolerated in open 
studies of OCD. The maximum fluoxetine dose should not exceed 80Â mg/day.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Pediatric (children and adolescents)</span> â€” In the 
controlled clinical trial of fluoxetine supporting its effectiveness in the 
treatment of OCD, patients were administered fluoxetine doses in the range of 10 
to 60Â mg/day (<span class="Italics">see</span><a href="#section-5"> CLINICAL 
TRIALS</a>).</p>
<p>In adolescents and higher weight children, treatment should be initiated with 
a dose of 10Â mg/day. After 2 weeks, the dose should be increased to 20Â mg/day. 
Additional dose increases may be considered after several more weeks if 
insufficient clinical improvement is observed. A dose range of 20 to 60Â mg/day 
is recommended.</p>
<p>In lower weight children, treatment should be initiated with a dose of

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Maintenance/Continuation Treatment<p>While there are no systematic studies that answer the question of 
how long to continue Prozac, OCD is a chronic condition and it is reasonable to 
consider continuation for a responding patient. Although the efficacy of Prozac 
after 13 weeks has not been documented in controlled trials, adult patients have 
been continued in therapy under doubleâ€“blind conditions for up to an additional 
6 months without loss of benefit. However, dosage adjustments should be made to 
maintain the patient on the lowest effective dosage, and patients should be 
periodically reassessed to determine the need for treatment.</p>

<a href="http://"></a><p><span class="Underline">Drugs metabolized by CYP2D6</span> â€” 
Fluoxetine inhibits the activity of CYP2D6, and may make individuals with normal 
CYP2D6 metabolic activity resemble a poor metabolizer. Coadministration of 
fluoxetine with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6, including certain 
antidepressants (e.g., TCAs), antipsychotics (e.g., phenothiazines and most 
atypicals), and antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and others) 
should be approached with caution. Therapy with medications that are 
predominantly metabolized by the CYP2D6 system and that have a relatively narrow 
therapeutic index (see list below) should be initiated at the low end of the 
dose range if a patient is receiving fluoxetine concurrently or has taken it in

metabolizers. If fluoxetine is added to the treatment regimen of a patient 
already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need for decreased dose of 
the original medication should be considered. Drugs with a narrow therapeutic 
index represent the greatest concern (e.g., flecainide, propafenone, 
vinblastine, and TCAs). Due to the risk of serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span> and

5Â weeks after fluoxetine has been discontinued (<span class="Italics">see</span><a href="#section-7"> CONTRAINDICATIONS </a><span class="Italics">and</span><a href="#section-8"> WARNINGS</a>).</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p><span class="Underline">Drugs metabolized by CYP3A4</span> â€” In an 
inÂ vivo interaction study involving coadministration of fluoxetine with single 
doses of terfenadine (a CYP3A4 substrate), no increase in plasma terfenadine 
concentrations occurred with concomitant fluoxetine. In addition, inÂ vitro 
studies have shown ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity, to be at 
least 100 times more potent than fluoxetine or norfluoxetine as an inhibitor of 
the metabolism of several substrates for this enzyme, including astemizole, 
cisapride, and midazolam. These data indicate that fluoxetineâ€™s extent of 
inhibition of CYP3A4 activity is not likely to be of clinical 
significance.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p><span class="Underline">CNS active drugs</span> â€” The risk of using 
Prozac in combination with other CNS active drugs has not been systematically 
evaluated. Nonetheless, caution is advised if the concomitant administration of

bound to plasma protein, the administration of fluoxetine to a patient taking 
another drug that is tightly bound to protein (e.g., Coumadin, digitoxin) may 
cause a shift in plasma concentrations potentially resulting in an adverse 
effect. Conversely, adverse effects may result from displacement of

persistent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322024" conceptname="Pulmonary hypertension">pulmonary hypertension</span> of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1â€“2 per 
1000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial 
neonatal morbidity and mortality. In a retrospective caseâ€“control study of 377 
women whose infants were born with PPHN and 836 women whose infants were born 
healthy, the risk for developing PPHN was approximately sixâ€“fold higher for 
infants exposed to SSRIs after the 20th week of gestation compared to infants 
who had not been exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. There is currently 
no corroborative evidence regarding the risk for PPHN following exposure to 
SSRIs in pregnancy; this is the first study that has investigated the potential 
risk. The study did not include enough cases with exposure to individual SSRIs 
to determine if all SSRIs posed similar levels of PPHN risk.</p>
<p>When treating a pregnant woman with Prozac during the third trimester, the 
physician should carefully consider both the potential risks and benefits of 
treatment (<span class="Italics">see</span><a href="#section-13"> DOSAGEÂ AND 
ADMINISTRATION</a>). Physicians should note that in a prospective longitudinal 
study of 201 women with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4114950" conceptname="Endogenous depression">major depression</span> who were euthymic at the

women who continued antidepressant medication.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Labor and Delivery<p>The effect of Prozac on labor and delivery in humans is unknown. 
However, because fluoxetine crosses the placenta and because of the possibility 
that fluoxetine may have adverse effects on the newborn, fluoxetine should be 
used during labor and delivery only if the potential benefit justifies the 
potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Nursing Mothers<p>Because Prozac is excreted in human milk, nursing while on Prozac 
is not recommended. In one breastâ€“milk sample, the concentration of fluoxetine 
plus norfluoxetine was 70.4Â ng/mL. The concentration in the motherâ€™s plasma was 
295.0Â ng/mL. No adverse effects on the infant were reported. In another case, an
