<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Alendronate sodium is a bisphosphonate that acts as a specific inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Bisphosphonates are synthetic analogs of pyrophosphate that bind to the hydroxyapatite found in bone. </p>
<p>Alendronate sodium is chemically described as (4-amino-1-hydroxybutylidene) bisphosphonic acid monosodium salt trihydrate. </p>
<p>The structural formula is: </p>

<h2>Mechanism of Action </h2>
<p class="First">Animal studies have indicated the following mode of action. At the cellular level, alendronate shows preferential localization to sites of bone resorption, specifically under osteoclasts. The osteoclasts adhere normally to the bone surface but lack the ruffled border that is indicative of active resorption. Alendronate does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment or attachment, but it does inhibit osteoclast activity. Studies in mice on the localization of radioactive [<span class="Sup">3</span>H]alendronate in bone showed about 10 fold higher uptake on osteoclast surfaces than on osteoblast surfaces. Bones examined 6 and 49 days after [<span class="Sup">3</span>H]alendronate administration in rats and mice, respectively, showed that normal bone was formed on top of the alendronate, which was incorporated inside the matrix. While incorporated in bone matrix, alendronate is not pharmacologically active. Thus, alendronate must be continuously administered to suppress osteoclasts on newly formed resorption surfaces. Histomorphometry in baboons and rats showed that alendronate treatment reduces bone turnover (i.e., the number of sites at which bone is remodeled). In addition, bone formation exceeds bone resorption at these remodeling sites, leading to progressive gains in bone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span>. </p>

<h3>Absorption </h3>
<p class="First">Relative to an intravenous (IV) reference dose, the mean oral bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses ranging from 5 to 70 mg when administered after an overnight fast and two hours before a standardized breakfast. Oral bioavailability of the 10 mg tablet in men (0.59%) was similar to that in women when administered after an overnight fast and 2 hours before breakfast. </p>
<p>Alendronate oral solution, 70 mg and alendronate sodium tablets, 70 mg are equally bioavailable.</p>
<p>A study examining the effect of timing of a meal on the bioavailability of alendronate was performed in 49 postmenopausal women. Bioavailability was decreased (by approximately 40%) when 10 mg alendronate was administered either 0.5 or 1 hour before a standardized breakfast, when compared to dosing 2 hours before eating. In studies of treatment and prevention of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span>, alendronate was effective when administered at least 30 minutes before breakfast. </p>
<p>Bioavailability was negligible whether alendronate was administered with or up to two hours after a standardized breakfast. Concomitant administration of alendronate with coffee or orange juice reduced bioavailability by approximately 60%. </p>

<h3>Distribution </h3>
<p class="First">Preclinical studies (in male rats) show that alendronate transiently distributes to soft tissues following 1 mg/kg IV administration but is then rapidly redistributed to bone or excreted in the urine. The mean steady-state volume of distribution, exclusive of bone, is at least 28 L in humans. Concentrations of drug in plasma following therapeutic oral doses are too low (less than 5 ng/mL) for analytical detection. Protein binding in human plasma is approximately 78%. </p>

<h3>Metabolism </h3>
<p class="First">There is no evidence that alendronate is metabolized in animals or humans. </p>

<h3>Excretion </h3>
<p class="First">Following a single IV dose of [<span class="Sup">14</span>C]alendronate, approximately 50% of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine within 72 hours and little or no radioactivity was recovered in the feces. Following a single 10 mg IV dose, the renal clearance of alendronate was 71 mL/min (64, 78; 90% confidence interval [CI]), and systemic clearance did not exceed 200 mL/min. Plasma concentrations fell by more than 95% within 6 hours following IV administration. The terminal half-life in humans is estimated to exceed 10 years, probably reflecting release of alendronate from the skeleton. Based on the above, it is estimated that after 10 years of oral treatment with alendronate sodium (10 mg daily) the amount of alendronate released daily from the skeleton is approximately 25% of that absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. </p>

<h4><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal insufficiency</span></h4>
<p class="First">Preclinical studies show that, in rats with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">kidney failure</span>, increasing amounts of drug are present in plasma, kidney, spleen, and tibia. In healthy controls, drug that is not deposited in bone is rapidly excreted in the urine.

Although no clinical information is available, it is likely that, as in animals, elimination of alendronate via the kidney will be reduced in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>. Therefore, somewhat greater accumulation of alendronate in bone might be expected in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>. </p>

<h3>Drug Interactions </h3>
<p class="First">(Also see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>, <span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span>.) </p>
<p>Intravenous ranitidine was shown to double the bioavailability of oral alendronate. The clinical significance of this increased bioavailability and whether similar increases will occur in patients given oral H<span class="Sub">2</span>-antagonists is unknown.</p>
<p>In healthy subjects, oral prednisone (20 mg three times daily for five days) did not produce a clinically meaningful change in the oral bioavailability of alendronate (a mean increase ranging from 20 to 44%).</p>
<p>Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations are likely to interfere with absorption of alendronate. </p>

<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that binds to bone hydroxyapatite and specifically inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells. Alendronate reduces bone resorption with no direct effect on bone formation, although the latter process is ultimately reduced because bone resorption and formation are coupled during bone turnover.</p>

<p>Daily oral doses of alendronate (5, 20, and 40 mg for six weeks) in postmenopausal women produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent inhibition of bone resorption, including decreases in urinary calcium and urinary markers of bone collagen degradation (such as deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen). These biochemical changes tended to return toward baseline values as early as 3 weeks following the discontinuation of therapy with alendronate and did not differ from placebo after 7 months. </p>
<p>Long-term treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> with alendronate sodium 10 mg/day (for up to five years) reduced urinary excretion of markers of bone resorption, deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen, by approximately 50% and 70%, respectively, to reach levels similar to those seen in healthy premenopausal women. Similar decreases were seen in patients in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> prevention studies who received alendronate sodium 5 mg/day. The decrease in the rate of bone resorption indicated by these markers was evident as early as one month and at three to six months reached a plateau that was maintained for the entire duration of treatment with alendronate sodium. In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> treatment studies alendronate sodium 10 mg/day decreased the markers of bone formation, osteocalcin and bone specific alkaline phosphatase by approximately 50%, and total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 25 to 30% to reach a plateau after 6 to 12 months. In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> prevention studies alendronate sodium 5 mg/day decreased osteocalcin and total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 40% and 15%, respectively. Similar reductions in the rate of bone turnover were observed in postmenopausal women during one-year studies with once weekly alendronate sodium 70 mg for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> and once weekly alendronate sodium 35 mg for the prevention of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span>. These data indicate that the rate of bone turnover reached a new steady-state, despite the progressive increase in the total amount of alendronate deposited within bone. </p>
<p>As a result of inhibition of bone resorption, asymptomatic reductions in serum calcium and phosphate concentrations were also observed following treatment with alendronate sodium. In the long-term studies, reductions from baseline in serum calcium (approximately 2%) and phosphate (approximately 4 to 6%) were evident the first month after the initiation of alendronate sodium 10 mg. No further decreases in serum calcium were observed for the five-year duration of treatment; however, serum phosphate returned toward prestudy levels during years three through five. Similar reductions were observed with alendronate sodium 5 mg/day. In one-year studies with once weekly alendronate sodium 35 and 70 mg, similar reductions were observed at 6 and 12 months. The reduction in serum phosphate may reflect not only the positive bone mineral balance due to alendronate sodium but also a decrease in renal phosphate reabsorption. </p>

<h3>Paget’s Disease of Bone </h3>
<p class="First">Paget’s disease of bone is a chronic, focal skeletal disorder characterized by greatly increased and disorderly bone remodeling. Excessive osteoclastic bone resorption is followed by osteoblastic new bone formation, leading to the replacement of the normal bone architecture by disorganized, enlarged, and weakened bone structure. </p>
<p>Clinical manifestations of Paget's disease range from no symptoms to severe morbidity due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129418" conceptname="Bone pain">bone pain</span>, bone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168498" conceptname="Deformity">deformity</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="73571" conceptname="Pathological fracture">pathological fractures</span>, and neurological and other complications. Serum alkaline phosphatase, the most frequently used biochemical index of disease activity, provides an objective measure of disease severity and response to therapy. </p>
<p>Alendronate sodium decreases the rate of bone resorption directly, which leads to an indirect decrease in bone formation. In clinical trials, alendronate sodium 40 mg once daily for six months produced significant decreases in serum alkaline phosphatase as well as in urinary markers of bone collagen degradation. As a result of the inhibition of bone resorption, alendronate sodium induced generally mild, transient, and asymptomatic decreases in serum calcium and phosphate. </p>

</div>
<p>At three years significant increases in BMD, relative both to baseline and placebo, were seen at each measurement site in each study in patients who received alendronate sodium 10 mg/day. Total body BMD also increased significantly in each study, suggesting that the increases in bone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> of the spine and hip did not occur at the expense of other skeletal sites. Increases in BMD were evident as early as three months and continued throughout the three years of treatment. (See figures below for lumbar spine results.) In the two-year extension of these studies, treatment of 147 patients with alendronate sodium 10 mg/day resulted in continued increases in BMD at the lumbar spine and trochanter (absolute additional increases between years 3 and 5: lumbar spine, 0.94%; trochanter, 0.88%). BMD at the femoral neck, forearm and total body were maintained. Alendronate sodium was similarly effective regardless of age, race, baseline rate of bone turnover, and baseline BMD in the range studied (at least 2 standard deviations below the premenopausal mean). </p>

</div>
<p>In patients with postmenopausal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> treated with alendronate sodium 10 mg/day for one or two years, the effects of treatment withdrawal were assessed. Following discontinuation, there were no further increases in bone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> and the rates of bone loss were similar to those of the placebo groups.  </p>
<p>The therapeutic equivalence of once weekly alendronate sodium 70 mg (n = 519) and alendronate sodium 10 mg daily (n = 370) was demonstrated in a one-year, double-blind, multicenter study of postmenopausal women with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span>. In the primary analysis of completers, the mean increases from baseline in lumbar spine BMD at one year were 5.1% (4.8, 5.4%; 95% CI) in the 70 mg once-weekly group (n = 440) and 5.4% (5.0, 5.8%; 95% CI) in the 10 mg daily group (n = 330). The two treatment groups were also similar with regard to BMD increases at other skeletal sites. The results of the intention-to-treat analysis were consistent with the primary analysis of completers.</p>

<h4>Effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">fracture</span> incidence</h4>
<p class="First">Data on the effects of alendronate sodium on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">fracture</span> incidence are derived from three clinical studies: 1) U.S. and Multinational combined: a study of patients with a BMD T-score at or below minus 2.5 with or without a prior <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4066995" conceptname="Fracture of vertebral column with spinal cord injury">vertebral fracture</span>, 2) Three-Year Study of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">Fracture</span> Intervention Trial (FIT): a study of patients with at least one baseline <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4066995" conceptname="Fracture of vertebral column with spinal cord injury">vertebral fracture</span>, and 3) Four-Year Study of FIT: a study of patients with low bone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> but without a baseline <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4066995" conceptname="Fracture of vertebral column with spinal cord injury">vertebral fracture</span>.</p>
<p>To assess the effects of alendronate sodium on the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4066995" conceptname="Fracture of vertebral column with spinal cord injury">vertebral fractures</span> (detected by digitized radiography; approximately one third of these were clinically symptomatic), the U.S. and Multinational studies were combined in an analysis that compared placebo to the pooled dosage groups of alendronate sodium (5 or 10 mg for three years or 20 mg for two years followed by 5 mg for one year). There was a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of patients treated with alendronate sodium experiencing one or more new <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4066995" conceptname="Fracture of vertebral column with spinal cord injury">vertebral fractures</span> relative to those treated with placebo (3.2% vs. 6.2%; a 48% relative risk reduction). A reduction in the total number of new <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4066995" conceptname="Fracture of vertebral column with spinal cord injury">vertebral fractures</span> (4.2 vs. 11.3 per 100 patients) was also observed. In the pooled analysis, patients who received alendronate sodium had a loss in stature that was statistically significantly less than was observed in those who received placebo (-3.0 mm vs. -4.6 mm). </p>
<p>The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">Fracture</span> Intervention Trial (FIT) consisted of two studies in postmenopausal women: the Three-Year Study of patients who had at least one baseline radiographic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4066995" conceptname="Fracture of vertebral column with spinal cord injury">vertebral fracture</span> and the Four-Year Study of patients with low bone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> but without a baseline <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4066995" conceptname="Fracture of vertebral column with spinal cord injury">vertebral fracture</span>. In both studies of FIT, 96% of randomized patients completed the studies (i.e., had a closeout visit at the scheduled end of the study); approximately 80% of patients were still taking study medication upon completion.</p>

<h4><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">Fracture</span> results across studies</h4>
<p class="First">In the Three-Year Study of FIT, alendronate sodium reduced the percentage of women experiencing at least one new radiographic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4066995" conceptname="Fracture of vertebral column with spinal cord injury">vertebral fracture</span> from 15.0% to 7.9% (47% relative risk reduction, p &lt; 0.001); in the Four-Year Study of FIT, the percentage was reduced from 3.8% to 2.1% (44% relative risk reduction, p = 0.001); and in the combined U.S./Multinational studies, from 6.2% to 3.2% (48% relative risk reduction, p = 0.034).</p>
<p>Alendronate sodium reduced the percentage of women experiencing multiple (two or more) new <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4066995" conceptname="Fracture of vertebral column with spinal cord injury">vertebral fractures</span> from 4.2% to 0.6% (87% relative risk reduction, p &lt; 0.001) in the combined U.S./Multinational studies and from 4.9% to 0.5% (90% relative risk reduction, p &lt; 0.001) in the Three-Year Study of FIT. In the Four-Year Study of FIT, alendronate sodium reduced the percentage of osteoporotic women experiencing multiple <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4066995" conceptname="Fracture of vertebral column with spinal cord injury">vertebral fractures</span> from 0.6% to 0.1% (78% relative risk reduction, p = 0.035).</p>
<p>Thus, alendronate sodium reduced the incidence of radiographic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4066995" conceptname="Fracture of vertebral column with spinal cord injury">vertebral fractures</span> in osteoporotic women whether or not they had a previous radiographic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4066995" conceptname="Fracture of vertebral column with spinal cord injury">vertebral fracture</span>.</p>
<p>Alendronate sodium, over a three- or four-year period, was associated with statistically significant reductions in loss of height vs. placebo in patients with and without baseline radiographic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4066995" conceptname="Fracture of vertebral column with spinal cord injury">vertebral fractures</span>.

<h3>Men</h3>
<p class="First">The efficacy of alendronate sodium in men with hypogonadal or idiopathic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> was demonstrated in two clinical studies.</p>
<p>A two-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of alendronate sodium 10 mg once daily enrolled a total of 241 men between the ages of 31 and 87 (mean, 63). All patients in the trial had either: 1) a BMD T-score ≤ -2 at the femoral neck and ≤ -1 at the lumbar spine, or 2) a baseline <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4188189" conceptname="Osteoporotic fracture">osteoporotic fracture</span> and a BMD T-score ≤ -1 at the femoral neck. At two years, the mean increases relative to placebo in BMD in men receiving alendronate sodium 10 mg/day were significant at the following sites: lumbar spine, 5.3%; femoral neck, 2.6%; trochanter, 3.1%; and total body, 1.6%. Treatment with alendronate sodium also reduced height loss (alendronate sodium, -0.6 mm vs. placebo, -2.4 mm).</p>
<p>A one-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of once weekly alendronate sodium 70 mg enrolled a total of 167 men between the ages of 38 and 91 (mean, 66). Patients in the study had either: 1) a BMD T-score ≤ -2 at the femoral neck and ≤ -1 at the lumbar spine, 2) a BMD T-score ≤ -2 at the lumbar spine and ≤ -1 at the femoral neck, or 3) a baseline <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4188189" conceptname="Osteoporotic fracture">osteoporotic fracture</span> and a BMD T-score ≤ -1 at the femoral neck. At one year, the mean increases relative to placebo in BMD in men receiving alendronate sodium 70 mg once weekly were significant at the following sites: lumbar spine, 2.8%; femoral neck, 1.9%; trochanter, 2.0%; and total body, 1.2%. These increases in BMD were similar to those seen at one year in the 10 mg once-daily study.</p>
<p>In both studies, BMD responses were similar regardless of age (≥ 65 years vs. &lt; 65 years), gonadal function (baseline testosterone &lt; 9 ng/dL vs. ≥ 9 ng/dL), or baseline BMD (femoral neck and lumbar spine T-score ≤ -2.5 vs. &gt; -2.5).</p>

<h3>Prevention of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">Osteoporosis</span> in Postmenopausal Women </h3>
<p class="First">Prevention of bone loss was demonstrated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of postmenopausal women 40 to 60 years of age. One thousand six hundred nine patients (alendronate sodium 5 mg/day; n = 498) who were at least six months postmenopausal were entered into a two-year study without regard to their baseline BMD. In the other study, 447 patients (alendronate sodium 5 mg/day; n = 88), who were between six months and three years postmenopause, were treated for up to three years. In the placebo-treated patients BMD losses of approximately 1% per year were seen at the spine, hip (femoral neck and trochanter) and total body. In contrast, alendronate sodium 5 mg/day prevented bone loss in the majority of patients and induced significant increases in mean bone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> at each of these sites (see figures below). In addition, alendronate sodium 5 mg/day reduced the rate of bone loss at the forearm by approximately half relative to placebo. Alendronate sodium 5 mg/day was similarly effective in this population regardless of age, time since <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span>, race and baseline rate of bone turnover. </p>

<p>The therapeutic equivalence of once weekly alendronate sodium 35 mg (n = 362) and alendronate sodium 5 mg daily (n = 361) was demonstrated in a one-year, double-blind, multicenter study of postmenopausal women without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span>. In the primary analysis of completers, the mean increases from baseline in lumbar spine BMD at one year were 2.9% (2.6, 3.2%; 95% CI) in the 35 mg once-weekly group (n = 307) and 3.2% (2.9, 3.5%; 95% CI) in the 5 mg daily group (n = 298). The two treatment groups were also similar with regard to BMD increases at other skeletal sites. The results of the intention-to-treat analysis were consistent with the primary analysis of completers.</p>

<h3>Concomitant Use With Estrogen/Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)</h3>
<p class="First">The effects on BMD of treatment with alendronate sodium 10 mg once daily and conjugated estrogen (0.625 mg/day) either alone or in combination were assessed in a two-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of hysterectomized postmenopausal osteoporotic women (n = 425). At two years, the increases in lumbar spine BMD from baseline were significantly greater with the combination (8.3%) than with either estrogen or alendronate sodium alone (both 6.0%).</p>
<p>The effects on BMD when alendronate sodium was added to stable doses (for at least one year) of HRT (estrogen ± progestin) were assessed in a one-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in postmenopausal osteoporotic women (n = 428). The addition of alendronate sodium 10 mg once daily to HRT produced, at one year, significantly greater increases in lumbar spine BMD (3.7%) vs. HRT alone (1.1%).</p>
<p>In these studies, significant increases or favorable trends in BMD for combined therapy compared with HRT alone were seen at the total hip, femoral neck, and trochanter. No significant effect was seen for total body BMD.</p>
<p>Histomorphometric studies of transiliac biopsies in 92 subjects showed normal bone architecture. Compared to placebo there was a 98% suppression of bone turnover (as assessed by mineralizing surface) after 18 months of combined treatment with alendronate sodium and HRT, 94% on alendronate sodium alone, and 78% on HRT alone. The long-term effects of combined alendronate sodium and HRT on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">fracture</span> occurrence and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">fracture</span> healing have not been studied.</p>

<h3>Glucocorticoid-Induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">Osteoporosis</span></h3>
<p class="First">The efficacy of alendronate sodium 5 and 10 mg once daily in men and women receiving glucocorticoids (at least 7.5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) was demonstrated in two, one-year, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies of virtually identical design, one performed in the United States and the other in 15 different countries (Multinational [which also included alendronate sodium 2.5 mg/day]). These studies enrolled 232 and 328 patients, respectively, between the ages of 17 and 83 with a variety of glucocorticoid-requiring diseases. Patients received supplemental calcium and vitamin D. The following figure shows the mean increases relative to placebo in BMD of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and trochanter in patients receiving alendronate sodium 5 mg/day for each study.</p>
<div class="Figure">
<img alt="figure 7" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=8751ca1c-1d4d-449a-8021-4106e6a08703&amp;name=1752745b-35fd-4b7e-b676-bff3edd7e8ca-08.jpg"><p class="MultiMediaCaption">Studies in Glucocorticoid – Treated Patients Increase in BMD Alendronate Sodium 5 mg/day at One Year</p>
</div>
<p>After one year, significant increases relative to placebo in BMD were seen in the combined studies at each of these sites in patients who received alendronate sodium 5 mg/day. In the placebo-treated patients, a significant decrease in BMD occurred at the femoral neck (-1.2%), and smaller decreases were seen at the lumbar spine and trochanter. Total body BMD was maintained with alendronate sodium 5 mg/day. The increases in BMD with alendronate 10 mg/day were similar to those with alendronate sodium 5 mg/day in all patients except for postmenopausal women not receiving estrogen therapy. In these women, the increases (relative to placebo) with alendronate sodium 10 mg/day were greater than those with alendronate sodium 5 mg/day at the lumbar spine (4.1% vs. 1.6%) and trochanter (2.8% vs. 1.7%), but not at other sites. Alendronate sodium was effective regardless of dose or duration of glucocorticoid use. In addition, alendronate sodium was similarly effective regardless of age (&lt; 65 vs. ≥ 65 years), race (Caucasian vs. other races), gender, underlying disease, baseline BMD, baseline bone turnover, and use with a variety of common medications.</p>
<p>Bone histology was normal in the 49 patients biopsied at the end of one year who received alendronate sodium at doses of up to 10 mg/day.</p>
<p>Of the original 560 patients in these studies, 208 patients who remained on at least 7.5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent continued into a one-year double-blind extension. After two years of treatment, spine BMD increased by 3.7% and 5.0% relative to placebo with alendronate sodium 5 and 10 mg/day, respectively. Significant increases in BMD (relative to placebo) were also observed at the femoral neck, trochanter, and total body.</p>
<p>After one year, 2.3% of patients treated with alendronate sodium 5 or 10 mg/day (pooled) vs. 3.7% of those treated with placebo experienced a new <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4066995" conceptname="Fracture of vertebral column with spinal cord injury">vertebral fracture</span> (not significant). However, in the population studied for two years, treatment with alendronate sodium (pooled dosage groups: 5 or 10 mg for two years or 2.5 mg for one year followed by 10 mg for one year) significantly reduced the incidence of patients with a new <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4066995" conceptname="Fracture of vertebral column with spinal cord injury">vertebral fracture</span> (alendronate sodium 0.7% vs. placebo 6.8%).</p>

<h3>Paget's Disease of Bone </h3>
<p class="First">The efficacy of alendronate sodium 40 mg once daily for six months was demonstrated in two double-blind clinical studies of male and female patients with moderate to severe Paget’s disease (alkaline phosphatase at least twice the upper limit of normal): a placebo-controlled, multinational study and a U.S. comparative study with etidronate disodium 400 mg/day. The following figure shows the mean percent changes from baseline in serum alkaline phosphatase for up to six months of randomized treatment. </p>
<div class="Figure">
<img alt="Studies in Paget's Disease of Bone Effect on Serum Alkaline Phosphatase of Alendronate Sodium 40 mg/day Versus Placebo or Etidronate 400 mg/day" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=8751ca1c-1d4d-449a-8021-4106e6a08703&amp;name=1752745b-35fd-4b7e-b676-bff3edd7e8ca-09.jpg"><p class="MultiMediaCaption">Studies in Paget’s Disease of Bone Effect on Serum Alkaline Phosphatase of Alendronate Sodium 40 mg/day Versus Placebo or Etidronate 400 mg/day</p>
</div>
<p>At six months the suppression in alkaline phosphatase in patients treated with alendronate sodium was significantly greater than that achieved with etidronate and contrasted with the complete lack of response in placebo-treated patients. Response (defined as either normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase or decrease from baseline ≥ 60%) occurred in approximately 85% of patients treated with alendronate sodium in the combined studies vs. 30% in the etidronate group and 0% in the placebo group. Alendronate sodium was similarly effective regardless of age, gender, race, prior use of other bisphosphonates, or baseline alkaline phosphatase within the range studied (at least twice the upper limit of normal). </p>
<p>Bone histology was evaluated in 33 patients with Paget’s disease treated with alendronate sodium 40 mg/day for 6 months. As in patients treated for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> (see <span class="Bold">Clinical Studies</span>, <span class="Italics">Treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">Osteoporosis</span> in Postmenopausal Women</span>, <span class="Underline">Bone histology</span>), alendronate sodium did not impair mineralization, and the expected decrease in the rate of bone turnover was observed. Normal lamellar bone was produced during treatment with alendronate sodium, even where preexisting bone was woven and disorganized. Overall, bone histology data support the conclusion that bone formed during treatment with alendronate sodium is of normal quality. </p>

<p class="First">The relative inhibitory activities on bone resorption and mineralization of alendronate and etidronate were compared in the Schenk assay, which is based on histological examination of the epiphyses of growing rats. In this assay, the lowest dose of alendronate that interfered with bone mineralization (leading to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432594" conceptname="Osteomalacia">osteomalacia</span>) was 6000 fold the antiresorptive dose.

<p class="First">Alendronate sodium, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when alendronate sodium is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett's esophagus, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31317" conceptname="Dysphagia">dysphagia</span>, other esophageal diseases, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201340" conceptname="Gastritis">gastritis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433516" conceptname="Duodenitis">duodenitis</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcers</span>). </p>
<p>Esophageal adverse experiences, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="30753" conceptname="Esophagitis">esophagitis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="25844" conceptname="Ulcer of esophagus">esophageal ulcers</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4024833" conceptname="Esophageal erosions">esophageal erosions</span>, occasionally with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> and rarely followed by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4268622" conceptname="Stricture of esophagus">esophageal stricture</span> or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium. In some cases these have been severe and required hospitalization. Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to discontinue alendronate sodium and seek medical attention if they develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31317" conceptname="Dysphagia">dysphagia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4147218" conceptname="Swallowing painful">odynophagia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77670" conceptname="Chest pain">retrosternal pain</span> or new or worsening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="23325" conceptname="Heartburn">heartburn</span>. </p>
<p>The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium and/or who fail to swallow oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium with the recommended full glass (6 to 8 oz) of water, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium after developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>). In patients who cannot comply with dosing instructions due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4170893" conceptname="Mental handicap">mental disability</span>, therapy with alendronate sodium should be used under appropriate supervision. </p>
<p>There have been postmarketing reports of gastric and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4057053" conceptname="Acute duodenal ulcer">duodenal ulcers</span> with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications, although no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials.</p>

In patients with these conditions, serum calcium and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435510" conceptname="Hypocalcemia">hypocalcemia</span> should be monitored during therapy with alendronate sodium.</p>
<p>Presumably due to the effects of alendronate sodium on increasing bone mineral, small, asymptomatic decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur, especially in patients with Paget’s disease, in whom the pretreatment rate of bone turnover may be greatly elevated and in patients receiving glucocorticoids, in whom calcium absorption may be decreased.</p>
<p>Ensuring adequate calcium and vitamin D intake is especially important in patients with Paget’s disease of bone and in patients receiving glucocorticoids.</p>

Known risk factors for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77650" conceptname="Aseptic necrosis of bone">osteonecrosis</span> of the jaw include invasive dental procedures (e.g., tooth extraction, dental implants, boney surgery), diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, corticosteroids), poor oral hygiene, and co-morbid disorders (e.g., periodontal and/or other preexisting dental disease, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432585" conceptname="Blood coagulation disorder">coagulopathy</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, ill-fitting dentures). </p>
<p>For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk for ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment. </p>
<p>Patients who develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77650" conceptname="Aseptic necrosis of bone">osteonecrosis</span> of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy should receive care by an oral surgeon.

Causality has not been established as these <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">fractures</span> also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with bisphosphonates. </p>
<p>Atypical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442560" conceptname="Fracture of femur">femur fractures</span> most commonly occur with minimal or no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433633" conceptname="Late effect of superficial injury">trauma</span> to the affected area.

<h3>Glucocorticoid-Induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">Osteoporosis</span></h3>
<p class="First">The risk versus benefit of alendronate sodium for treatment at daily dosages of glucocorticoids less than 7.5 mg of prednisone or equivalent has not been established (see <span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</span>). Before initiating treatment, the hormonal status of both men and women should be ascertained and appropriate replacement considered.</p>
<p>A bone mineral density measurement should be made at the initiation of therapy and repeated after 6 to 12 months of combined alendronate sodium and glucocorticoid treatment.</p>
<p>The efficacy of alendronate sodium for the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> has been shown in patients with a median bone mineral density which was 1.2 standard deviations below the mean for healthy young adults.</p>
<p>The efficacy of alendronate sodium has been established in studies of two years’ duration. The greatest increase in bone mineral density occurred in the first year with maintenance or smaller gains during the second year. Efficacy of alendronate sodium beyond two years has not been studied.</p>

<h3>General</h3>
<p class="First">Physicians should instruct their patients to read the Medication Guide before starting therapy with alendronate sodium and to reread it each time the prescription is renewed. </p>
<p>Patients should be instructed to take supplemental calcium and vitamin D, if daily dietary intake is inadequate. Weight-bearing exercise should be considered along with the modification of certain behavioral factors, such as cigarette smoking and/or excessive alcohol consumption, if these factors exist. </p>

<h2>Dosing Instructions</h2>
<p class="First">Patients should be instructed that the expected benefits of alendronate sodium may only be obtained when it is taken with plain water the first thing upon arising for the day at least 30 minutes before the first food, beverage, or medication of the day. Even dosing with orange juice or coffee has been shown to markedly reduce the absorption of alendronate sodium (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>,<span class="Bold"> Pharmacokinetics</span>,  <span class="Italics">Absorption</span>). </p>
<p>To facilitate delivery to the stomach and thus reduce the potential for esophageal irritation patients should be instructed to swallow each tablet of alendronate sodium with a full glass of water (6 to 8 oz). Patients should be instructed not to lie down for at least 30 minutes <span class="Underline">and</span> until after their first food of the day. Patients should not chew or suck on the tablet because of a potential for oropharyngeal ulceration. Patients should be specifically instructed not to take alendronate sodium at bedtime or before arising for the day. Patients should be informed that failure to follow these instructions may increase their risk of esophageal problems. Patients should be instructed that if they develop symptoms of esophageal disease (such as difficulty or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> upon swallowing, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77670" conceptname="Chest pain">retrosternal pain</span> or new or worsening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="23325" conceptname="Heartburn">heartburn</span>) they should stop taking alendronate sodium and consult their physician. </p>
<p>Patients should be instructed that if they miss a dose of once weekly alendronate sodium, they should take one dose on the morning after they remember. They should not take two doses on the same day but should return to taking one dose once a week, as originally scheduled on their chosen day.</p>

<h3>Estrogen/Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)</h3>
<p class="First">Concomitant use of HRT (estrogen ± progestin) and alendronate sodium was assessed in two clinical studies of one or two years’ duration in postmenopausal osteoporotic women. In these studies, the safety and tolerability profile of the combination was consistent with those of the individual treatments; however, the degree of suppression of bone turnover (as assessed by mineralizing surface) was significantly greater with the combination than with either component alone. The long-term effects of combined alendronate sodium and HRT on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">fracture</span> occurrence have not been studied (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>, <span class="Bold">Clinical Studies</span>, <span class="Italics">Concomitant Use With Estrogen/Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)</span> and <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>, <span class="Bold">Clinical Studies</span>, <span class="Underline">Concomitant use with estrogen/hormone replacement therapy</span>). </p>

<h3>Calcium Supplements/Antacids </h3>
<p class="First">It is likely that calcium supplements, antacids, and some oral medications will interfere with absorption of alendronate sodium. Therefore, patients must wait at least one-half hour after taking alendronate sodium before taking any other oral medications.</p>

<h3>Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) </h3>
<p class="First">Alendronate sodium may be administered to patients taking NSAIDs. In a 3 year, controlled, clinical study (n = 2027) during which a majority of patients received concomitant NSAIDs, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal adverse events was similar in patients taking alendronate sodium 5 or 10 mg/day compared to those taking placebo. However, since NSAID use is associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4318531" conceptname="Gastrointestinal irritation">gastrointestinal irritation</span>, caution should be used during concomitant use with alendronate sodium. </p>

<p>Bisphosphonates are incorporated into the bone matrix, from which they are gradually released over a period of years. The amount of bisphosphonate incorporated into adult bone, and hence, the amount available for release back into the systemic circulation, is directly related to the dose and duration of bisphosphonate use. There are no data on fetal risk in humans. However, there is a theoretical risk of fetal harm, predominantly skeletal, if a woman becomes pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. The impact of variables such as time between cessation of bisphosphonate therapy to conception, the particular bisphosphonate used, and the route of administration (intravenous versus oral) on the risk has not been studied.</p>
<p>There are no studies in pregnant women. Alendronate sodium should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the mother and fetus. </p>

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">The efficacy and safety of alendronate sodium were examined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled two-year study of 139 pediatric patients, aged 4 to 18 years, with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="78257" conceptname="Osteogenesis imperfecta">osteogenesis imperfecta</span>. One-hundred-and-nine patients were randomized to 5 mg alendronate sodium daily (weight &lt; 40 kg) or 10 mg alendronate sodium daily (weight ≥ 40 kg) and 30 patients to placebo. The mean baseline lumbar spine BMD Z-score of the patients was -4.5. The mean change in lumbar spine BMD Z-score from baseline to Month 24 was 1.3 in the alendronate sodium-treated patients and 0.1 in the placebo-treated patients. Treatment with alendronate sodium did not reduce the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">fracture</span>. Sixteen percent of the alendronate sodium patients who sustained a radiologically-confirmed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">fracture</span> by Month 12 of the study had delayed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">fracture</span> healing (callus remodeling) or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">fracture</span> non-union when assessed radiographically at Month 24 compared with 9% of the placebo-treated patients. In alendronate sodium-treated patients, bone histomorphometry data obtained at Month 24 demonstrated decreased bone turnover and delayed mineralization time; however, there were no mineralization defects. There were no statistically significant differences between the alendronate sodium and placebo groups in reduction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129418" conceptname="Bone pain">bone pain</span>.</p>

<h2>Clinical Studies </h2>
<p class="First">In clinical studies of up to five years in duration adverse experiences associated with alendronate sodium usually were mild, and generally did not require discontinuation of therapy. </p>

<h4>Postmenopausal women</h4>
<p class="First">In two identically designed, three-year, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter studies (United States and Multinational; n = 994), discontinuation of therapy due to any clinical adverse experience occurred in 4.1% of 196 patients treated with alendronate sodium 10 mg/day and 6.0% of 397 patients treated with placebo. In the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">Fracture</span> Intervention Trial (n = 6459), discontinuation of therapy due to any clinical adverse experience occurred in 9.1% of 3236 patients treated with alendronate sodium 5 mg/day for 2 years and 10 mg/day for either one or two additional years and 10.1% of 3223 patients treated with placebo. Discontinuations due to upper gastrointestinal adverse experiences were: alendronate sodium, 3.2%; placebo, 2.7%. In these study populations, 49 to 54% had a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302537" conceptname="Digestive system finding">gastrointestinal disorders</span> at baseline and 54 to 89% used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin at some time during the studies.

<h3>Prevention of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">Osteoporosis</span> in Postmenopausal Women </h3>
<p class="First">The safety of alendronate sodium 5 mg/day in postmenopausal women 40 to 60 years of age has been evaluated in three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies involving over 1,400 patients randomized to receive alendronate sodium for either two or three years. In these studies the overall safety profiles of alendronate sodium 5 mg/day and placebo were similar. Discontinuation of therapy due to any clinical adverse experience occurred in 7.5% of 642 patients treated with alendronate sodium 5 mg/day and 5.7% of 648 patients treated with placebo.</p>
<p>In a one-year, double-blind, multicenter study, the overall safety and tolerability profiles of once weekly alendronate sodium 35 mg and alendronate sodium 5 mg daily were similar.</p>
<p>The adverse experiences from these studies considered by the investigators as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related in ≥ 1% of patients treated with either once weekly alendronate sodium 35 mg, alendronate sodium 5 mg/day or placebo are presented in the following table. </p>

<h3>Laboratory Test Findings </h3>
<p class="First">In double-blind, multicenter, controlled studies, asymptomatic, mild, and transient decreases in serum calcium and phosphate were observed in approximately 18% and 10%, respectively, of patients taking alendronate sodium versus approximately 12% and 3% of those taking placebo. However, the incidences of decreases in serum calcium to &lt; 8.0 mg/dL (2.0 mM) and serum phosphate to ≤ 2.0 mg/dL (0.65 mM) were similar in both treatment groups. </p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Alendronate sodium tablets USP must be taken <span class="Italics">at least</span> one-half hour before the first food, beverage, or medication of the day with plain water only (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>,<span class="Bold"> Information for Patients</span>). Other beverages (including mineral water), food, and some medications are likely to reduce the absorption of alendronate sodium tablets USP (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>,<span class="Bold"> Drug Interactions</span>). Waiting less than 30 minutes, or taking alendronate sodium tablets USP with food, beverages (other than plain water) or other medications will lessen the effect of alendronate sodium tablets USP by decreasing its absorption into the body. </p>
<p>Alendronate sodium tablets USP should only be taken upon arising for the day. To facilitate delivery to the stomach and thus reduce the potential for esophageal irritation, an alendronate sodium tablet USP should be swallowed with a full glass of water (6 to 8 oz). Patients should not lie down for at least 30 minutes <span class="Underline">and</span> until after their first food of the day. Alendronate sodium tablets USP should not be taken at bedtime or before arising for the day. Failure to follow these instructions may increase the risk of esophageal adverse experiences (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>;<span class="Bold"> PRECAUTIONS</span>,<span class="Bold"> Information for Patients</span>). </p>
<p>Patients should receive supplemental calcium and vitamin D, if dietary intake is inadequate (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>,<span class="Bold"> General</span>). </p>
<p>No dosage adjustment is necessary for the elderly or for patients with mild-to-moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> (creatinine clearance 35 to 60 mL/min). Alendronate sodium tablets USP are not recommended for patients with more severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> (creatinine clearance &lt; 35 mL/min) due to lack of experience. </p>

<h2>Retreatment of Paget’s Disease</h2>
<p class="First">In clinical studies in which patients were followed every six months, relapses during the 12 months following therapy occurred in 9% (3 out of 32) of patients who responded to treatment with alendronate sodium tablets USP. Specific retreatment data are not available, although responses to alendronate sodium tablets USP were similar in patients who had received prior bisphosphonate therapy and those who had not. Retreatment with alendronate sodium tablets USP may be considered, following a six-month post-treatment evaluation period in patients who have relapsed, based on increases in serum alkaline phosphatase, which should be measured periodically. Retreatment may also be considered in those who failed to normalize their serum alkaline phosphatase.</p>
