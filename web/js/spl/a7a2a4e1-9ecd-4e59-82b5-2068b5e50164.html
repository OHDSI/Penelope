<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Cesamet<span class="Sup">â„¢</span> (nabilone) is a synthetic cannabinoid for oral administration. Nabilone as a raw material occurs as a white to off-white polymorphic crystalline powder. In aqueous media, the solubility of nabilone is less than 0.5 mg/L, with pH values ranging from 1.2 to 7.0.</p>
<p>Chemically, nabilone is similar to the active ingredient found in naturally occurring <span class="Italics">Cannabis sativa L.</span> [Marijuana; delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC)]. Nabilone is (Â±)-<span class="Italics">trans</span>-3-(1,1-dimethylheptyl)-6,6a,7,8,10,10a-hexahydro-1-hydroxy-6-6-dimethyl-9H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-9-one and has the empirical formula C<span class="Sub">24</span>H<span class="Sub">36</span>O<span class="Sub">3</span>. It has a molecular weight of 372.55. The structural formula is as follows:</p>

<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">Cesamet<span class="Sup">â„¢</span> (nabilone) is an orally active synthetic cannabinoid which, like other cannabinoids, has complex effects on the central nervous system (CNS). It has been suggested that the antiemetic effect of nabilone is caused by interaction with the cannabinoid receptor system, i.e. the CB (1) receptor, which has been discovered in neural tissues.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Nontherapeutic Effects:</span> Cesamet, a synthetic cannabinoid, has the potential to be abused and to produce psychological <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>. Cesamet has complex effects on the central nervous system. Its effects on the mental state (i.e., "inner mental life") are similar to those of cannabis. Subjects given Cesamet may experience changes in mood (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142453" conceptname="Feeling high">euphoria</span>, detachment, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, panic, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432590" conceptname="Delusional disorder">paranoia</span>), decrements in cognitive performance and memory, a decreased ability to control drives and impulses, and alterations in the experience of reality (e.g., distortions in the perception of objects and the sense of time, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span>). These phenomena appear to be more common when larger doses of Cesamet are administered; however, a full-blown picture of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychosis</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychotic</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373995" conceptname="Delirium">organic brain syndrome</span>) may occur in patients receiving doses within the lower portion of the therapeutic range.</p>
<p>Data on the chronic use of Cesamet are not available; experience with cannabis suggests that chronic use of cannabinoids may be associated with a variety of untoward effects on motivation, cognition, judgment, as well as other <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436222" conceptname="Altered mental status">mental status changes</span>. Whether these phenomena reflect the underlying character of individuals chronically abusing cannabis or are a result of the use of cannabis is not known.</p>
<p>The simultaneous use of Cesamet and alcohol or barbiturates may produce additive depressive effects on central nervous system function. Possible changes in mood and other adverse behavioral effects may occur in patients receiving Cesamet. Patients should remain under supervision of a responsible adult while using Cesamet.</p>
<p>Cesamet has central nervous system activity. It produces relaxation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142453" conceptname="Feeling high">euphoria</span> in the recommended dosage range. Tolerance to these effects develops rapidly and is readily reversible.</p>
<p>In addition to effects on the mental state, Cesamet has several systemic actions; most prominent are <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226991" conceptname="Aptyalism">dry mouth</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>. Cesamet has been observed to elevate supine and standing heart rates and to cause supine and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span>. In clinical studies, oral administration of 2 mg of Cesamet did produce some decrease in airway resistance in normal controls but had no effect in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>. No other nontherapeutic effects of clinical significance due to Cesamet have been reported.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Absorption and Distribution:</span> Cesamet (nabilone) appears to be completely absorbed from the human gastrointestinal tract when administered orally. Following oral administration of a 2-mg dose of radiolabeled nabilone, peak plasma concentrations of approximately 2 ng/mL nabilone and 10 ng equivalents/mL total radioactivity are achieved within 2.0 hours. The plasma half-life (T<span class="Sub">1/2</span>) values for nabilone and total radioactivity of identified and unidentified metabolites are about 2 and 35 hours, respectively. The initial rapid disappearance of radioactivity represents uptake and distribution of nabilone into tissue and the slower phase elimination by metabolism and excretion. The apparent volume of distribution of nabilone is about 12.5 L/kg.</p>
<p>Nabilone exhibits dose linearity within its therapeutic range. Clinical data suggests that the intake of food does not significantly affect either the rate or extend of absorption.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Metabolism:</span> Metabolism of nabilone is extensive and several metabolites have been identified. Precise information concerning the metabolites that may accumulate is not available. The relative activities of the metabolites and the parent drug have not been established. There are at least two metabolic pathways involved in the biotransformation of nabilone. A minor pathway is initiated by the stereospecific enzymatic reduction of the 9-keto moiety of nabilone to produce the isomeric carbinol metabolite. The peak concentrations of nabilone and its carbinol metabolites are comparable, but their combined exposures in plasma do not account for more than 20% of that of total radioactivity. Secondly, a metabolite of nabilone in feces has been identified as a diol formed by reduction of the 9-keto group plus oxidation at the penultimate carbon of the dimethylheptyl side chain. In addition, there is evidence of extensive metabolism of Cesamet by multiple P450 enzyme isoforms. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> P450 inhibition studies using human liver microsomes showed that nabilone did not significantly inhibit CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4 (using midazolam and nifedipine as substrates). Nabilone had a weak inhibitory effect on CYP 2E1 and 3A4 (using testosterone; IC<span class="Sub">50</span>&gt; 50 Î¼M) and had a moderate inhibitory effect on CYP2C8 and 2C9 (IC<span class="Sub">50</span>&gt; 10 Î¼M). However, in clinical use, the very low nabilone plasma concentration is unlikely to interfere with the P450-mediated degradation of co-administered drugs. Chronic oral administration of 1 mg t.i.d. for 14 days to 3 subjects gave no indication there was any significant accumulation of nabilone. Available evidence suggests that one or more of the metabolites has a terminal elimination half-life that exceeds that of nabilone. Consequently, in repeated use, the metabolites may accumulate at concentrations in excess of the parent drug.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Elimination:</span> The route and rate of the elimination of nabilone and its metabolites are similar to those observed with other cannabinoids, including delta-9-THC (dronabinol). When nabilone is administered intravenously, the drug and its metabolites are eliminated mainly in the feces (approximately 67%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 22%) within 7 days. Of the 67% recovered from the feces, 5% corresponded to the parent compound and 16% to its carbinol metabolite. Following oral administration about 60% of nabilone and its metabolites were recovered in the feces and about 24% in urine. Therefore, it appears that the major excretory pathway is the biliary system.</p>
<p>The effects of age, gender, hepatic dysfunction, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> on the metabolism and elimination of nabilone have not been determined.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Special Populations:</span> The pharmacokinetic profile of Cesamet has not been investigated in either pediatric (See<span class="Bold"><a href="#A12C9253-7429-453F-B23E-FC7D234EF299">PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use</a></span>) or geriatric patients (See<span class="Bold"><a href="#A76AA6DC-CF37-4261-BEF6-B4CDAD8A3D6F">PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use</a></span>).</p>
</div>

<h2>Clinical Trials</h2>
<p class="First">Cesamet was evaluated for its effectiveness and safety in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> induced by cancer chemotherapy in patients receiving a wide variety of chemotherapy regimens, including low-dose cisplatin (20 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) in both placebo-controlled and active controlled (prochlorperazine) trials.</p>
<p>During Cesamet treatment patients reported a higher incidence of adverse effects. The most frequent were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439383" conceptname="Vertigo">vertigo</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226991" conceptname="Aptyalism">dry mouth</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142453" conceptname="Feeling high">euphoria</span>. However, most of the adverse effects occurring with Cesamet were of mild to moderate severity (See<span class="Bold"><a href="#AE508DFC-1DD2-452D-BD92-7D6293A0C3CC">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span>).</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Cesamet capsules are indicated for the treatment of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments. This restriction is required because a substantial proportion of any group of patients treated with Cesamet can be expected to experience disturbing psychotomimetic reactions not observed with other antiemetic agents.</p>
<p>Because of its potential to alter the mental state, Cesamet is intended for use under circumstances that permit close supervision of the patient by a responsible individual particularly during initial use of Cesamet and during dose adjustments.</p>
<p>Cesamet contains nabilone, which is controlled in Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act. Schedule II substances have a high potential for abuse. Prescriptions for Cesamet should be limited to the amount necessary for a single cycle of chemotherapy (i.e., a few days).</p>
<p>Cesamet capsules are not intended to be used on as needed basis or as a first antiemetic product prescribed for a patient.</p>
<p>As with all controlled drugs, prescribers should monitor patients receiving nabilone for signs of excessive use, abuse and misuse. Patients who may be at increase risk for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4279309" conceptname="Substance abuse">substance abuse</span> include those with a personal or family history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4279309" conceptname="Substance abuse">substance abuse</span> (including drug or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433753" conceptname="Alcohol abuse">alcohol abuse</span>) or mental illness.</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34072-9">
<a name="section-7.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">The benefit/risk ratio of Cesamet use should be carefully evaluated in patients with the following medical conditions because of individual variation in response and tolerance to the effects of Cesamet.</p>
<ul class="Disc">
<li><p class="First">Since Cesamet can elevate supine and standing heart rates and cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span>, it should be used with caution in the elderly, and in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> or heart disease.</p></li>
<li><p class="First">Cesamet should also be used with caution in patients with current or previous psychiatric disorders, (including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432876" conceptname="Bipolar I disorder">manic depressive illness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span>) as the symptoms of these disease states may be unmasked by the use of cannabinoids.</p></li>

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Persons taking Cesamet should be alerted to the potential for additive central nervous system <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> resulting from simultaneous use of Cesamet and alcohol or other central nervous system depressants such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates. This combination should be avoided. Patients receiving treatment with Cesamet should be specifically warned not to drive, operate machinery, or engage in any hazardous activity. Patients using Cesamet should be made aware of possible changes in mood and other adverse behavioral effects of the drug so as to avoid panic in the event of such manifestations. Patients should remain under supervision of a responsible adult while using Cesamet.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34073-7">
<a name="section-7.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Potential interactions between Cesamet 2 mg, and diazepam 5 mg; sodium secobarbital 100 mg; alcohol 45 mL (absolute laboratory alcohol); or codeine 65 mg, were evaluated in 15 subjects. Only a single combination was utilized at any one time. The subjects were evaluated according to physiologic (i.e., heart rate and blood pressure), psychometric, psychomotor, and subjective parameters. In this study, as expected, the depressant effects of the combinations were additive. Psychomotor function was particularly impaired with concurrent use of diazepam. Caution must thus be used when administering nabilone in combination with any CNS depressant.</p>
<p>Nabilone is purportedly highly bound to plasma proteins, and therefore, might displace other protein-bound drugs. Therefore, practitioners should monitor patients for a change in dosage requirements when administering nabilone to patients receiving other highly protein-bound drugs. Published reports of drug/drug interactions involving cannabinoids are summarized in the following table.</p>

<h2>Animal Pharmacology and/or Toxicology</h2>
<p class="First">Monkeys treated with Cesamet at doses as high as 2 mg/kg/day for a year experienced no significant adverse events. This result contrasts with the findings in a planned 1-year dog study that was prematurely terminated because of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> in dogs receiving as little as 0.5 mg/kg/day. The earliest <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span>, however, occurred at 56 days in dogs receiving 2 mg/kg/day. The unusual vulnerability of the dog to Cesamet is not understood; it is hypothesized, however, that the explanation lies in the fact that the dog differs markedly from other species in its metabolism of Cesamet.</p>

<h3>Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category C</h3>
<p class="First">Teratology studies conducted in pregnant rats at doses up to 12 mg/kg/day (about 16 times the human dose on a body surface area basis) and in pregnant rabbits at doses up to 3.3 mg/kg/day (about 9 times the human dose on a body surface area basis) did not disclose any evidence for a teratogenic potential of nabilone. However, there was dose related developmental toxicity in both species as evidenced by increases in embryo lethality, fetal resorptions, decreased fetal weights and pregnancy disruptions. In rats, postnatal developmental toxicity was also observed. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal studies cannot rule out the possibility of harm, Cesamet should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in breast milk. Because many drugs including some cannabinoids are excreted in breast milk it is not recommended that Cesamet be given to nursing mothers.</p>

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Safety and effectiveness have not been established in patients younger than 18 years of age. Caution is recommended in prescribing Cesamet to children because of psychoactive effects.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of Cesamet did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Cesamet should be used with caution in elderly patients aged 65 and over because they are generally more sensitive to the psychoactive effects of drugs and Cesamet can elevate supine and standing heart rates and cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span>.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Commonly Encountered Reactions:</span> During controlled clinical trials of Cesamet, virtually all patients experienced at least one adverse reaction. The most commonly encountered events were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439383" conceptname="Vertigo">vertigo</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226991" conceptname="Aptyalism">dry mouth</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142453" conceptname="Feeling high">euphoria</span> (feeling â€œhighâ€?), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437584" conceptname="Ataxia">ataxia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>, and concentration difficulties.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Comparative Incidence of Reactions:</span> Accurate estimates of the incidence of adverse events associated with the use of any drug are difficult to obtain. Estimates are influenced by factors such as drug dose, detection technique, setting, and physician judgments, among others. Consequently, the tables presented below are presented solely to indicate the relative frequency of adverse events reported in representative controlled clinical studies conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Cesamet under relatively similar conditions of use. The figures cited cannot be used to predict precisely the incidence of untoward events in the course of usual medical practice, in which patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. These incidence figures also cannot be compared with those obtained from other clinical studies involving related drug products because each group of drug trials is conducted under a different set of conditions.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to emphasize that these tabulations do not reflect the relative severity and/or clinical importance of the adverse events. A better perspective on the serious adverse events associated with the use of Cesamet is provided in the<span class="Bold"><a href="#A31B9D8B-CEBB-40B0-ABFF-D57C38E227CF">WARNINGS</a></span> and<span class="Bold"><a href="#A40A6375-B11F-4B42-94F5-F630B978F4F3">PRECAUTIONS</a></span> sections.</p>
<p>The following tables list in order of decreasing frequency the adverse reactions encountered by a substantial proportion of patients treated with Cesamet participating in representative controlled clinical trials.</p>

<h1>DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Controlled Substance</span>â€” Cesamet, a synthetic cannabinoid pharmacologically related to <span class="Italics">Cannabis sativa L. </span>(Marijuana; (delta-9-THC) is a highly abusable substance. Cesamet is controlled under Schedule II (CII) of the Controlled Substances Act. Prescriptions for Cesamet should be limited to the amount necessary for a single cycle of chemotherapy (i.e., a few days). Cesamet may produce subjective side effects which may be interpreted as a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142453" conceptname="Feeling high">euphoria</span> or marijuana-like "high" at therapeutic doses.</p>
<p>It is not known what proportion of individuals exposed chronically to Cesamet or other cannabinoids will develop either psychological or physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>. Long term use of these compounds has, however, been associated with disorders of motivation, judgment, and cognition. It is not clear, though, if this is a manifestation of the underlying personalities of chronic users of this class of drugs or if cannabinoids are directly responsible for these effects. An abstinence syndrome has been reported following discontinuation of delta-9-THC at high doses of 200 mg per day for 12 to 16 consecutive days. The acute phase was characterized by psychic distress, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, and signs of autonomic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">hyperactivity</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4170297" conceptname="Sniffles">rhinorrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">loose stools</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="194475" conceptname="Hiccoughs">hiccups</span>). A protracted abstinence phase may have occurred in subjects who reported <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435524" conceptname="Sleep disorder">sleep disturbances</span> for several weeks after delta-9-THC discontinuation.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Abuse </span>â€” Cesamet may produce subjective side effects that may be interpreted as a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142453" conceptname="Feeling high">euphoria</span> or marijuana-like "high" at therapeutic doses. Cesamet was shown to be qualitatively and quantitatively similar to approved oral delta-9-THC in the production of cannabis-like effects, thus demonstrating its potential for abuse.</p>
<p>Preclinical studies performed in both dogs and monkeys demonstrated that Cesamet was cannabinoid-like. As with delta-9-THC, tolerance develops rapidly to the pharmacological effects in both the dog and the monkey. Cross-tolerance between Cesamet and delta-9-THC was demonstrated in the monkey.</p>

Patients who participated in clinical trials of up to 5 days' duration evidenced no withdrawal symptoms on cessation of dosing.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Signs and Symptoms</span> - Signs and symptoms of overdosage are an extension of the psychotomimetic and physiologic effects of Cesamet.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Treatment </span>- To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, a good resource is your certified Regional Poison Control Center. Telephone numbers of certified poison control centers are listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR). In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">multiple drug overdoses</span>, interaction among drugs, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient.</p>
<p>Overdosage may be considered to have occurred, even at prescribed dosages, if disturbing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4294810" conceptname="Psychiatric symptom">psychiatric symptoms</span> are present. In these cases, the patient should be observed in a quiet environment and supportive measures, including reassurance, should be used. Subsequent doses should be withheld until patients have returned to their baseline mental status; routine dosing may then be resumed if clinically indicated. In such instances, a lower initiating dose is suggested. In controlled clinical trials, alterations in mental status related to the use of Cesamet resolved within 72 hours without specific medical therapy.</p>
<p>In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> settings, attention should be paid to vital signs, since both <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> have been known to occur; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span> were most commonly reported.</p>
<p>No cases of overdosage with more than 10 mg/day of nabilone were reported during clinical trials. Signs and symptoms that would be expected to occur in large <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> situations are <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychotic episodes</span>, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety reactions</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychotic episodes</span> occur, the patient should be managed conservatively, if possible. For moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychotic episodes</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety reactions</span>, verbal support and comforting may be sufficient. In more severe cases, antipsychotic drugs may be useful; however, the utility of antipsychotic drugs in cannabinoid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychosis</span> has not been systematically evaluated. Support for their use is drawn from limited experience using antipsychotic agents to manage cannabis <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span>. Because of the potential for drug-drug interactions (e.g., additive CNS depressant effects due to nabilone and chlorpromazine), such patients should be closely monitored.</p>
<p>Protect the patient's airway and support ventilation and perfusion. Meticulously monitor and maintain, within acceptable limits, the patient's vital signs, blood gases, serum electrolytes, as well as other laboratory values and physical assessments. Absorption of drugs from the gastrointestinal tract may be decreased by giving activated charcoal, which, in many cases, is more effective than <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> or lavage; consider charcoal instead of or in addition to gastric emptying. Repeated doses of charcoal over time may hasten elimination of some drugs that have been absorbed. Safeguard the patient's airway when employing gastric emptying or charcoal.</p>
<p>The use of forced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span>, peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, charcoal hemoperfusion, or cholestyramine has not been reported. In the presence of normal renal function, most of a dose of nabilone is eliminated through the biliary system.</p>
<p>Treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">comatose</span> state consists in symptomatic and supportive therapy. Particular attention should be paid to the occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435371" conceptname="Hypothermia">hypothermia</span>. If the patient becomes hypotensive, consider fluids, inotropes, and/or vasopressors.</p>
<p>The estimated oral median lethal dose in female mice is between 1,000 and 2,000 mg/kg; in the female rat, it is greater than 2,000 mg/kg, (See<span class="Bold"><a href="#A3BC7357-A5D9-4D69-A124-F4A126DE4AED">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span>).</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">The usual adult dosage is 1 or 2 mg b.i.d. On the day of chemotherapy, the initial dose should be given 1 to 3 hours before the chemotherapeutic agent is administered. To minimize side effects, it is recommended that the lower starting dose be used and that the dose be increased as necessary. A dose of 1 or 2 mg the night before may be useful. The maximum recommended daily dose is 6 mg given in divided doses t.i.d.</p>
<p>Cesamet may be administered 2 or 3 times daily during the entire course of each cycle of chemotherapy and, if needed, for 48 hours after the last dose of each cycle of chemotherapy.</p>
