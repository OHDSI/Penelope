<h1>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<ul>
<li>The starting dose should be individualized based on the type of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> and whether the patient is insulin-naïve (<a href="#S2.1">2.1</a>, <a href="#S2.2">2.2</a>, <a href="#S2.3">2.3</a>)</li>
<li>Administer subcutaneously once daily at any time of day, but at the same time every day. (<a href="#S2.1">2.1</a>)</li>
<li>Rotate injection sites within an injection area (abdomen, thigh, or deltoid) to reduce the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134324" conceptname="Lipodystrophy">lipodystrophy</span>. (<a href="#S2.1">2.1</a>)</li>
<li>Converting from other insulin therapies may require adjustment of timing and dose of LANTUS. Closely monitor glucoses especially upon converting to LANTUS and during the initial weeks thereafter. (<a href="#S2.3">2.3</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>LANTUS is a recombinant human insulin analog for once daily subcutaneous administration with potency that is approximately the same as the potency of human insulin. LANTUS exhibits a relatively constant glucose-lowering profile over 24 hours that permits once-daily dosing.</p>
<p>LANTUS may be administered at any time during the day. LANTUS should be administered subcutaneously once a day at the same time every day. The dose of LANTUS must be individualized based on clinical response. Blood glucose monitoring is essential in all patients receiving insulin therapy.</p>
<p>Patients adjusting the amount or timing of dosing with LANTUS, should only do so under medical supervision with appropriate glucose monitoring <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#S5.1">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</a></span>.] </p>
<p>In patients with type 1 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, LANTUS must be used in regimens with short-acting insulin.</p>
<p>The intended duration of activity of LANTUS is dependent on injection into subcutaneous tissue <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#S12.2">Clinical pharmacology (12.2)</a>]</span>. LANTUS should not be administered intravenously or via an insulin pump. Intravenous administration of the usual subcutaneous dose could result in severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#S5.3">Warnings and Precautions (5.3)</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>As with all insulins, injection sites should be rotated within the same region (abdomen, thigh, or deltoid) from one injection to the next to reduce the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134324" conceptname="Lipodystrophy">lipodystrophy</span> <span class="Italics">[See <a href="#S6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</a>].</span></p>
<p>In clinical studies, there was no clinically relevant difference in insulin glargine absorption after abdominal, deltoid, or thigh subcutaneous administration. As for all insulins, the rate of absorption, and consequently the onset and duration of action, may be affected by exercise and other variables, such as stress, intercurrent illness, or changes in co-administered drugs or meal patterns<span class="Italics">.</span></p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The recommended starting dose of LANTUS in patients with type 1 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> should be approximately one-third of the total daily insulin requirements. Short-acting, premeal insulin should be used to satisfy the remainder of the daily insulin requirements.</p>
<p>The recommended starting dose of LANTUS in patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> who are not currently treated with insulin is 10 units (or 0.2 Units/kg) once daily, which should subsequently be adjusted to the patient's needs. </p>
<p>The dose of LANTUS should be adjusted according to blood glucose measurements. The dosage of LANTUS should be individualized under the supervision of a healthcare provider in accordance with the needs of the patient. </p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>If changing from a treatment regimen with an intermediate- or long-acting insulin to a regimen with LANTUS, the amount and timing of shorter-acting insulins and doses of any oral anti-diabetic drugs may need to be adjusted. </p>
<ul>
<li>If transferring patients from once-daily NPH insulin to once-daily LANTUS, the recommended initial LANTUS dose is the same as the dose of NPH that is being discontinued.</li>
<li>If transferring patients from twice-daily NPH insulin to once-daily LANTUS, the recommended initial LANTUS dose is 80% of the total NPH dose that is being discontinued. This dose reduction will lower the likelihood of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> [<span class="Italics">see <a href="#S5.3">Warnings and Precautions (5.3)</a>]. </span>

<h1>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<ul>
<li>Dose adjustment and monitoring:  Monitor blood glucose in all patients treated with insulin. Insulin regimens should be modified cautiously and only under medical supervision (<a href="#S5.1">5.1</a>)</li>
<li>Administration: Do not dilute or mix with any other insulin or solution. Do not administer subcutaneously via an insulin pump or intravenously  because severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> can occur (<a href="#S5.2">5.2</a>)</li>
<li>Do not share reusable or disposable insulin devices or needles between patients (<a href="#S5.2">5.2</a>)</li>
<li><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">Hypoglycemia</span>: Most common adverse reaction of insulin therapy and may be life-threatening (<a href="#S5.3">5.3</a>, <a href="#S6.1">6.1</a>)</li>
<li><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">Allergic reactions</span>: Severe, life-threatening, generalized <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergy</span>, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylaxis</span>, can occur (<a href="#S5.4">5.4</a>, <a href="#S6.1">6.1</a>)</li>
<li>Renal or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>:  May require a reduction in the LANTUS dose (<a href="#S5.5">5.5</a>, <a href="#S5.6">5.6</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Glucose monitoring is essential for all patients receiving insulin therapy. Changes to an insulin regimen should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision. </p>
<p>Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may result in the need for a change in insulin dose or an adjustment in concomitant oral anti-diabetic treatment.</p>
<p>As with all insulin preparations, the time course of action for LANTUS may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and is dependent on many conditions, including the local blood supply, local temperature, and physical activity. </p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Do not administer LANTUS intravenously or via an insulin pump. The intended duration of activity of LANTUS is dependent on injection into subcutaneous tissue </p>
<p>Intravenous administration of the usual subcutaneous dose could result in severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#S5.3">Warnings and Precautions (5.3)</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Do not dilute or mix LANTUS with any other insulin or solution. If LANTUS is diluted or mixed, the solution may become cloudy, and the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile (e.g., onset of action, time to peak effect) of LANTUS and the mixed insulin may be altered in an unpredictable manner. When LANTUS and regular human insulin were mixed immediately before injection in dogs, a delayed onset of action and a delayed time to maximum effect for regular human insulin was observed. The total bioavailability of the mixture was also slightly decreased compared to separate injections of LANTUS and regular human insulin. The relevance of these observations in dogs to humans is unknown. </p>
<p>Do not share disposable or reusable insulin devices or needles between patients, because doing so carries a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">Hypoglycemia</span> is the most common adverse reaction of insulin, including LANTUS. The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> increases with intensive glycemic control. Patients must be educated to recognize and manage <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. Severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> can lead to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372448" conceptname="Loss of consciousness">unconsciousness</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. Severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> requiring the assistance of another person or parenteral glucose infusion or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with LANTUS. </p>
<p>The timing of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulations. Other factors such as changes in food intake (e.g., amount of food or timing of meals), exercise, and concomitant medications may also alter the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> [<span class="Italics">See <a href="#S7">Drug Interactions (7)</a></span>]. </p>
<p>The prolonged effect of subcutaneous LANTUS may delay recovery from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. Patients being switched from twice daily NPH insulin to once-daily LANTUS should have their initial LANTUS dose reduced by 20% from the previous total daily NPH dose to reduce the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#S2.3">Dosage and Administration (2.3)</a>].</span></p>
<p>As with all insulins, use caution in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> unawareness and in patients who may be predisposed to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> (e.g., the pediatric population and patients who fast or have erratic food intake). The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery.</p>
<p>Early warning symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions, such as longstanding <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4044391" conceptname="Diabetic neuropathy">diabetic neuropathy</span>, use of medications such as beta-blockers, or intensified glycemic control. These situations may result in severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> (and, possibly, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372448" conceptname="Loss of consciousness">loss of consciousness</span>) prior to the patient's awareness of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>.</p>

<p>Severe, life-threatening, generalized <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergy</span>, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylaxis</span>, can occur with insulin products, including LANTUS.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Due to its long duration of action, Lantus is not recommended during periods of rapidly declining renal function because of the risk for prolonged <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. </p>
<p>Although studies have not been performed in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, a reduction in the LANTUS dose may be required in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> because of reduced insulin metabolism, similar to observations found with other insulins. <span class="Italics">[See <a href="#S12.3">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</a>].</span></p>

<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="376103" conceptname="Retinopathy">Retinopathy</span> was evaluated in the LANTUS clinical studies by analysis of reported retinal adverse events and fundus photography.

<h1>DRUG INTERACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>A number of drugs affect glucose metabolism and may require insulin dose adjustment and particularly close monitoring. </p>
<p>The following are examples of drugs that may increase the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulins including LANTUS and, therefore, increase the susceptibility to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>: oral anti-diabetic products, pramlintide, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, propoxyphene, pentoxifylline, salicylates, somatostatin analogs, and sulfonamide antibiotics.</p>
<p>The following are examples of drugs that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulins including LANTUS: corticosteroids, niacin, danazol, diuretics, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., epinephrine, albuterol, terbutaline), glucagon, isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, thyroid hormones, estrogens, progestogens (e.g., in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medications (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine).</p>

<li>Pregnancy category C: Use during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus (<a href="#S8.1">8.1</a>)</li>
<li>Pediatric: Has not been studied in children with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>.

</ul>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pregnancy Category C: Subcutaneous reproduction and teratology studies have been performed with insulin glargine and regular human insulin in rats and Himalayan rabbits. Insulin glargine was given to female rats before mating, during mating, and throughout pregnancy at doses up to 0.36 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 7 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dose of 10 Units/day (0.008 mg/kg/day), based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>. In rabbits, doses of 0.072 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 2 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dose of 10 Units/day (0.008 mg/kg/day), based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, were administered during organogenesis. The effects of insulin glargine did not generally differ from those observed with regular human insulin in rats or rabbits. However, in rabbits, five fetuses from two litters of the high-dose group exhibited dilation of the cerebral ventricles. Fertility and early embryonic development appeared normal.</p>
<p>There are no well-controlled clinical studies of the use of LANTUS in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is essential for patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> or a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4024659" conceptname="Gestational diabetes mellitus">gestational diabetes</span> to maintain good metabolic control before conception and throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester, generally increase during the second and third trimesters, and rapidly decline after delivery. Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential in these patients.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is unknown whether insulin glargine is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs, including human insulin, are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when LANTUS is administered to a nursing woman. Use of LANTUS is compatible with breastfeeding, but women with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> who are lactating may require adjustments of their insulin doses.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The safety and effectiveness of subcutaneous injections of LANTUS have been established in pediatric patients (age 6 to 15 years) with type 1 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span><span class="Italics"> [see <a href="#S14">Clinical Studies (14)</a>]</span>. LANTUS has not been studied in pediatric patients younger than 6 years of age with type 1 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>. LANTUS has not been studied in pediatric patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>.</p>
<p>Based on the results of a study in pediatric patients, the dose recommendation when switching to LANTUS is the same as that described for adults <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#S2.3">Dosage and Administration (2.3) </a></span>and<span class="Italics"><a href="#S14"> Clinical Studies (14)</a>]. </span>As in adults, the dosage of LANTUS must be individualized in pediatric patients based on metabolic needs and frequent monitoring of blood glucose. </p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>In controlled clinical studies comparing LANTUS to NPH insulin, 593 of 3890 patients (15%) with type 1 and type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> were ≥65 years of age and 80 (2%) patients were ≥75 years of age. In these trials, the only difference in safety or effectiveness in the subpopulation of patients ≥65 years of age compared to the entire study population was a higher incidence of cardiovascular events typically seen in an older population in both LANTUS and NPH insulin-treated patients. </p>
<p>In the ORIGIN trial participants were required to be at least 50 years and older. At entry, 5286 (42.2%) participants were ≥65 years of age and 1034 (8.2%) participants were ≥75 years of age. There was no difference between treatment groups in the time to the first occurrence of primary outcome events for the subgroup of participants aged ≥65yrs or the subgroup with age &lt;65 years old.<span class="Italics"> [See<a href="#S14"> Clinical Studies (14)</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when LANTUS is administered to geriatric patients. In elderly patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, the initial dosing, dose increments, and maintenance dosage should be conservative to avoid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemic reactions</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">Hypoglycemia</span> may be difficult to recognize in the elderly <span class="Italics">[See <a href="#S5.3">Warnings and Precautions (5.3)</a>].</span></p>

<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>LANTUS (insulin glargine [rDNA origin] injection) is a sterile solution of insulin glargine for use as a subcutaneous injection. Insulin glargine is a recombinant human insulin analog that is a long-acting (up to 24-hour duration of action), parenteral blood-glucose-lowering agent [<span class="Italics">See <a href="#S12">Clinical Pharmacology (12)</a></span>]. LANTUS is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing a non-pathogenic laboratory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span> of <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span> (K12) as the production organism. Insulin glargine differs from human insulin in that the amino acid asparagine at position A21 is replaced by glycine and two arginines are added to the C-terminus of the B-chain. Chemically, insulin glargine is 21<span class="Sup">A</span>-Gly-30<span class="Sup">B</span>a-L-Arg-30<span class="Sup">B</span>b-L-Arg-human insulin and has the empirical formula C<span class="Sub">267</span>H<span class="Sub">404</span>N<span class="Sub">72</span>O<span class="Sub">78</span>S<span class="Sub">6 </span>and a molecular weight of 6063. Insulin glargine has the following structural formula:</p>
<p><img alt="MM1" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=13cfe263-6a6a-4b0f-94f4-771ab6a105c0&amp;name=MM1.jpg"></p>
<p>LANTUS consists of insulin glargine dissolved in a clear aqueous fluid. Each milliliter of LANTUS (insulin glargine injection) contains 100 Units (3.6378 mg) insulin glargine.</p>
<p>The 10 mL vial presentation contains the following inactive ingredients per mL: 30 mcg zinc, 2.7 mg m-cresol, 20 mg glycerol 85%, 20 mcg polysorbate 20, and water for injection. </p>
<p>The 3 mL cartridge presentation contains the following inactive ingredients per mL: 30 mcg zinc, 2.7 mg m-cresol, 20 mg glycerol 85%, and water for injection. </p>
<p>The pH is adjusted by addition of aqueous solutions of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. LANTUS has a pH of approximately 4.</p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34090-1">
<a name="section-11"></a><p></p>
<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>The primary activity of insulin, including insulin glargine, is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Insulin glargine is a human insulin analog that has been designed to have low aqueous solubility at neutral pH. At pH 4, as in the LANTUS injection solution, insulin glargine is completely soluble. After injection into the subcutaneous tissue, the acidic solution is neutralized, leading to formation of microprecipitates from which small amounts of insulin glargine are slowly released, resulting in a relatively constant concentration/time profile over 24 hours with no pronounced peak. This profile allows once-daily dosing as a basal insulin.</p>
<p>In clinical studies, the glucose-lowering effect on a molar basis (i.e., when given at the same doses) of intravenous insulin glargine is approximately the same as that for human insulin. In euglycemic clamp studies in healthy subjects or in patients with type 1 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, the onset of action of subcutaneous insulin glargine was slower than NPH insulin. The effect profile of insulin glargine was relatively constant with no pronounced peak and the duration of its effect was prolonged compared to NPH insulin. <span class="Italics">Figure 1</span> shows results from a study in patients with type 1 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> conducted for a maximum of 24 hours after the injection. The median time between injection and the end of pharmacological effect was 14.5 hours (range: 9.5 to 19.3 hours) for NPH insulin, and 24 hours (range: 10.8 to &gt;24.0 hours) (24 hours was the end of the observation period) for insulin glargine.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Figure 1. Activity Profile in Patients with Type 1 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">Diabetes</span></span></p>
<p><img alt="MM2" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=13cfe263-6a6a-4b0f-94f4-771ab6a105c0&amp;name=MM2.jpg"></p>
<p>*    Determined as amount of glucose infused to maintain constant plasma glucose levels (hourly mean values); indicative of insulin activity.</p>
<p>The longer duration of action (up to 24 hours) of LANTUS is directly related to its slower rate of absorption and supports once-daily subcutaneous administration. The time course of action of insulins, including LANTUS, may vary between individuals and within the same individual.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Absorption and Bioavailability. After subcutaneous injection of insulin glargine in healthy subjects and in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, the insulin serum concentrations indicated a slower, more prolonged absorption and a relatively constant concentration/time profile over 24 hours with no pronounced peak in comparison to NPH insulin. Serum insulin concentrations were thus consistent with the time profile of the pharmacodynamic activity of insulin glargine.</p>
<p>After subcutaneous injection of 0.3 Units/kg insulin glargine in patients with type 1 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, a relatively constant concentration/time profile has been demonstrated. The duration of action after abdominal, deltoid, or thigh subcutaneous administration was similar.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Metabolism. A metabolism study in humans indicates that insulin glargine is partly metabolized at the carboxyl terminus of the B chain in the subcutaneous depot to form two active metabolites with in vitro activity similar to that of insulin, M1 (21<span class="Sup">A</span>-Gly-insulin) and M2 (21<span class="Sup">A</span>-Gly-des-30<span class="Sup">B</span>-Thr-insulin). Unchanged drug and these degradation products are also present in the circulation.</p>

<h1>NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>In mice and rats, standard two-year carcinogenicity studies with insulin glargine were performed at doses up to 0.455 mg/kg, which was for the rat approximately 10 times and for the mouse approximately 5 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dose of 10 Units/day (0.008 mg/kg/day), based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>. The findings in female mice were not conclusive due to excessive mortality in all dose groups during the study. Histiocytomas were found at injection sites in male rats (statistically significant) and male mice (not statistically significant) in acid vehicle containing groups. These tumors were not found in female animals, in saline control, or insulin comparator groups using a different vehicle. The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown. </p>
<p>Insulin glargine was not mutagenic in tests for detection of gene mutations in bacteria and mammalian cells (Ames- and HGPRT-test) and in tests for detection of chromosomal aberrations (cytogenetics in vitro in V79 cells and in vivo in Chinese hamsters).</p>
<p>In a combined fertility and prenatal and postnatal study in male and female rats at subcutaneous doses up to 0.36 mg/kg/day, which was approximately 7 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dose of 10 Units/day (0.008 mg/kg/day), based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, maternal toxicity due to dose-dependent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>, including some <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span>, was observed. Consequently, a reduction of the rearing rate occurred in the high-dose group only. Similar effects were observed with NPH insulin.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>The safety and effectiveness of LANTUS given once-daily at bedtime was compared to that of once-daily and twice-daily NPH insulin in open-label, randomized, active-controlled, parallel studies of 2,327 adult patients and 349 pediatric patients with type 1 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus and 1,563 adult patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus (see Tables 8–11), whose primary efficacy aim was the assessment of effects on blood glucose, as measured by HbA1c. In general, the reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) with LANTUS was similar to that with NPH insulin. The overall rates of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> did not differ between patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> treated with LANTUS compared to NPH insulin <span class="Italics">[See <a href="#S6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</a>]</span>. </p>
<p>In the 12,537-participants, 6 to 7 year ORIGIN trial LANTUS was compared to standard glycemic management (largely non-insulin) in reducing cardiovascular (CV) risk as measured by CV outcome events.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Type 1 Diabetes–Adult (see <a href="#table9">Table 9</a>). </p>
<p>In two clinical studies (Studies A and B), patients with type 1 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> (Study A; n=585, Study B; n=534) were randomized to 28 weeks of basal-bolus treatment with LANTUS or NPH insulin. Regular human insulin was administered before each meal. LANTUS was administered at bedtime. NPH insulin was administered once daily at bedtime or in the morning and at bedtime when used twice daily. </p>
<p>In another clinical study (Study C), patients with type 1 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> (n=619) were randomized to 16 weeks of basal-bolus treatment with LANTUS or NPH insulin. Insulin lispro was used before each meal. LANTUS was administered once daily at bedtime and NPH insulin was administered once or twice daily. </p>
<p>In these 3 studies, LANTUS and NPH insulin had similar effects on HbA1c (Table 9) with a similar overall rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> <span class="Italics">[See <a href="#S6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</a>]</span>.</p>

<p>Type 2 Diabetes–Adult (see <a href="#table11">Table 11</a>). </p>
<p>In a randomized, controlled clinical study (Study E) (n=570), LANTUS was evaluated for 52 weeks in combination with oral anti-diabetic medications (a sulfonylurea, metformin, acarbose, or combinations of these drugs). LANTUS administered once daily at bedtime was as effective as NPH insulin administered once daily at bedtime in reducing HbA1c and fasting glucose (Table 11). The rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> was similar in LANTUS and NPH insulin treated patients <span class="Italics">[See <a href="#S6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</a>]</span>. </p>
<p>In a randomized, controlled clinical study (Study F), in patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> not using oral anti-diabetic medications (n=518), a basal-bolus regimen of LANTUS once daily at bedtime or NPH insulin administered once or twice daily was evaluated for 28 weeks. Regular human insulin was used before meals, as needed. LANTUS had similar effectiveness as either once- or twice-daily NPH insulin in reducing HbA1c and fasting glucose (Table 11) with a similar incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> <span class="Italics">[See <a href="#S6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>In a randomized, controlled clinical study (Study G), patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> were randomized to 5 years of treatment with once-daily LANTUS or twice-daily NPH insulin. For patients not previously treated with insulin, the starting dose of LANTUS or NPH insulin was 10 units daily. Patients who were already treated with NPH insulin either continued on the same total daily NPH insulin dose or started LANTUS at a dose that was 80% of the total previous NPH insulin dose. The primary endpoint for this study was a comparison of the progression of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4174977" conceptname="Diabetic retinopathy">diabetic retinopathy</span> by 3 or more steps on the Early Treatment <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4174977" conceptname="Diabetic retinopathy">Diabetic Retinopathy</span> Study (ETDRS) scale. HbA1c change from baseline was a secondary endpoint. Similar glycemic control in the 2 treatment groups was desired in order to not confound the interpretation of the retinal data. Patients or study personnel used an algorithm to adjust the LANTUS and NPH insulin doses to a target fasting plasma glucose ≤100 mg/dL. After the LANTUS or NPH insulin dose was adjusted, other anti-diabetic agents, including pre-meal insulin were to be adjusted or added. The LANTUS group had a smaller mean reduction from baseline in HbA1c compared to the NPH insulin group, which may be explained by the lower daily basal insulin doses in the LANTUS group (Table 11). Both treatment groups had a similar incidence of reported symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. The incidences of severe symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> are given in Table 6 <span class="Italics">[See <a href="#S6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</a>]</span>.</p>

<p>The ORIGIN (Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine INtervention) trial was a, international, multicenter, randomized, 2×2 factorial design study conducted in 12,537 participants with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4308509" conceptname="Impaired fasting glycaemia">impaired fasting glucose</span> (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or early type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus and evidence of CV disease. Participants were randomized to receive LANTUS (n=6264), titrated to a FPG of 95 mg/dL (5.3mM) or less, or Standard Care (n=6273). At baseline participants had a mean age of 63.5 years, mean duration of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> of 5.8 years in those with pre-existing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, and median HbA1c of 6.4%. Median duration of follow-up was approximately 6.2 years.</p>
<p>At the end of the trial 81% of participants randomized to take LANTUS were still on treatment.</p>
<p>Median on-treatment HbA1c values ranged from 5.9 to 6.4 % in the LANTUS group, and 6.2% to 6.6% in the Standard Care group throughout the duration of follow-up.  Median FPG in the LANTUS group was at target (≤95mg/dL) following dose titration for the duration of the study.</p>
<p>The incidences of severe symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> are given in Table 7<span class="Italics"> [See<a href="#S6.1"> Adverse Reactions (6.1)</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>The median of the change in body weight from baseline to the last on-treatment visit was 2.2 kg greater in the Lantus group than in the Standard Care group.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this trial was to examine the effect of LANTUS on two co-primary composite efficacy outcomes. The first one was the time to the first occurrence of CV <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>, nonfatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> (MI), or nonfatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>, and the second one was the time to the first occurrence of any of the first co-primary events, or revascularization procedure (cardiac, carotid, or peripheral), or hospitalization for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>.</p>
<p>Secondary endpoints were:</p>
<ul>
<li>all-cause mortality</li>
<li>a composite microvascular outcome</li>
<li>development of type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, in participants with IGT and/or IFG at baseline</li>
</ul>

<p>Participation in ORIGIN for a median of approximately 6.2 years showed that treatment with Lantus did not alter the risk for cardiovascular outcomes, all-cause mortality or cancer, when compared to standard glucose lowering therapy.  In addition, metabolic control was maintained at a lower level of glycemia, with a decrease in the percentage of participants developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, at a cost of a modest increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span>.</p>

<p>LANTUS Timing of Daily Dosing (see <a href="#table14">Table 14</a>).</p>
<p>The safety and efficacy of LANTUS administered pre-breakfast, pre-dinner, or at bedtime were evaluated in a randomized, controlled clinical study in patients with type 1 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> (study H, n=378). Patients were also treated with insulin lispro at mealtime. LANTUS administered at different times of the day resulted in similar reductions in HbA1c compared to that with bedtime administration (see <a href="#table11">Table 11</a>). In these patients, data are available from 8-point home glucose monitoring. The maximum mean blood glucose was observed just prior to injection of LANTUS regardless of time of administration. </p>
<p>In this study, 5% of patients in the LANTUS-breakfast arm discontinued treatment because of lack of efficacy. No patients in the other two arms discontinued for this reason. The safety and efficacy of LANTUS administered pre-breakfast or at bedtime were also evaluated in a randomized, active-controlled clinical study (Study I, n=697) in patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> not adequately controlled on oral anti-diabetic therapy. All patients in this study also received glimepiride 3 mg daily. LANTUS given before breakfast was at least as effective in lowering HbA1c as LANTUS given at bedtime or NPH insulin given at bedtime (see <a href="#table12">Table 12</a>).</p>

</ul>
<p>Read this "Patient Information" that comes with LANTUS (LAN-tus) before you start using it and each time you get a refill because there may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking with your healthcare provider about your condition or treatment. If you have questions about LANTUS or about <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, talk with your healthcare provider.</p>
<p><span>What is the most important information I should know about LANTUS?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="Bold">Do not change the insulin you are using without talking to your healthcare provider.</span> Any change of insulin should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision.  Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type (for example: Regular, NPH, analogs), species (beef, pork, beef-pork, human) or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin) may need a change in the dose.  This dose change may be needed right away or later on during the first several weeks or months on the new insulin.  Doses of oral anti-diabetic medicines may also need to change, if your insulin is changed.</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">You must test your blood sugar levels while using an insulin, such as LANTUS.</span> Your healthcare provider will tell you how often you should test your blood sugar level, and what to do if it is high or low.</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">Do NOT dilute or mix LANTUS with any other insulin or solution.</span>  It will not work and you may lose blood sugar control, which could be serious.</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">LANTUS</span> comes as U-100 insulin and contains 100 units of LANTUS per milliliter (mL).  One milliliter  of U-100 insulin contains 100 units of insulin.  (1 mL = 1 cc).</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Bold">What is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">Diabetes</span>?</span></p>
<ul>
<li> Your body needs insulin to turn sugar (glucose) into energy. If your body does not make enough insulin, you need to take more insulin so you will not have too much sugar in your blood. </li>
<li> Insulin injections are important in keeping your <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> under control. But the way you live, your diet, careful checking of your blood sugar levels, exercise, and planned physical activity, all work with your insulin to help you control your <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>What is LANTUS?</span></p>
<ul>
<li> LANTUS (insulin glargine [recombinant DNA origin]) is a long-acting insulin.  Because LANTUS is made by recombinant DNA technology (rDNA) and is chemically different from the insulin made by the human body, it is called an insulin analog.  LANTUS is used to treat patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> for the control of high blood sugar. It is used once a day to lower blood sugar.   </li>
<li> LANTUS is a clear, colorless, sterile solution for injection under the skin (subcutaneously). </li>
<li> The active ingredient in LANTUS is insulin glargine.   The concentration of insulin glargine is 100 units per milliliter (mL), or U-100.  LANTUS also contains zinc, metacresol, glycerol, polysorbate 20 and water for injection as inactive ingredients.   Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may be added to adjust the pH.</li>
<li> You need a prescription to get LANTUS. Always be sure you receive the right insulin from the pharmacy.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Who should NOT take LANTUS?</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Do not take LANTUS if you are allergic to insulin glargine</span> or any of the inactive ingredients in LANTUS.  Check with your healthcare provider if you are not sure.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Before starting LANTUS, tell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions including if you:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="Bold">have liver or kidney problems.</span>  Your dose may need to be adjusted.</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.</span>  It is not known if LANTUS may harm your unborn baby. It is very important to maintain control of your blood sugar levels during pregnancy.  Your healthcare provider will decide which insulin is best for you during your pregnancy.</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed.</span>  It is not known whether LANTUS passes into your milk.  Many medicines, including insulin, pass into human milk, and could affect your baby. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby.</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">about all the medicines you take including</span> prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.  </li>
</ul>
<p><span>How should I use LANTUS?</span></p>
<p>See  the <span class="Bold">"Instructions for Use"</span> including the  <span class="Bold">"How do I draw the insulin into the syringe?" section for additional information.</span></p>
<ul>
<li> Follow the instructions given by your healthcare provider about the type or types of insulin you are using.  Do not make any changes with your insulin unless you have talked to your healthcare provider.  Your insulin needs may change because of illness, stress, other medicines, or changes in diet or activity level.  Talk to your healthcare provider about how to adjust your insulin dose.  </li>
<li> You may take LANTUS at any time during the day but you must take it at the same time every day.</li>
<li> Only use LANTUS that is clear and colorless.  If your LANTUS is cloudy or slightly colored, return it to your pharmacy for a replacement.</li>
<li> Follow your healthcare provider's instructions for testing your blood sugar.</li>
<li> Inject LANTUS under your skin (subcutaneously) in your upper arm, abdomen (stomach area), or thigh (upper leg).  Never inject it into a vein or muscle.  </li>
<li> Change (rotate) injection sites within the same body area.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>What kind of syringe should I use?</span></p>
<ul>
<li> Always use a syringe that is marked for U-100 insulin. If you use other than U-100 insulin syringe, you may get the wrong dose of insulin causing serious problems for you, such as a blood sugar level that is too low or too high.  Always use a new needle and syringe each time you give LANTUS injection.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">NEEDLES AND SYRINGES MUST NOT BE SHARED.</span></li>
<li> Disposable syringes and needles should be used only once.  Used syringe and needle should be placed in sharps containers (such as red biohazard containers), hard plastic containers (such as detergent bottles), or metal containers (such as an empty coffee can).  Such containers should be sealed and disposed of properly.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Mixing with LANTUS</span></p>
<ul><li>
<span class="Bold">Do NOT dilute or mix LANTUS with any other insulin or solution.</span> It will not work as intended and you may lose blood sugar control, which could be serious.</li></ul>

<li><span class="Bold">The syringe must be new and does not contain any other medicine.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bold">Do not mix LANTUS with any other type of insulin.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li> Wash your hands with soap and water or with alcohol.</li>
<li> Check the insulin to make sure it is clear and colorless. Do not use the insulin after the expiration date stamped on the label, if it is colored or cloudy, or if you see particles in the solution.</li>
<li> If you are using a new vial, remove the protective cap. <span class="Bold">Do not</span> remove the stopper.<p class="First"><img alt="MM3" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=13cfe263-6a6a-4b0f-94f4-771ab6a105c0&amp;name=MM3.jpg"></p>
</li>
<li> Wipe the top of the vial with an alcohol swab. You do not have to shake the vial of LANTUS before use.<p class="First"><img alt="MM4" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=13cfe263-6a6a-4b0f-94f4-771ab6a105c0&amp;name=MM4.jpg"></p>
</li>
<li> Use a new needle and syringe every time you give an injection. Use disposable syringes and needles only once. Throw them away properly. <span class="Bold">Never</span> share needles and syringes.</li>
<li>Draw air into the syringe equal to your insulin dose. Put the needle through the rubber top of the vial and push the plunger to inject the air into the vial.<p class="First"><img alt="MM5" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=13cfe263-6a6a-4b0f-94f4-771ab6a105c0&amp;name=MM5.jpg">          <img alt="MM6" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=13cfe263-6a6a-4b0f-94f4-771ab6a105c0&amp;name=MM6.jpg"></p>
</li>
<li> Leave the syringe in the vial and turn both upside down. Hold the syringe and vial firmly in one hand.</li>
<li> Make sure the tip of the needle is in the insulin. With your free hand, pull the plunger to withdraw the correct dose into the syringe.<p class="First"><img alt="MM7" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=13cfe263-6a6a-4b0f-94f4-771ab6a105c0&amp;name=MM7.jpg"></p>
</li>
<li> Before you take the needle out of the vial, check the syringe for air bubbles. If bubbles are in the syringe, hold the syringe straight up and tap the side of the syringe until the bubbles float to the top. Push the bubbles out with the plunger and draw insulin back in until you have the correct dose.<p class="First"><img alt="MM8" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=13cfe263-6a6a-4b0f-94f4-771ab6a105c0&amp;name=MM8.jpg"></p>
</li>
<li> Remove the needle from the vial. Do not let the needle touch anything. You are now ready to inject.</li>
</ol>
<p><span>How do I inject LANTUS? </span></p>
<p>Inject LANTUS under your skin. Take LANTUS as prescribed by your healthcare provider.</p>
<p>Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li> Decide on an injection area - either upper arm, thigh or abdomen. Injection sites within an injection area must be different from one injection to the next.</li>
<li> Use alcohol or soap and water to clean the injection site. The injection site should be dry before you inject.<p class="First"><img alt="MM9" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=13cfe263-6a6a-4b0f-94f4-771ab6a105c0&amp;name=MM9.jpg"></p>
</li>
<li> Pinch the skin. Stick the needle in the way your healthcare provider showed you. Release the skin. </li>
<li> Slowly push in the plunger of the syringe all the way, making sure you have injected all the insulin. Leave the needle in the skin for about 10 seconds.<p class="First"><img alt="MM10" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=13cfe263-6a6a-4b0f-94f4-771ab6a105c0&amp;name=MM10.jpg"></p>
</li>
<li> Pull the needle straight out and gently press on the spot where you injected yourself for several seconds. <span class="Bold">Do not rub the area.</span>
</li>
<li> Follow your healthcare providers instructions for throwing away the used needle and syringe. Do not recap the used needle. Used needle and syringe should be placed in sharps containers (such as red biohazard containers), hard plastic containers (such as detergent bottles), or metal containers (such as an empty coffee can). Such containers should be sealed and disposed of properly.</li>
</ol>
<p><span>What can affect how much insulin I need?</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Illness.</span> Illness may change how much insulin you need. It is a good idea to think ahead and make a "sick day" plan with your healthcare provider in advance so you will be ready when this happens. Be sure to test your blood sugar more often and call your healthcare provider if you are sick.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Medicines.  Many medicines can affect your insulin needs.</span> Other medicines, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements, can change the way insulin works.  You may need a different dose of insulin when you are taking certain other medicines.  <span class="Bold">Know all the medicines you take,</span> including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.  You may want to keep a list of the medicines you take.  You can show this list to your healthcare provider anytime you get a new medicine or refill. Your healthcare provider will tell you if your insulin dose needs to be changed. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Meals.</span>  The amount of food you eat can affect your insulin needs.  If you eat less food, skip meals, or eat more food than usual, you may need a different dose of insulin.  Talk to your healthcare provider if you change your diet so that you know how to adjust your LANTUS and other insulin doses.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Alcohol.</span> Alcohol, including beer and wine, may affect the way LANTUS works and affect your blood sugar levels.  Talk to your healthcare provider about drinking alcohol.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Exercise or Activity level.</span> Exercise or activity level may change the way your body uses insulin. Check with your healthcare provider before you start an exercise program because your dose may need to be changed.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Travel.</span> If you travel across time zones, talk with your healthcare provider about how to time your injections. When you travel, wear your medical alert identification. Take extra insulin and supplies with you.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy or nursing. </span> The effects of LANTUS on an unborn child or on a nursing baby are unknown.  Therefore, tell your healthcare provider if you are planning to have a baby, are pregnant, or nursing a baby.   Good control of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> is especially important during pregnancy and nursing. </p>

<p>Read this "Patient Information" that comes with LANTUS (LAN-tus) before you start using it and each time you get a refill because there may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking with your healthcare provider about your condition or treatment. If you have questions about LANTUS or about <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, talk with your healthcare provider.</p>
<p><span>What is the most important information I should know about LANTUS?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="Bold">Do not change the insulin you are using without talking to your healthcare provider. </span>Any change of insulin should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision.  Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type (for example: Regular, NPH, analogs), species (beef, pork, beef-pork, human) or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA versus animal-source insulin) may need a change in the dose.  This dose change may be needed right away or later on during the first several weeks or months on the new insulin.  Doses of oral anti-diabetic medicines may also need to change, if your insulin is changed. </li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">You must test your blood sugar levels while using an insulin, such as LANTUS.</span> Your healthcare provider will tell you how often you should test your blood sugar level, and what to do if it is high or low. </li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">Do NOT dilute or mix LANTUS with any other insulin or solution.</span> It will not work and you may lose blood sugar control, which could be serious.</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">LANTUS </span>comes as U-100 insulin and contains 100 units of LANTUS per milliliter (mL).  One milliliter  of U-100 insulin contains 100 units of insulin.  (1 mL = 1 cc).</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Bold">What is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">Diabetes</span>?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Your body needs insulin to turn sugar (glucose) into energy. If your body does not make enough insulin, you need to take more insulin so you will not have too much sugar in your blood.</li>
<li>Insulin injections are important in keeping your <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> under control. But the way you live, your diet, careful checking of your blood sugar levels, exercise, and planned physical activity, all work with your insulin to help you control your <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>What is LANTUS?</span></p>
<ul>
<li> LANTUS (insulin glargine [recombinant DNA origin]) is a long-acting insulin.   Because LANTUS is made by recombinant DNA technology (rDNA) and is chemically different from the insulin made by the human body, it is called an insulin analog.  LANTUS is used to treat patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> for the control of high blood sugar. It is used once a day to lower blood glucose. </li>
<li> LANTUS is a clear, colorless, sterile solution for injection under the skin (subcutaneously). </li>
<li> The active ingredient in LANTUS is insulin glargine.  The concentration of insulin glargine is 100 units per milliliter (mL), or U-100.  LANTUS also contains zinc, metacresol, glycerol, and water for injection as inactive ingredients.  Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may be added to adjust the pH.</li>
<li> You need a prescription to get LANTUS. Always be sure you receive the right insulin from the pharmacy.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Who should NOT take LANTUS?</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Do not take LANTUS if you are allergic to insulin glargine</span> or any of the inactive ingredients in LANTUS.  Check with your healthcare provider if you are not sure.</p>
<ul><li>
<span class="Bold">Before starting LANTUS, tell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions including if you:</span><ul>
<li>
<span class="Bold">have liver or kidney problems.</span>  Your dose may need to be adjusted.</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.</span>  It is not known if LANTUS may harm your unborn baby. It is very important to maintain control of your blood sugar levels during pregnancy.  Your healthcare provider will decide which insulin is best for you during your pregnancy.</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed.</span>  It is not known whether LANTUS passes into your milk.  Many medicines, including insulin, pass into human milk, and could affect your baby. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby.</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">about all the medicines you take including</span> prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins and herbal supplements. </li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
<p><span>How should I use LANTUS?</span></p>
<p>See<span class="Bold"> the "Instructions for OptiClik<span class="Sup">®</span> Use" section for additional information.</span></p>
<ul>
<li> Follow the instructions given by your healthcare provider about the type or types of insulin you are using.  Do not make any changes with your insulin unless you have talked to your healthcare provider.  Your insulin needs may change because of illness, stress, other medicines, or changes in diet or activity level.  Talk to your healthcare provider about how to adjust your insulin dose.  </li>
<li> You may take LANTUS at any time during the day but you must take it at the same time every day.</li>
<li> Only use LANTUS that is clear and colorless.  If your LANTUS is cloudy or slightly colored, return it to your pharmacy for a replacement.</li>
<li> Follow your healthcare provider's instructions for testing your blood sugar.</li>
<li> Inject LANTUS under your skin (subcutaneously) in your upper arm, abdomen (stomach area), or thigh (upper leg).  Never inject it into a vein or muscle.  </li>
<li> Change (rotate) injection sites within the same body area.  </li>
</ul>
<p><span>What kind of insulin Pen should I use?</span></p>
<ul>
<li> Always use the OptiClik<span class="Sup">®</span> device distributed by sanofi-aventis. If you use any other device than OptiClik<span class="Sup">®</span> insulin Pen with this cartridge, you may get the wrong dose of insulin causing serious problems for you, such as a blood sugar level that is too low or too high.  Always use a new needle each time you give LANTUS injection.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">NEEDLES AND INSULIN PEN MUST NOT BE SHARED.</span></li>
<li>Disposable needle should be used only once.  Used needle should be placed in sharps containers (such as red biohazard containers), hard plastic containers (such as detergent bottles), or metal containers (such as an empty coffee can).  Such containers should be sealed and disposed of properly.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Mixing with LANTUS</span></p>
<ul><li>
<span class="Bold">Do NOT dilute or mix LANTUS with any other insulin or solution.</span> It will not work as intended and you may lose blood sugar control, which could be serious.</li></ul>
<p><span>Instructions for OptiClik<span class="Sup">®</span></span><span>Use</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">It is important to read, understand, and follow the step-by-step instructions in the "OptiClik<span class="Sup">®</span> Instruction Leaflet" before using OptiClik<span class="Sup">®</span> insulin Pen.  Failure to follow the instructions may result in getting too much or too little insulin.</span>  If you have lost your leaflet or have a question, go to www.opticlik.com or call 1-800-633-1610.</p>
<p>The following general notes should be taken into consideration before injecting LANTUS:</p>
<ul>
<li> Always wash your hands before handling the cartridge system and/or the OptiClik<span class="Sup">®</span> insulin Pen.</li>
<li> Always attach a new needle before use. BD Ultra-Fine™ needles<span class="Sup">†</span> are compatible with OptiClik. These are sold separately and are manufactured by BD.</li>
<li> Always perform the safety test before use.</li>
<li> Check the insulin solution in the cartridge system to make sure it is clear, colorless, and free of particles. If it is not, throw it away.</li>
<li> Do NOT mix or dilute LANTUS with any other insulin or solution.  LANTUS will not work if it is mixed or diluted and you may lose blood sugar control, which could be serious.</li>
<li> Decide on an injection area - either upper arm, thigh, or abdomen. Do not use the same injection site as your last injection.</li>
<li> After injecting LANTUS, leave the needle in the skin for an additional 10 seconds. Then pull the needle straight out. Gently press on the spot where you injected yourself for a few seconds. <span class="Bold">Do not rub the area.</span>
</li>
<li> Do not drop the OptiClik<span class="Sup">®</span> insulin Pen.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your blood glucose reading is high or low, tell your healthcare provider so the dose can be adjusted.</p>
<p><span>What can affect how much insulin I need?</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Illness.</span> Illness may change how much insulin you need. It is a good idea to think ahead and make a "sick day" plan with your healthcare provider in advance so you will be ready when this happens. Be sure to test your blood sugar more often and call your healthcare provider if you are sick.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Medicines.  Many medicines can affect your insulin needs.</span> Other medicines, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements, can change the way insulin works.  You may need a different dose of insulin when you are taking certain other medicines. <span class="Bold"> Know all the medicines you take,</span> including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins and herbal supplements.  You may want to keep a list of the medicines you take.  You can show this list to your healthcare provider and pharmacists anytime you get a new medicine or refill. Your healthcare provider will tell you if your insulin dose needs to be changed. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Meals.</span>  The amount of food you eat can affect your insulin needs.  If you eat less food, skip meals, or eat more food than usual, you may need a different dose of insulin.  Talk to your healthcare provider if you change your diet so that you know how to adjust your LANTUS and other insulin doses.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Alcohol. </span>Alcohol, including beer and wine, may affect the way LANTUS works and affect your blood sugar levels.  Talk to your healthcare provider about drinking alcohol.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Exercise or Activity level.</span> Exercise or activity level may change the way your body uses insulin. Check with your healthcare provider before you start an exercise program because your dose may need to be changed.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Travel.</span> If you travel across time zones, talk with your healthcare provider about how to time your injections. When you travel, wear your medical alert identification. Take extra insulin and supplies with you.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy or nursing. </span> The effects of LANTUS on an unborn child or on a nursing baby are unknown.  Therefore, tell your healthcare provider if you are planning to have a baby, are pregnant, or nursing a baby.   Good control of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> is especially important during pregnancy and nursing.   </p>
<p><span>What are the possible side effects of LANTUS and other insulins?</span></p>

<p><span class="Bold">General Warnings and Precautions</span></p>
<p>This pen is only for your use. Do not share it with anyone else.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Insulin</span></p>
<p>Check the label on your Cartridge System to make sure you have the correct insulin before injecting. Using the wrong insulin may result in unwanted changes in blood sugar that could be harmful to your health.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Needles</span></p>
<p>You must use a new sterile needle (intact protective seal) for each injection. This prevents a blocked needle and air bubbles. In order to avoid injuries, replace Outer Needle Cap before removing and disposing of used needles.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Safety test</span></p>
<p>Before each injection, carry out the Safety Test (Step <img alt="MM12" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=13cfe263-6a6a-4b0f-94f4-771ab6a105c0&amp;name=MM12.jpg">). If you do not follow the instructions completely, you may get too much or too little insulin.  Injecting too much or too little insulin dose may lead to unwanted blood sugar changes (see the package leaflet for your insulin). Do not perform the safety test without the needle attached.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Damage to OptiClik<span class="Sup">®</span></span></p>
<p>OptiClik<span class="Sup">®</span> may become damaged by rough handling, dropping, or turning of the Dosage Knob by force. Make sure that no dirt gets in contact with the mechanical parts. You should always make sure that:</p>
<p>a)The Cartridge System is undamaged.b)The Start Button, Dosage Knob, and Digital Dose Display operate properly.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Do not use tools on OptiClik<span class="Sup">®</span>. If you are not sure whether or not your OptiClik<span class="Sup">®</span> is damaged, contact your healthcare professional or call 1-800-633-1610. If damaged, it is no longer safe to use. In an emergency, you can draw up the insulin from the Cartridge System using a <span class="Underline">U-100 insulin syringe</span>.</span></p>
<p>OptiClik<span class="Sup">®</span> should not be used near electrical and electronic equipment.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Step 1:  Inserting the Cartridge System</span></p>
<p>Do not shake the Cartridge System before use. You should look at the solution in the Cartridge System before inserting it into OptiClik<span class="Sup">®</span>.  If the solution is cloudy, slightly colored, or has particles in it, do not use the Cartridge System.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">A. GENERAL NOTES</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Cartridge System</span></p>
<p>The Cartridge System is sold separately. Before every injection, check the appearance of the solution in the Cartridge System and follow the instructions in the "Patient Information" leaflet for the insulin. It is important to follow the directions of this Instruction Leaflet closely to help avoid side effects (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span>, improper dosing). Consult with your healthcare professional before using OptiClik<span class="Sup">®</span>.</p>
<p>Before the use of an unopened, refrigerated Cartridge System, take it out of the refrigerator and leave it at room temperature for about 1 to 2 hours. Do not remove the Cartridge System from packaging until ready to use. This will prevent dust or dirt from getting into the mechanical parts of the Cartridge System.  Use an alcohol swab to wipe the rubber seal on the end of the Cartridge System before inserting the needle. Do not open or manipulate the Cartridge System in any way.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Needles for OptiClik<span class="Sup">®</span></span></p>
<p>BD Ultra-Fine needles are available from BD Consumer Healthcare. Contact your healthcare professional for further information.</p>
<p>Needles may vary from country to country and may not be interchangeable. If you intend to travel abroad, make sure that you have sufficient needles and insulin with you.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Never store OptiClik<span class="Sup">®</span> with a needle attached.</span>  Storing OptiClik<span class="Sup">®</span> with the needle attached may allow insulin to leak from OptiClik<span class="Sup">®</span> and air bubbles to form in the Cartridge System. Used needles should be placed in sharps containers (such as red biohazard containers), hard plastic containers (such as detergent bottles), or metal containers (such as an empty coffee can). Such containers should be sealed and disposed of properly.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Removing air bubbles</span></p>
<p>Air bubbles must be removed before each injection during the Safety Test (Step 3 for Safety Test). If air bubbles still remain, repeat the Safety Test, turning the Dosage Knob to the right until "02" appears on the display. Gently tap the Cartridge System until the air rises to the top of the Cartridge System tip. Then press the Dosage Knob until it stays in. <span class="Underline">If necessary, keep repeating the Safety Test until insulin appears at the tip of the needle.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Setting the dose and Display feature</span></p>
<p>To read the dose correctly, hold OptiClik<span class="Sup">®</span> as shown in Step 4B, Setting the dose. The printed "OptiClik" must be readable left of the dose display. Do not hold the pen upside down when reading the dose display; otherwise you may misread the dose on the Digital Dose Display.<br> The Digital Dose Display shows the delivered dose for 2 minutes after every injection and then turns off to conserve battery power. With the Dosage Knob released the display also switches off after 2 minutes.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">How long will OptiClik<span class="Sup">®</span> last</span></p>

<p><span class="Bold">B. TROUBLESHOOTING</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Safety test</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">No insulin appears at the needle tip during Step 3 </span>(Safety Test):</p>
<p>Repeat Step 3 (Safety Test). If no insulin appears this time either, confirm that:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <span class="Underline">needle</span> is firmly in position. Replace a blocked or defective needle with a new one.</li>
<li>The <span class="Underline">Dosage Knob</span> has been set correctly (always turn the Dosage Knob to the right/clockwise to preselect the dose).<br>Turn the Dosage Knob one click to the right, equal to one unit.</li>
<li>The <span class="Underline">Cartridge System</span> has been inserted correctly. Check by trying to pull the Cartridge System gently out.  If the Cartridge System comes out, reinsert it completely, see Step 1 (Inserting the Cartridge System).  Repeat Step 3 (Safety Test).</li>
<li>The Cartridge System is not empty. If it is empty, insert a new one.  Repeat Step 3 (Safety Test).</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="Bold">You hear no clicking sound during dose-setting:</span></p>
<p>The Cartridge System may have been inserted incorrectly. Check by trying to pull the Cartridge System gently out.  If the Cartridge System comes out, reinsert it completely, see Step 1 (Inserting the Cartridge System).  Repeat Step 3 (Safety Test).</p>
<p>If you still hear no clicking sound, try a new Cartridge System and listen for clicking sound. If there is still no clicking sound, obtain a new OptiClik<span class="Sup">®</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Dose-setting</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Insulin drips from the needle tip during dose-setting:</span></p>
<p>The maximum dose of OptiClik<span class="Sup">®</span> is 80 units. If you continue to dial after reaching 80 units, insulin will drip from the needle and the display will continue to show "80".  In such a case, DO NOT turn back to the required dose, instead dial back (to the left) to "00". Press the Dosage Knob to expel excess insulin and to reset OptiClik<span class="Sup">®</span>. OptiClik<span class="Sup">®</span> is now again ready for dose setting. If you need a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as more than one injection.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">You feel resistance during dose-setting and the Dosage Knob will not turn further forward (to the right):</span></p>
<p>a)You are turning to the left and trying to dial down below zero. Turn the Dosage Knob to the right to dial your dose.b)The Cartridge System is almost empty and no longer contains a sufficient amount of insulin for the dose you need. For example, if there are only 20 units left in the Cartridge System and you need 25 units, the dosage knob will stop at 20 units. You can choose to do one of the following: 1)Do not force the Dosage Knob any further (to the right). Inject the partial dose (20 units in the example), and replace the empty Cartridge System with a new one.  Perform the Safety Test as described in Step 3, then inject the remainder of the dose to equal your total prescribed dose. In the above example, the remaining dose is 5 units.</p>
<p>OR2)Dial back (to the left) to "00". Follow Step 7 (Replacing an empty Cartridge System), Step 1 (Inserting the Cartridge System), Step 2 (Attaching the needle), and Step 3 (Safety Test).c)You have dialed (to the right) past the maximum dose of 80 units and have no needle (or a clogged needle) mounted. Dial completely back (to the left) to "00", and perform Step 2 (Attaching the needle) and Step 3 (Safety Test). Do not force the Dosage Knob to turn further.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">The Dosage Knob does not stop at "00":</span></p>
<p>When turned back completely, the Dosage Knob should stop at "00", however, sometimes it may stop at "02" or "01".  Make sure that a needle is attached; then press the Dosage Knob down (insulin will appear at the tip of the needle).  OptiClik<span class="Sup">®</span> is now ready for dose setting.  </p>
<p><span class="Bold">The Dosage Knob no longer turns after a new Cartridge System has been inserted:</span></p>
<p>Check that the Cartridge System is firmly clicked in. Reseat the Cartridge System and try again. If it still does not work, try again with a new Cartridge System, see Step 1 (Inserting the Cartridge System). Otherwise, get a new OptiClik<span class="Sup">®</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">The Dosage Knob does not come out after you pressed the Start Button:</span></p>
<p>Do not pull out the Dosage Knob.  Check that the Cartridge System is firmly clicked in, see Step 1B-Inserting the Cartridge System.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Insulin injection</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">The Dosage Knob cannot be pressed down for the insulin injection or it does not stay down:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>In setting the dose, you have turned the Dosage Knob so that it is between two dose steps.<br>Turn the Dosage Knob to the right or the left to the desired dose.</li>
<li>The needle may be blocked or defective. Use a new needle.</li>
<li>Avoid pushing the Start Button and Dosage Knob at the same time.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="Bold">After withdrawing the needle from your skin, more than one drop of insulin drips from the needle:</span></p>
<p>It is possible that you may not have injected your full insulin dose. DO NOT try to make up for the shortfall in your insulin dose by giving a second injection (otherwise you will be at risk for low blood sugar).</p>
<p>Please check your blood sugar and consult with your healthcare professional.</p>
<p>You can avoid the problem next time by taking the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove any air bubbles that may be present in the Cartridge System<br>(see "GENERAL NOTES: Removing air bubbles").</li>
<li>After delivering the insulin dose, slowly count to 10 before withdrawing the needle from your skin.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="Bold">Cartridge System replacement</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">The Cartridge System and Pen Body do not click back together properly:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Check that the Dosage Knob is pushed in.</li>
<li>Check that you have put the Cartridge System correctly into the Pen Body.

</ul>
<p>Read this "Patient Information" that comes with LANTUS (LAN-tus) before you start using it and each time you get a refill because there may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking with your healthcare provider about your condition or treatment. If you have questions about LANTUS or about <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, talk with your healthcare provider.</p>
<p><span>What is the most important information I should know about LANTUS?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="Bold">Do not change the insulin you are using without talking to your healthcare provider.</span>  Any change of insulin should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision.  Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type (for example: Regular, NPH, analogs), species (beef, pork, beef-pork, human) or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA versus animal-source insulin) may need a change in the dose.  This dose change may be needed right away or later on during the first several weeks or months on the new insulin.  Doses of oral anti-diabetic medicines may also need to change, if your insulin is changed.</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">You must test your blood sugar levels while using an insulin, such as LANTUS.</span>  Your healthcare provider will tell you how often you should test your blood sugar level, and what to do if it is high or low.</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">Do NOT dilute or mix LANTUS with any other insulin or solution.</span> It will not work and you may lose blood sugar control, which could be serious.</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">LANTUS</span> comes as U-100 insulin and contains 100 units of LANTUS per milliliter (mL).  One milliliter of U-100 insulin contains 100 units of insulin.  (1 mL = 1 cc).</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Bold">What is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">Diabetes</span>?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Your body needs insulin to turn sugar (glucose) into energy. If your body does not make enough insulin, you need to take more insulin so you will not have too much sugar in your blood.</li>
<li>Insulin injections are important in keeping your <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> under control. But the way you live, your diet, careful checking of your blood sugar levels, exercise, and planned physical activity, all work with your insulin to help you control your <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>What is LANTUS?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>LANTUS (insulin glargine [recombinant DNA origin]) is a long-acting insulin.  .  Because Lantus is made by recombinant DNA technology (rDNA) and is chemically different from the insulin made by the human body, it is called an insulin analog.  LANTUS is used to treat patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> for the control of high blood sugar. It is used once a day to lower blood glucose. </li>
<li>LANTUS is a clear, colorless, sterile solution for injection under the skin (subcutaneously). </li>
<li>The active ingredient in LANTUS is insulin glargine.  The concentration of insulin glargine is 100 units per milliliter (mL), or U-100.  LANTUS also contains zinc, metacresol, glycerol, and water for injection as inactive ingredients.  Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may be added to adjust the pH.</li>
<li>You need a prescription to get LANTUS. Always be sure you receive the right insulin from the pharmacy. </li>
</ul>
<p><span>Who should NOT take LANTUS?</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Do not take LANTUS if you are allergic to insulin glargine</span> or any of the inactive ingredients in LANTUS.  Check with your healthcare provider if you are not sure.</p>
<ul><li>
<span class="Bold">Before starting LANTUS, tell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions including if you:</span><ul>
<li>
<span class="Bold">have liver or kidney problems.</span>  Your dose may need to be adjusted.</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.</span>  It is not known if LANTUS may harm your unborn baby. It is very important to maintain control of your blood sugar levels during pregnancy.  Your healthcare provider will decide which insulin is best for you during your pregnancy.</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed.</span>  It is not known whether LANTUS passes into your milk.  Many medicines, including insulin, pass into human milk, and could affect your baby. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby.</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">are taking any other medicines including</span> prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins and herbal supplements. </li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
<p><span class="Bold">How should I use LANTUS?</span></p>
<p>See the "<span class="Bold">Instructions for SoloStar<span class="Sup">®</span> Use" section for additional information.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Follow the instructions given by your healthcare provider about the type or types of insulin you are using.  Do not make any changes with your insulin unless you have talked to your healthcare provider.  Your insulin needs may change because of illness, stress, other medicines, or changes in diet or activity level.  Talk to your healthcare provider about how to adjust your insulin dose.</li>
<li>You may take LANTUS at any time during the day but you must take it at the same time every day.</li>
<li>Only use LANTUS that is clear and colorless.  If your LANTUS is cloudy or slightly colored, return it to your pharmacy for a replacement.</li>
<li>Follow your healthcare provider's instructions for testing your blood sugar.</li>
<li>Inject LANTUS under your skin (subcutaneously) in your upper arm, abdomen (stomach area), or thigh (upper leg).  Never inject it into a vein or muscle.</li>
<li>Change (rotate) injection sites within the same body area. <br><br>
</li>
<li>
<span class="Bold">NEEDLES AND SOLOSTAR<span class="Sup">®</span> MUST NOT BE SHARED.</span><br><br>
</li>
<li>Disposable needles should be used only once.  Used needle should be placed in sharps containers (such as red biohazard containers), hard plastic containers (such as detergent bottles), or metal containers (such as an empty coffee can).  Such containers should be sealed and disposed of properly.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Mixing with LANTUS</span></p>
<ul><li>
<span class="Bold">Do NOT dilute or mix LANTUS with any other insulin or solution.</span> It will not work as intended and you may lose blood sugar control, which could be serious.</li></ul>
<p><span>Instructions for SoloStar<span class="Sup">®</span> Use</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">It is important to read, understand, and follow the step-by-step instructions in the "SoloStar<span class="Sup">®</span> Instruction Leaflet" before using SoloStar<span class="Sup">®</span> disposable insulin Pen.  Failure to follow the instructions may result in getting too much or too little insulin.</span>  If you have lost your leaflet or have a question, go to www.lantus.com or call 1-800-633-1610.</p>
<p>The following general notes should be taken into consideration before injecting LANTUS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always wash your hands before handling the SoloStar<span class="Sup">®</span> disposable insulin Pen.</li>
<li>Always attach a new needle before use. BD Ultra-Fine™ needles<span class="Sup">†</span> are compatible with SoloStar. These are sold separately and are manufactured by BD.</li>
<li>Always perform the safety test before use. </li>
<li>Check the insulin solution in the pen to make sure it is clear, colorless, and free of particles. If it is not, throw it away.</li>
<li>Do NOT mix or dilute LANTUS with any other insulin or solution.  LANTUS will not work if it is mixed or diluted and you may lose blood sugar control, which could be serious.</li>
<li>Decide on an injection area - either upper arm, thigh, or abdomen. Do not use the same injection site as your last injection.</li>
<li>After injecting LANTUS, leave the needle in the skin for an additional 10 seconds. Then pull the needle straight out. Gently press on the spot where you injected yourself for a few seconds. <span class="Bold">Do not rub the area.</span>
</li>
<li>Do not drop the SoloStar<span class="Sup">®</span> disposable insulin Pen.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your blood glucose reading is high or low, tell your healthcare provider so the dose can be adjusted.</p>
<p><span>What can affect how much insulin I need?</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Illness.</span> Illness may change how much insulin you need. It is a good idea to think ahead and make a "sick day" plan with your healthcare provider in advance so you will be ready when this happens. Be sure to test your blood sugar more often and call your healthcare provider if you are sick.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Medicines.  Many medicines can affect your insulin needs.</span> Other medicines, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements, can change the way insulin works.  You may need a different dose of insulin when you are taking certain other medicines.  <span class="Bold">Know all the medicines you take,</span> including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins and herbal supplements.  You may want to keep a list of the medicines you take.  You can show this list to your healthcare provider and pharmacists anytime you get a new medicine or refill. Your healthcare provider will tell you if your insulin dose needs to be changed. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Meals.</span>  The amount of food you eat can affect your insulin needs.  If you eat less food, skip meals, or eat more food than usual, you may need a different dose of insulin.

<p><span class="Bold">Maintenance</span></p>
<p>Protect your SoloStar<span class="Sup">®</span> from dust and dirt.</p>
<p>You can clean the outside of your SoloStar<span class="Sup">®</span> by wiping it with a damp cloth.  </p>
<p>Do not soak, wash or lubricate the pen as this may damage it.</p>
<p>Your SoloStar<span class="Sup">®</span> is designed to work accurately and safely. It should be handled with care. Avoid situations where SoloStar<span class="Sup">®</span> might be damaged. If you are concerned that your SoloStar<span class="Sup">®</span> may be damaged, use a new one.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Step 1. Check the insulin</span></p>
<p>A.Check the label on your SoloStar</p>
<p><span class="Sup">®</span></p>
<p> to make sure you have the correct insulin. The Lantus</p>
<p><span class="Sup">®</span></p>
<p> SoloStar</p>
<p><span class="Sup">®</span></p>
<p> is grey with a purple injection button.B.Take off the pen cap.C.Check the appearance of your insulin. Lantus</p>
<p><span class="Sup">®</span></p>
<p> is a clear insulin. Do not use this SoloStar</p>
<p><span class="Sup">®</span></p>
<p> if the insulin is cloudy, colored or has particles.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Step 2. Attach the needle</span></p>
<p>Always use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination, and potential needle blocks.</p>
<p>A.Wipe the Rubber Seal with alcohol.B.Remove the protective seal from a new needle.C.Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, depending on the needle type).</p>
<p><img alt="MM45" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=13cfe263-6a6a-4b0f-94f4-771ab6a105c0&amp;name=MM45.jpg"></p>
<ul><li>If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause leakage, or break the needle.<p class="First"><img alt="MM46" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=13cfe263-6a6a-4b0f-94f4-771ab6a105c0&amp;name=MM46.jpg"></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span class="Bold">Step 3. Perform a Safety test</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Underline">Always</span> perform the safety test before each injection.</span><br>Performing the safety test ensures that you get an accurate dose by:</p>
<ul>
<li>ensuring that pen and needle work properly</li>
<li>removing air bubbles</li>
</ul>
<p>A.Select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector. </p>
<p><img alt="MM47" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=13cfe263-6a6a-4b0f-94f4-771ab6a105c0&amp;name=MM47.jpg"></p>
<p>B.Take off the outer needle cap and keep it to remove the used needle after injection. Take off the inner needle cap and discard it. </p>
<p><img alt="MM48" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=13cfe263-6a6a-4b0f-94f4-771ab6a105c0&amp;name=MM48.jpg"></p>
<p>C.Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards.D.Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle.  E.Press the injection button all the way in.  Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. </p>
<p><img alt="MM49" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=13cfe263-6a6a-4b0f-94f4-771ab6a105c0&amp;name=MM49.jpg"></p>
<p>You may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen. </p>
<ul>
<li>If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to remove them.</li>
<li>If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again.  </li>
<li>If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your SoloStar<span class="Sup">®</span> may be damaged. Do not use this SoloStar<span class="Sup">®</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Bold">Step 4. Select the dose</span></p>
<p>You can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If you need a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections.</p>
<p>A.Check that the dose window shows "0" following the safety test.  B.Select your required dose (in the </p>
<p><span class="Underline">example</span></p>
<p> below, the selected dose is 30 units). If you turn past your dose, you can turn back down.</p>
<p><img alt="MM50" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=13cfe263-6a6a-4b0f-94f4-771ab6a105c0&amp;name=MM50.jpg"></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not push the injection button while turning, as insulin will come out. </li>
<li>You cannot turn the dosage selector past the number of units left in the pen. Do not force the dosage selector to turn. In this case, either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and complete your dose with a new SoloStar<span class="Sup">®</span> or use a new SoloStar<span class="Sup">®</span> for your full dose.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Bold">Step 5. Inject the dose</span></p>
<p>A.Use the injection method as instructed by your healthcare professional.B.Insert the needle into the skin.</p>
<p><img alt="MM51" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=13cfe263-6a6a-4b0f-94f4-771ab6a105c0&amp;name=MM51.jpg"></p>
<p>C.Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button in all the way.  The number in the dose window will return to "0" as you inject.</p>
<p><img alt="MM52" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=13cfe263-6a6a-4b0f-94f4-771ab6a105c0&amp;name=MM52.jpg"></p>
<p>D.Keep the injection button pressed all the way in. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Underline">Slowly count to 10 before you withdraw the needle from the skin.</span></span></p>
<p> This ensures that the full dose will be delivered.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Step 6. Remove and discard the needle</span></p>
<p>Always remove the needle after each injection and store SoloStar<span class="Sup">®</span> without a needle attached. This helps prevent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contamination and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>  </li>
<li>Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing.</li>
</ul>
<p>A.Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen. To reduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap. </p>
<ul><li>If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing the needle. Follow recommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (e.g. a one handed capping technique) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of infectious diseases.</li></ul>
<p>B.Dispose of the needle safely. Used needles should be placed in sharps containers (such as red biohazard containers), hard plastic containers (such as detergent bottles), or metal containers (such as an empty coffee can). Such containers should be sealed and disposed of properly.</p>
<p>If you are giving an injection to a third person, you should remove the needle in an approved manner to avoid needle-stick injuries.C.Always put the pen cap back on the pen, then store the pen until your next injection.</p>
