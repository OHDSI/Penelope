<h1><span class="Bold"> DESCRIPTION
</span></h1>
<p class="First">Methylphenidate hydrochloride is a mild central nervous system (CNS) stimulant, available as 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg chewable tablets for oral administration. Methylphenidate hydrochloride is methyl α-phenyl-2-piperidineacetate hydrochloride, and its structural formula is</p>

<p>Methylphenidate hydrochloride USP is a white to off-white powder. Its solutions are acid to litmus. It is freely soluble in water, alcohol, and chloroform.</p>
<p>Each Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Chewable Tablet, for oral administration, contains 2.5 mg, 5 mg or 10 mg of methylphenidate hydrochloride USP. In addition, Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Chewable Tablets also contain the following inactive ingredients: aspartame, maltose, microcrystalline cellulose, grape flavor, pregelatinized starch, phosphoric acid, and stearic acid.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</span></h1>
<p class="First">Methylphenidate is a racemic mixture comprised of the <span class="Italics">d</span>- and <span class="Italics">l-threo</span> enantiomers. The <span class="Italics">d-threo</span> enantiomer is more pharmacologically active than the <span class="Italics">l-threo</span> enantiomer.</p>
<p>Methylphenidate HCl is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant.</p>
<p>The mode of therapeutic action in humans is not completely understood, but methylphenidate presumably activates the brain stem arousal system and cortex to produce its stimulant effect. Methylphenidate is thought to block the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space.</p>
<p>There is neither specific evidence which clearly establishes the mechanism whereby Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Chewable Tablets produces its mental and behavioral effects in children, nor conclusive evidence regarding how these effects relate to the condition of the central nervous system.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold Italics">Pharmacokinetics
</span></h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p>
<p>Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Chewable Tablets are readily absorbed. Following oral administration of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Chewable Tablets, peak plasma methylphenidate concentrations are achieved at about 1 to 2 hours. Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Chewable Tablets have been shown to be bioequivalent to Ritalin<span class="Sup">®</span> tablet. The mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> following a 20 mg dose is approximately10 ng/mL.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Food Effect</span></p>
<p>In a study in adult volunteers investigating the effects of a high-fat meal on the bioavailability of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Chewable Tablets at a dose of 20 mg, the presence of food delayed the peak concentrations by approximately 1 hour (1.5 hours, fasted and 2.4 hours, fed). Overall, a high-fat meal increased the AUC of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Chewable Tablets by about 20%, on average. Through a cross-study comparison, the magnitude of food effect is found to be comparable between the Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Chewable Tablets and Ritalin, the immediate release tablet.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold">Metabolism and Excretion
</span></h3>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-2.1.1.1"></a><p></p>
<h4>In humans, methylphenidate is metabolized primarily via deesterification to alpha-phenylpiperidine acetic acid (PPA, ritalinic acid). The metabolite has little or no pharmacologic activity.</h4>
<p class="First">After oral dosing of radiolabeled methylphenidate in humans, about 90% of the radioactivity was recovered in urine. The main urinary metabolite was PPA, accounting for approximately 80% of the dose.</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of the Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Chewable Tablets have been studied in healthy adult volunteers. The mean terminal half-life (t<span class="Sub">½</span>) of methylphenidate following administration of 20 mg Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Chewable Tablets (t<span class="Sub">½</span> = 3 hours) is comparable to the mean terminal t<span class="Sub">½</span> following administration of Ritalin (methylphenidate hydrochloride immediate-release tablets) (t<span class="Sub">½</span> = 2.8 hours) in healthy adult volunteers.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Special Populations</span></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Gender</span> – The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate after Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Chewable Tablets administration has not been studied.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Race</span> – The influence of race on the pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate after Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Chewable Tablets administration has not been studied.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Age</span> – The pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate after Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Chewable Tablets administration have not been studied in pediatrics.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span></span></p>
<p>There is no experience with the use of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Chewable Tablets in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>. After oral administration of radiolabeled methylphenidate in humans, methylphenidate was extensively metabolized and approximately 80% of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine in the form of ritalinic acid. Since renal clearance is not an important route of methylphenidate clearance, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> is expected to have little effect on the pharmacokinetics of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Chewable Tablets.</p>

<div class="Section">
<a name="section-3.1.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Specific etiology of this syndrome is unknown, and there is no single diagnostic test. Adequate diagnosis requires the use not only of medical but of special psychological, educational, and social resources.</h3>
<p class="First">Characteristics commonly reported include: chronic history of short attention span, distractibility, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4078201" conceptname="Mood swings">emotional lability</span>, impulsivity, and moderate-to-severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">hyperactivity</span>; minor neurological signs and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168553" conceptname="Electroencephalogram abnormal">abnormal EEG</span>. Learning may or may not be impaired. The diagnosis must be based upon a complete history and evaluation of the child and not solely on the presence of one or more of these characteristics.</p>
<p>Drug treatment is not indicated for all children with this syndrome. Stimulants are not intended for use in the child who exhibits symptoms secondary to environmental factors and/or primary psychiatric disorders, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychosis</span>. Appropriate educational placement is essential and psychosocial intervention is generally necessary. When remedial measures alone are insufficient, the decision to prescribe stimulant medication will depend upon the physician's assessment of the chronicity and severity of the child's symptoms.</p>

<p>Published data are inadequate to determine whether chronic use of amphetamines may cause a similar suppression of growth, however, it is anticipated that they likely have this effect as well.

<h2><span class="Bold Italics">Information for Patients
</span></h2>
<p class="First">Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with methylphenidate and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide is available for Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Chewable Tablets. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.</p>
<p>Physicians are advised to discuss the following issues with patients for whom they prescribe Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Chewable Tablets:</p>

<h2><span class="Bold Italics">Drug Interactions
</span></h2>
<p class="First">Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Chewable Tablets may decrease the hypotensive effect of guanethidine. Use cautiously with pressor agents.</p>
<p>Human pharmacologic studies have shown that Methylphenidate hydrochloride may inhibit the metabolism of coumarin anticoagulants, anticonvulsants (phenobarbital, diphenylhydantoin, primidone), phenylbutazone, and tricyclic drugs (imipramine, clomipramine, desipramine). Downward dosage adjustments of these drugs may be required when given concomitantly with Methylphenidate hydrochloride.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold Italics">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
</span></h2>
<p class="First">In a lifetime carcinogenicity study carried out in B6C3F1 mice, methylphenidate caused an increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4301500" conceptname="Liver cell adenoma">hepatocellular adenomas</span> and, in males only, an increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4001172" conceptname="Hepatoblastoma">hepatoblastomas</span>, at a daily dose of approximately 60 mg/kg/day. This dose is approximately 30 times and 2.5 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/kg and mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, respectively. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4001172" conceptname="Hepatoblastoma">Hepatoblastoma</span> is a relatively rare rodent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197506" conceptname="Malignant neoplasm of abdomen">malignant tumor</span> type. There was no increase in total malignant hepatic tumors. The mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span> used is sensitive to the development of hepatic tumors, and the significance of these results to humans is unknown.</p>
<p>Methylphenidate did not cause any increase in tumors in a lifetime carcinogenicity study carried out in F344 rats; the highest dose used was approximately 45 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 22 times and 4 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/kg and mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, respectively.</p>
<p>Methylphenidate was not mutagenic in the in vitro Ames reverse mutation assay or in the in vitro mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> cell forward mutation assay. Sister chromatid exchanges and chromosome aberrations were increased, indicative of a weak clastogenic response, in an in vitro assay in cultured Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. The genotoxic potential of methylphenidate has not been evaluated in an in vivo assay.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Usage in Pregnancy</span></p>
<p>Adequate animal reproduction studies to establish safe use of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Chewable Tablets during pregnancy have not been conducted. However, in a recently conducted study, methylphenidate has been shown to have teratogenic effects in rabbits when given in doses of 200 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 167 times and 78 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/kg and a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, respectively. In rats, teratogenic effects were not seen when the drug was given in doses of 75 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 62.5 and 13.5 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/kg and a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, respectively. Therefore, until more information is available, methylphenidate should not be prescribed for women of childbearing age unless, in the opinion of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible risks.</p>
