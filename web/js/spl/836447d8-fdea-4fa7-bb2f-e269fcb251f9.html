<p></p>
<p>Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see <a href="#b51f3e12-1651-4b2e-b3c9-f97ab1ebd407">Drug Interactions (7.1)</a> and <a href="#be18af9d-d853-4414-bbcf-f5aa6e7450a7">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</a>]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see <a href="#b51f3e12-1651-4b2e-b3c9-f97ab1ebd407">Drug Interactions (7.1)</a> and <a href="#be18af9d-d853-4414-bbcf-f5aa6e7450a7">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</a>].</p>
<p>Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see <a href="#b51f3e12-1651-4b2e-b3c9-f97ab1ebd407">Drug Interactions (7.1)</a> and <a href="#be18af9d-d853-4414-bbcf-f5aa6e7450a7">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</a>].</p>
<p>Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see <a href="#baf510cc-42d2-43cc-95e3-5d99bcc6576f">Drug Interactions (7.2)</a> and <a href="#be18af9d-d853-4414-bbcf-f5aa6e7450a7">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</a>].</p>
<p>Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> [see <a href="#b363cbae-aaec-4197-b09f-283b50387444">Drug Interactions (7.3)</a> and <a href="#be18af9d-d853-4414-bbcf-f5aa6e7450a7">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</a>].</p>
<p>Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP [See <a href="#ba2b33a9-83ab-409f-b512-f3cdd6cce2bd">Drug Interactions (7.4)</a> and <a href="#be18af9d-d853-4414-bbcf-f5aa6e7450a7">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</a>].</p>

<p>Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha<span class="Sub">1</span> antagonists, has been associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315586" conceptname="Priapism">priapism</span> (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">impotence</span> if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [see <a href="#b5065e33-c9ce-4ee0-aaf3-d5fe28ba0a72">Patient Counseling Information (17.2)</a>].</p>

<p>Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP and at regular intervals afterwards [see <a href="#be83976b-1060-49df-9cb5-37adbed72727">Patient Counseling Information (17.3)</a>].</p>

<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436397" conceptname="Intraoperative floppy iris syndrome">Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome</span> (IFIS) has been observed during <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">cataract</span> surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha<span class="Sub">1</span> blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP [see <a href="#bcc9ca7b-5d9b-42d7-8c99-e90bcbeeb1ff">Adverse Reactions (6.2)</a>].</p>
<p>Most reports were in patients taking the alpha<span class="Sub">1</span> blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha<span class="Sub">1</span> blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha<span class="Sub">1</span> blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha<span class="Sub">1</span> blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435279" conceptname="Tonic pupillary reaction">miosis</span> despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances.</p>
<p>IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation.Â  The benefit of stopping alpha<span class="Sub">1</span> blocker therapy prior to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">cataract</span> surgery has not been established.Â  The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">cataract</span> surgery is scheduled is not recommended.</p>

<p>In patients with sulfa <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergy</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergic reaction</span> to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergy</span>, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP.</p>

<p>Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p>
<p>The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in â‰¥2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men.</p>

<p>In the two U.S. studies, symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span> was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by no patients in the placebo group. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">Syncope</span> was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">Dizziness</span> was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439383" conceptname="Vertigo">Vertigo</span> was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group.</p>
<p>Multiple testing for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span> was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of â‰¥20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure â‰¥10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure &lt;65 mm Hg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of â‰¥20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate â‰¥100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">lightheadedness</span>/lightheaded, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439383" conceptname="Vertigo">spinning sensation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439383" conceptname="Vertigo">vertigo</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span>) upon standing during the orthostatic test.</p>
<p>Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsulesÂ  USP, 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1).</p>
<p>In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group.</p>

<p><span class="Italics">Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6</span></p>
<p>Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6.</p>
<p>Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see <a href="#bb8f598d-3afb-4680-ab20-cf010043c472">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</a> and <a href="#be18af9d-d853-4414-bbcf-f5aa6e7450a7">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</a>]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP have not been evaluated [see <a href="#bb8f598d-3afb-4680-ab20-cf010043c472">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</a> and <a href="#be18af9d-d853-4414-bbcf-f5aa6e7450a7">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</a>].</p>
<p>Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see <a href="#bb8f598d-3afb-4680-ab20-cf010043c472">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</a> and <a href="#be18af9d-d853-4414-bbcf-f5aa6e7450a7">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</a>]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg are co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see <a href="#bb8f598d-3afb-4680-ab20-cf010043c472">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</a> and <a href="#be18af9d-d853-4414-bbcf-f5aa6e7450a7">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</a>].</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>The symptoms associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198803" conceptname="Benign prostatic hyperplasia">benign prostatic hyperplasia</span> (BPH) are related to bladder outlet obstruction, which is comprised of two underlying components: static and dynamic. The static component is related to an increase in prostate size caused, in part, by a proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the prostatic stroma. However, the severity of BPH symptoms and the degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4318847" conceptname="Obstruction of urethra">urethral obstruction</span> do not correlate well with the size of the prostate. The dynamic component is a function of an increase in smooth muscle tone in the prostate and bladder neck leading to constriction of the bladder outlet. Smooth muscle tone is mediated by the sympathetic nervous stimulation of alpha<span class="Sub">1</span> adrenoceptors, which are abundant in the prostate, prostatic capsule, prostatic urethra, and bladder neck. Blockade of these adrenoceptors can cause smooth muscles in the bladder neck and prostate to relax, resulting in an improvement in urine flow rate and a reduction in symptoms of BPH.</p>
<p>Tamsulosin, an alpha<span class="Sub">1</span> adrenoceptor blocking agent, exhibits selectivity for alpha<span class="Sub">1</span> receptors in the human prostate. At least three discrete alpha<span class="Sub">1</span> adrenoceptor subtypes have been identified: alpha<span class="Sub">1A</span>, alpha<span class="Sub">1B</span>, and alpha<span class="Sub">1D</span>; their distribution differs between human organs and tissue. Approximately 70% of the alpha<span class="Sub">1</span> receptors in the human prostate are of the alpha<span class="Sub">1A</span> subtype.</p>
<p>Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are not intended for use as an antihypertensive drug.</p>

<p>The pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have been evaluated in adult healthy volunteers and patients with BPH after single and/or multiple administration with doses ranging from 0.1 mg to 1 mg.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></p>
<p>Absorption of tamsulosin hydrochloride from tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg is essentially complete (&gt;90%) following oral administration under fasting conditions. Tamsulosin hydrochloride exhibits linear kinetics following single and multiple dosing, with achievement of steady-state concentrations by the fifth day of once-a-day dosing.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Effect of Food</span></p>
<p>The time to maximum concentration (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) is reached by 4 to 5 hours under fasting conditions and by 6 to 7 hours when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are administered with food. Taking tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP under fasted conditions results in a 30% increase in bioavailability (AUC) and 40% to 70% increase in peak concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) compared to fed conditions (Figure 1).</p>

<p><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></p>
<p>The mean steady-state apparent volume of distribution of tamsulosin hydrochloride after intravenous administration to 10 healthy male adults was 16 L, which is suggestive of distribution into extracellular fluids in the body.</p>
<p>Tamsulosin hydrochloride is extensively bound to human plasma proteins (94% to 99%), primarily alpha<span class="Sub">1</span> acid glycoprotein (AAG), with linear binding over a wide concentration range (20 to 600 ng/mL). The results of two-way <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies indicate that the binding of tamsulosin hydrochloride to human plasma proteins is not affected by amitriptyline, diclofenac, glyburide, simvastatin plus simvastatin-hydroxy acid metabolite, warfarin, diazepam, propranolol, trichlormethiazide, or chlormadinone. Likewise, tamsulosin hydrochloride had no effect on the extent of binding of these drugs.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p>
<p>There is no enantiomeric bioconversion from tamsulosin hydrochloride [R(-) isomer] to the S(+) isomer in humans. Tamsulosin hydrochloride is extensively metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver and less than 10% of the dose is excreted in urine unchanged. However, the pharmacokinetic profile of the metabolites in humans has not been established. Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, as well as via some minor participation of other CYP isoenzymes. Inhibition of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes may lead to increased exposure to tamsulosin [see <a href="#bb8f598d-3afb-4680-ab20-cf010043c472">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</a> and <a href="#b51f3e12-1651-4b2e-b3c9-f97ab1ebd407">Drug Interactions (7.1)</a>]. The metabolites of tamsulosin hydrochloride undergo extensive conjugation to glucuronide or sulfate prior to renal excretion.</p>
<p>Incubations with human liver microsomes showed no evidence of clinically significant metabolic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride and amitriptyline, albuterol (beta agonist), glyburide (glibenclamide) and finasteride (5alpha-reductase inhibitor for treatment of BPH). However, results of the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> testing of the tamsulosin hydrochloride interaction with diclofenac and warfarin were equivocal.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p>
<p>On administration of the radiolabeled dose of tamsulosin hydrochloride to 4 healthy volunteers, 97% of the administered radioactivity was recovered, with urine (76%) representing the primary route of excretion compared to feces (21%) over 168 hours.</p>
<p>Following intravenous or oral administration of an immediate-release formulation, the elimination half-life of tamsulosin hydrochloride in plasma ranged from 5 to 7 hours. Because of absorption rate-controlled pharmacokinetics with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, the apparent half-life of tamsulosin hydrochloride is approximately 9 to 13 hours in healthy volunteers and 14 to 15 hours in the target population.</p>
<p>Tamsulosin hydrochloride undergoes restrictive clearance in humans, with a relatively low systemic clearance (2.88 L/h).</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Specific Populations</span></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Pediatric Use </span></p>
<p>Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are not indicated for use in pediatric populations [see <a href="#bca3bd61-a50b-42ab-b496-bc76f93d64d0">Use in Specific Populations (8.4)</a>].</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Geriatric (Age) Use </span></p>
<p>Cross-study comparison of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP overall exposure (AUC) and half-life indicates that the pharmacokinetic disposition of tamsulosin hydrochloride may be slightly prolonged in geriatric males compared to young, healthy male volunteers. Intrinsic clearance is independent of tamsulosin hydrochloride binding to AAG, but diminishes with age, resulting in a 40% overall higher exposure (AUC) in subjects of age 55 to 75 years compared to subjects of age 20 to 32 years [see <a href="#bbd6ff55-8d0e-4eec-b310-16b3e1cbea24">Use in Specific Populations (8.5)</a>].</p>

While a change in the overall plasma concentration of tamsulosin hydrochloride was observed as the result of altered binding to AAG, the unbound (active) concentration of tamsulosin hydrochloride, as well as the intrinsic clearance, remained relatively constant. Therefore, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> do not require an adjustment in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP dosing. However, patients with end-stage <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span> (CL<span class="Sub">cr</span>&lt;10 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>) have not been studied [see <a href="#b167ff9e-df98-46f1-9f45-0d8d274ca2ad">Use in Specific Populations (8.6)</a>].</p>

While a change in the overall plasma concentration of tamsulosin hydrochloride was observed as the result of altered binding to AAG, the unbound (active) concentration of tamsulosin hydrochloride does not change significantly, with only a modest (32%) change in intrinsic clearance of unbound tamsulosin hydrochloride. Therefore, patients with moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> do not require an adjustment in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP dosage.

<p>The effects of ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) at 400 mg once daily for 5 days on the pharmacokinetics of a single tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule USP, 0.4 mg dose was investigated in 24 healthy volunteers (age range 23 to 47 years). Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole resulted in an increase in the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see <a href="#bb8f598d-3afb-4680-ab20-cf010043c472">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</a> and <a href="#be18af9d-d853-4414-bbcf-f5aa6e7450a7">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</a>]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP have not been evaluated [see <a href="#bb8f598d-3afb-4680-ab20-cf010043c472">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</a> and <a href="#b51f3e12-1651-4b2e-b3c9-f97ab1ebd407">Drug Interactions (7.1)</a>].</p>
<p>The effects of paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) at 20 mg once daily for 9 days on the pharmacokinetics of a single tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule USP, 0.4 mg dose was investigated in 24 healthy volunteers (age range 23 to 47 years). Concomitant treatment with paroxetine resulted in an increase in the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see <a href="#bb8f598d-3afb-4680-ab20-cf010043c472">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</a> and <a href="#b51f3e12-1651-4b2e-b3c9-f97ab1ebd407">Drug Interactions (7.1)</a>]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). A fraction of the population (about 7% of Caucasians and 2% of African Americans) are CYP2D6 PMs. Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg are co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see <a href="#bb8f598d-3afb-4680-ab20-cf010043c472">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</a> and <a href="#b51f3e12-1651-4b2e-b3c9-f97ab1ebd407">Drug Interactions (7.1)</a>].</p>

<p>The effects of co-administration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP have not been evaluated.

<p>The effects of cimetidine at the highest recommended dose (400 mg every 6 hours for 6 days) on the pharmacokinetics of a single tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule USP, 0.4 mg dose was investigated in 10 healthy volunteers (age range 21 to 38 years). Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see <a href="#bb8f598d-3afb-4680-ab20-cf010043c472">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</a> and <a href="#b51f3e12-1651-4b2e-b3c9-f97ab1ebd407">Drug Interactions (7.1)</a>].</p>

<h1>NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>Rats administered doses up to 43 mg/kg/day in males and 52 mg/kg/day in females had no increases in tumor incidence, with the exception of a modest increase in the frequency of mammary gland fibroadenomas in female rats receiving doses â‰¥5.4 mg/kg (P&lt;0.015). The highest doses of tamsulosin hydrochloride evaluated in the rat carcinogenicity study produced systemic exposures (AUC) in rats 3 times the exposures in men receiving the maximum therapeutic dose of 0.8 mg/day.</p>
<p>Mice were administered doses up to 127 mg/kg/day in males and 158 mg/kg/day in females. There were no significant tumor findings in male mice. Female mice treated for 2 years with the two highest doses of 45 and 158 mg/kg/day had statistically significant increases in the incidence of mammary gland fibroadenomas (P&lt;0.0001) and adenocarcinomas (P&lt;0.0075). The highest dose levels of tamsulosin hydrochloride evaluated in the mice carcinogenicity study produced systemic exposures (AUC) in mice 8 times the exposures in men receiving the maximum therapeutic dose of 0.8 mg/day.</p>
<p>The increased incidences of mammary gland neoplasms in female rats and mice were considered secondary to tamsulosin hydrochloride-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030186" conceptname="Hyperprolactinemia">hyperprolactinemia</span>. It is not known if tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP elevate prolactin in humans. The relevance for human risk of the findings of prolactin-mediated endocrine tumors in rodents is not known.</p>
<p>Tamsulosin hydrochloride produced no evidence of mutagenic potential <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> in the Ames reverse mutation test, mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> thymidine kinase assay, unscheduled DNA repair synthesis assay, and chromosomal aberration assays in Chinese hamster ovary cells or human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span>. There were no mutagenic effects in the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> sister chromatid exchange and mouse micronucleus assay.</p>
<p>Studies in rats revealed significantly reduced fertility in males dosed with single or multiple daily doses of 300 mg/kg/day of tamsulosin hydrochloride (AUC exposure in rats about 50 times the human exposure with the maximum therapeutic dose). The mechanism of decreased fertility in male rats is considered to be an effect of the compound on the vaginal plug formation possibly due to changes of semen content or impairment of ejaculation. The effects on fertility were reversible showing improvement by 3 days after a single dose and 4 weeks after multiple dosing. Effects on fertility in males were completely reversed within nine weeks of discontinuation of multiple dosing. Multiple doses of 10 and 100 mg/kg/day tamsulosin hydrochloride (1/5 and 16 times the anticipated human AUC exposure) did not significantly alter fertility in male rats. Effects of tamsulosin hydrochloride on sperm counts or sperm function have not been evaluated.</p>
<p>Studies in female rats revealed significant reductions in fertility after single or multiple dosing with 300 mg/kg/day of the R-isomer or racemic mixture of tamsulosin hydrochloride, respectively. In female rats, the reductions in fertility after single doses were considered to be associated with impairments in fertilization. Multiple dosing with 10 or 100 mg/kg/day of the racemic mixture did not significantly alter fertility in female rats.</p>

Patients in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.8 mg once-daily treatment groups received a dose of 0.4 mg once daily for one week before increasing to the 0.8 mg once-daily dose. The primary efficacy assessments included: 1) total American Urological Association (AUA) Symptom Score questionnaire, which evaluated irritative (frequency, urgency, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="40304526" conceptname="Nocturia">nocturia</span>), and obstructive (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201688" conceptname="Delay when starting to pass urine">hesitancy</span>, incomplete emptying, intermittency, and weak stream) symptoms, where a decrease in score is consistent with improvement in symptoms; and 2) peak urine flow rate, where an increased peak urine flow rate value over baseline is consistent with decreased urinary obstruction.</p>
<p>Mean changes from baseline to Week 13 in total AUA Symptom Score were significantly greater for groups treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg and 0.8 mg once daily compared to placebo in both U.S. studies (Table 3, Figures 2A and 2B). The changes from baseline to Week 13 in peak urine flow rate were also significantly greater for the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg and 0.8 mg once-daily groups compared to placebo in Study 1, and for the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.8 mg once-daily group in Study 2 (Table 3, Figures 3A and 3B). Overall there were no significant differences in improvement observed in total AUA Symptom Scores or peak urine flow rates between the 0.4 mg and the 0.8 mg dose groups with the exception that the 0.8 mg dose in Study 1 had a significantly greater improvement in total AUA Symptom Score compared to the 0.4 mg dose.</p>

<p>Week 13: For patients not completing the 13-week study, the last observation was carried forward.</p>
<p>Mean total AUA Symptom Scores for both tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg and 0.8 mg once-daily groups showed a rapid decrease starting at 1 week after dosing and remained decreased through 13 weeks in both studies (Figures 2A and 2B).</p>
<p>In Study 1, 400 patients (53% of the originally randomized group) elected to continue in their originally assigned treatment groups in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 40-week extension trial (138 patients on 0.4 mg, 135 patients on 0.8 mg and 127 patients on placebo). Three hundred twenty-three patients (43% of the originally randomized group) completed one year. Of these, 81% (97 patients) on 0.4 mg, 74% (75 patients) on 0.8 mg and 56% (57 patients) on placebo had a response â‰¥25% above baseline in total AUA Symptom Score at one year.</p>
