Analyses of seventeen placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group.

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">Tardive Dyskinesia</span></h2>
<p class="First"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">Tardive dyskinesia</span>, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with neuroleptic (antipsychotic) drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be the highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of neuroleptic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether neuroleptic drug products differ in their potential to cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> is unknown.</p>
<p>Both the risk of developing the syndrome and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of neuroleptic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.</p>
<p>There is no known treatment for established cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if neuroleptic treatment is withdrawn. Neuroleptic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying disease process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.</p>
<p>Given these considerations, neuroleptics should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>. Chronic neuroleptic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that, 1) is known to respond to neuroleptic drugs, and, 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.</p>
<p>If signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> appear in a patient on neuroleptics, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment despite the presence of the syndrome.</p>
<p>(For further information about the description of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> and its clinical detection, please refer to the sections on <span class="Bold"><a href="#PreIFP">PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients</a> and <a href="#ARTD">ADVERSE REACTIONS, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">Tardive Dyskinesia</span></a></span>.)</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="379802" conceptname="Neuroleptic malignant syndrome">Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome</span> (NMS)</h2>
<p class="First">A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="379802" conceptname="Neuroleptic malignant syndrome">Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome</span> (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260205" conceptname="Hyperpyrexia">hyperpyrexia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4050941" conceptname="Muscle rigidity">muscle rigidity</span>, altered mental status and evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434633" conceptname="Disorder of autonomic nervous system">autonomic instability</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4088122" conceptname="Heart irregular">irregular pulse</span> or blood pressure, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">diaphoresis</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac dysrhythmias</span>).</p>
<p>The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255848" conceptname="Pneumonia">pneumonia</span>, systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4181404" conceptname="Heat stroke">heat stroke</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">drug fever</span> and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.</p>
<p>The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.</p>
<p>If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported. The use of this drug may impair the mental and physical abilities required for driving a car or operating heavy machinery.</p>
<p>Potentiation of the effects of alcohol may occur with the use of this drug.</p>
<p>Since there is no adequate experience in children who have received this drug, safety and efficacy in children have not been established.</p>

<h3>Non-teratogenic Effects</h3>
<p class="First">Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208994" conceptname="Increased muscle tone">hypertonia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">hypotonia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4158346" conceptname="Respiratory distress">respiratory distress</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434750" conceptname="Feeding difficulties and mismanagement">feeding disorder</span> in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity; while in some cases symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization.</p>
<p>Fluphenazine hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<p>The safety for the use of this drug during pregnancy has not been established; therefore, the possible hazards should be weighed against the potential benefits when administering this drug to pregnant patients.</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34072-9">
<a name="section-7.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Because of the possibility of cross-sensitivity, fluphenazine hydrochloride should be used cautiously in patients who have developed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185719" conceptname="Cholestatic jaundice syndrome">cholestatic jaundice</span>, dermatoses or other <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergic reactions</span> to phenothiazine derivatives.   </p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">Psychotic</span> patients on large doses of a phenothiazine drug who are undergoing surgery should be watched carefully for possible hypotensive phenomena. Moreover, it should be remembered that reduced amounts of anesthetics or central nervous system depressants may be necessary.</p>
<p>The effects of atropine may be potentiated in some patients receiving fluphenazine because of added anticholinergic effects.</p>
<p>Fluphenazine hydrochloride should be used cautiously in patients exposed to extreme heat or phosphorous insecticides; in patients with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsive disorders</span>, since <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="374924" conceptname="Generalized convulsive epilepsy">grand mal convulsions</span> have been known to occur; and in patients with special medical disorders such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443962" conceptname="Mitral valve regurgitation">mitral insufficiency</span> or other cardiovascular diseases and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118993" conceptname="Pheochromocytoma">pheochromocytoma</span>.</p>
<p>The possibility of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver damage</span>, pigmentary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="376103" conceptname="Retinopathy">retinopathy</span>, lenticular and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4080669" conceptname="Keratic precipitates">corneal deposits</span>, and development of irreversible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047115" conceptname="Oral dyskinesia">dyskinesia</span> should be remembered when patients are on prolonged therapy.</p>
<p>Neuroleptic drugs elevate prolactin levels; the elevation persists during chronic administration. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with a previously detected breast cancer. Although disturbances such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79884" conceptname="Galactorrhea not associated with childbirth">galactorrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443800" conceptname="Amenorrhea">amenorrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168447" conceptname="Gynecomastia">gynecomastia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">impotence</span> have been reported, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. An increase in mammary neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of neuroleptic drugs. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date, however, have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis; the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time.</p>

<h2>Abrupt Withdrawal</h2>
<p class="First">In general, phenothiazines do not produce psychic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>; however, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201340" conceptname="Gastritis">gastritis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremulousness</span> have been reported following abrupt cessation of high dose therapy.

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-8.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Central Nervous System</h2>
<p class="First">The side effects most frequently reported with phenothiazine compounds are <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373747" conceptname="Extrapyramidal disease">extrapyramidal symptoms</span> including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4140090" conceptname="Parkinsonism">pseudoparkinsonism</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375800" conceptname="Dystonia">dystonia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047115" conceptname="Oral dyskinesia">dyskinesia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4108925" conceptname="Akathisia">akathisia</span>, oculogyric crises, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4313849" conceptname="Opisthotonus">opisthotonos</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4313132" conceptname="Hyperreflexia">hyperreflexia</span>. Most often these <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373747" conceptname="Extrapyramidal disease">extrapyramidal symptoms</span> are reversible; however, they may be persistent (see below). With any given phenothiazine derivative, the incidence and severity of such reactions depend more on individual patient sensitivity than on other factors, but dosage level and patient age are also determinants.</p>
<p>Symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375800" conceptname="Dystonia">dystonia</span>, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">difficulty breathing</span>, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375800" conceptname="Dystonia">acute dystonia</span> is observed in males and younger age groups.</p>
<p>Extrapyramidal reactions may be alarming, and the patient should be forewarned and reassured. These reactions can usually be controlled by administration of antiparkinsonian drugs such as Benztropine Mesylate or Intravenous Caffeine and Sodium Benzoate Injection, and by subsequent reduction in dosage.</p>

<p class="First">See <span class="Bold"><a href="#WARNINGS">WARNINGS</a></span>. The syndrome is characterized by involuntary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4181630" conceptname="Choreoathetosis">choreoathetoid movements</span> which variously involve the tongue, face, mouth, lips, or jaw (e.g., protrusion of the tongue, puffing of cheeks, puckering of the mouth, chewing movements), trunk and extremities. The severity of the syndrome and the degree of impairment produced vary widely.</p>
<p>The syndrome may become clinically recognizable either during treatment, upon dosage reduction, or upon withdrawal of treatment. Early detection of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> is important. To increase the likelihood of detecting the syndrome at the earliest possible time, the dosage of neuroleptic drug should be reduced periodically (if clinically possible) and the patient observed for signs of the disorder. This maneuver is critical, since neuroleptic drugs may mask the signs of the syndrome.</p>

If severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> should occur, supportive measures including the use of intravenous vasopressor drugs should be instituted immediately. Levarterenol Bitartrate Injection is the most suitable drug for this purpose; epinephrine should not be used since phenothiazine derivatives have been found to reverse its action, resulting in a further lowering of blood pressure.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Depending on the severity and duration of symptoms, total daily dosage for<span class="Italics"> adult</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychotic</span> patients may range initially from 2.5 to 10 mg and should be divided and given at six- to eight- hour intervals.</p>
<p>The smallest amount that will produce the desired results must be carefully determined for each individual, since optimal dosage levels of this potent drug may vary from patient to patient. In general, the oral dose has been found to be approximately two to three times the parenteral dose of fluphenazine. Treatment is best instituted with a low initial dosage, which may be increased, if necessary, until the desired clinical effects are achieved. Therapeutic effect is often achieved with doses under 20 mg daily. Patients remaining severely disturbed or inadequately controlled may require upward titration of dosage. Daily doses up to 40 mg may be necessary; controlled clinical studies have not been performed to demonstrate safety of prolonged administration of such doses.</p>
<p>When symptoms are controlled, dosage can generally be reduced gradually to daily maintenance doses of 1 to 5 mg, often given as a single daily dose. Continued treatment is needed to achieve maximum therapeutic benefits; further adjustments in dosage may be necessary during the course of therapy to meet the patient's requirements.</p>
<p>For <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychotic</span> patients who have been stabilized on a fixed daily dosage of orally administered Fluphenazine Hydrochloride dosage forms, conversion to the long-acting injectable Fluphenazine Decanoate may be indicated [see package insert for Fluphenazine Decanoate Injection for conversion information].</p>
<p>For <span class="Italics">geriatric</span> patients, the suggested starting dose is 1 to 2.5 mg daily, adjusted according to the response of the patient.</p>
<p>When the Oral Concentrate dosage form is to be used, the desired dose (measured by a calibrated device only) should be added to at least 60 mL (2 fl oz) of a suitable diluent <span class="Italics">just prior to administration</span> to ensure palatability and stability. Suggested diluents include tomato or fruit juice, milk, and uncaffeinated soft drinks. The Oral Concentrate should not be mixed with beverages containing caffeine (coffee, cola), tannics (tea), or pectinates (apple juice) because of the potential incompatibility.</p>
<p>Fluphenazine Hydrochloride Injection USP is useful when <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychotic</span> patients are unable or unwilling to take oral therapy.</p>
