<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Mitomycin (also known as mitomycin and/or mitomycin-C) is an antibiotic isolated from the broth of Streptomyces caespitosus which has been shown to have antitumor activity. The compound is heat stable, has a high melting point, and is freely soluble in organic solvents.</p>
<p>Mitomycin for Injection is a sterile dry mixture of mitomycin and mannitol, which when reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection provides a solution for intravenous administration. Each vial contains either mitomycin 5 mg and mannitol 10 mg, or mitomycin 20 mg and mannitol 40 mg, or mitomycin 40 mg and mannitol 80 mg. Each mL of reconstituted solution will contain 0.5 mg mitomycin and have a pH between 6.0 and 8.0.</p>
<p>Mitomycin is a blue-violet crystalline powder with the molecular formula of C<span class="Sub">15</span>H<span class="Sub">18</span>N<span class="Sub">4</span>O<span class="Sub">5</span>, and a molecular weight of 334.33. Its chemical name is 7-amino-9α-methoxymitosane and it has the following structural formula;</p>
<p></p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Mitomycin selectively inhibits the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The guanine and cytosine content correlates with the degree of mitomycin-induced cross-linking. At high concentrations of the drug, cellular RNA and protein synthesis are also suppressed. </p>
<p>In humans, mitomycin is rapidly cleared from the serum after intravenous administration. Time required to reduce the serum concentration by 50% after a 30 mg bolus injection is 17 minutes. After injection of 30 mg, 20 mg, or 10 mg I.V., the maximal serum concentrations were 2.4 mcg/mL, 1.7 mcg/mL, and 0.52 mcg/mL, respectively. Clearance is effected primarily by metabolism in the liver, but metabolism occurs in other tissues as well. The rate of clearance is inversely proportional to the maximal serum concentration because, it is thought, of saturation of the degradative pathways.</p>
<p>Approximately 10% of a dose of mitomycin is excreted unchanged in the urine. Since metabolic pathways are saturated at relatively low doses, the percent of a dose excreted in urine increases with increasing dose. In children, excretion of intravenously administered mitomycin is similar.</p>

<h2>Animal Toxicology</h2>
<p class="First">Mitomycin has been found to be carcinogenic in rats and mice. At doses approximating the recommended clinical dose in man, it produces a greater than 100 percent increase in tumor incidence in male Sprague-Dawley rats, and a greater than 50 percent increase in tumor incidence in female Swiss mice.</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Mitomycin for Injection is not recommended as single-agent, primary therapy. It has been shown to be useful in the therapy of disseminated adenocarcinoma of the stomach or pancreas in proven combinations with other approved chemotherapeutic agents and as palliative treatment when other modalities have failed. Mitomycin is not recommended to replace appropriate surgery and/or radiotherapy.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34070-3">
<a name="section-5"></a><p></p>
<h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Mitomycin is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated a hypersensitive or idiosyncratic reaction to it in the past.</p>
<p>Mitomycin is contraindicated in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432585" conceptname="Blood coagulation disorder">coagulation disorder</span>, or an increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432585" conceptname="Blood coagulation disorder">bleeding tendency</span> due to other causes.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First">Patients being treated with mitomycin must be observed carefully and frequently during and after therapy.</p>
<p>The use of mitomycin results in a high incidence of bone marrow suppression, particularly <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435224" conceptname="Leukopenia">leukopenia</span>. Therefore, the following studies should be obtained repeatedly during therapy and for at least eight weeks following therapy: platelet count, white blood cell count, differential, and hemoglobin. The occurrence of a platelet count below 100,000/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> or a WBC below 4,000/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> or a progressive decline in either is an indication to withhold further therapy until blood counts have recovered above these levels.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised of the potential toxicity of this drug, particularly bone marrow suppression. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Deaths</span> have been reported due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="132797" conceptname="Sepsis">septicemia</span> as a result of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435224" conceptname="Leukopenia">leukopenia</span> due to the drug.</p>
<p>Patients receiving mitomycin should be observed for evidence of renal toxicity. Mitomycin should not be given to patients with a serum creatinine greater than 1.7 mg percent.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42228-7">
<a name="section-6.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Usage in Pregnancy</h2>
<p class="First">Safe use of mitomycin in pregnant women has not been established. Teratological changes have been noted in animal studies. The effect of mitomycin on fertility is unknown.</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">shortness of breath</span> and severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256717" conceptname="Bronchospasm">bronchospasm</span> have been reported following the administration of vinca alkaloids in patients who had previously or simultaneously received mitomycin. The onset of this acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4158346" conceptname="Respiratory distress">respiratory distress</span> occurred within minutes to hours after the vinca alkaloid injection. The total number of doses for each drug has varied considerably. Bronchodilators, steroids and/or oxygen have produced symptomatic relief. </p>
<p>A few cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4195694" conceptname="Adult respiratory distress syndrome">adult respiratory distress syndrome</span> have been reported in patients receiving mitomycin in combination with other chemotherapy and maintained at FlO<span class="Sub">2</span> concentrations greater than 50% perioperatively. Therefore, caution should be exercised using only enough oxygen to provide adequate arterial saturation since oxygen itself is toxic to the lungs. Careful attention should be paid to fluid balance and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4266976" conceptname="Overhydration">overhydration</span> should be avoided.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4318846" conceptname="Fibrosis of urinary bladder">Bladder fibrosis</span>/contraction has been reported with intravesical administration (not an approved route of administration), which in rare cases has required cystectomy.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34080-2">
<a name="section-7.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">It is not known if mitomycin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious
adverse reactions in nursing infants from mitomycin, it is recommended that nursing be discontinued when receiving mitomycin therapy.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34081-0">

<a name="geriatric"></a><a name="section-8"></a><p></p>
<h1>Geriatric Use</h1>
<p class="First">Insufficient data from clinical studies of mitomycin are available for patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Postmarketing surveillance suggests that elderly patients may be more susceptible than younger patients to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4316202" conceptname="Injection site reaction">injection site reactions</span> (see <a href="#adverse">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a>: <a href="http://mucous">Integument and Mucous Membrane Toxicity</a>) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span>. In general, caution should be exercised when prescribing to elderly patients, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.</p>
<p>Mitomycin should be given intravenously only, using care to avoid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4295895" conceptname="Extravasation">extravasation</span> of the compound. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4295895" conceptname="Extravasation">extravasation</span> occurs, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435613" conceptname="Cellulitis">cellulitis</span>, ulceration, and slough may result.</p>
<p>Each vial contains mitomycin 5 mg and mannitol 10 mg. To administer, add Sterile Water for Injection, 10 mL. Shake to dissolve. If product does not dissolve immediately, allow to stand at room temperature until solution is obtained.</p>
<p>After full hematological recovery (see guide to dosage adjustment) from any previous chemotherapy, the following dosage schedule may be used at 6 to 8 week intervals:</p>
<p>20 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> intravenously as a single dose via a functioning intravenous catheter.</p>
<p>Because of cumulative <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4145241" conceptname="Bone marrow depression">myelosuppression</span>, patients should be fully reevaluated after each course of mitomycin, and the dose reduced if the patient has experienced any toxicities. Doses greater than 20 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> have not been shown to be more effective, and are more toxic than lower doses.</p>
