<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Fioricet with Codeine is a combination drug product intended as a treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="376382" conceptname="Tension-type headache">tension headache</span>. It consists of a fixed combination of butalbital 50 mg, acetaminophen 300 mg, caffeine 40 mg, and codeine phosphate 30 mg. The role each component plays in the relief of the complex of symptoms known as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="376382" conceptname="Tension-type headache">tension headache</span> is incompletely understood.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">The behavior of the individual components is described below.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="i4i_section_id_a5b74ba9-e527-43bb-ae4f-fa7c3b03395b"></a><a name="section-2.1.1"></a><p></p>
<h3><span class="Bold">Butalbital</span></h3>
<p class="First">Butalbital is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is expected to distribute to most tissues in the body. Barbiturates in general may appear in breast milk and readily cross the placental barrier. They are bound to plasma and tissue proteins to a varying degree and binding increases directly as a function of lipid solubility.</p>
<p>Elimination of butalbital is primarily via the kidney (59% to 88% of the dose) as unchanged drug or metabolites. The plasma half-life is about 35 hours. Urinary excretion products include parent drug (about 3.6% of the dose), 5isobutyl5(2,3dihydroxypropyl) barbituric acid (about 24% of the dose), 5allyl5(3-hydroxy2methyl1propyl) barbituric acid (about 4.8% of the dose), products with the barbituric acid ring hydrolyzed with excretion of urea (about 14% of the dose), as well as unidentified materials. Of the material excreted in the urine, 32% is conjugated.</p>
<p>The <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> plasma protein binding of butalbital is 45% over the concentration range of 0.5 to 20 mcg/mL. This <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falls</span> within the range of plasma protein binding (20% to 45%) reported with other barbiturates such as phenobarbital, pentobarbital, and secobarbital sodium. The plasma-to-blood concentration ratio was almost unity indicating that there is no preferential distribution of butalbital into either plasma or blood cells.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">See OVERDOSAGE </span>for toxicity  information.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold">Acetaminophen</span></h3>
<p class="First">Acetaminophen is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is distributed throughout most body tissues. The plasma half-life is 1.25 to 3 hours, but may be increased by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver damage</span> and following overdosage. Elimination of acetaminophen is principally by liver metabolism (conjugation) and subsequent renal excretion of metabolites. Approximately 85% of an oral dose appears in the urine within 24 hours of administration, most as the glucuronide conjugate, with small amounts of other conjugates and unchanged drug.</p>
<p>See <span class="Italics"><a href="#i4i_overdosage_id_804fbb8e-19c5-47ef-9e79-da9e23c76230">OVERDOSAGE</a></span>for toxicity  information.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold">Caffeine</span></h3>
<p class="First">Like most xanthines, caffeine is rapidly absorbed and distributed in all body tissues and fluids, including the CNS, fetal tissues, and breast milk.</p>
<p>Caffeine is cleared through metabolism and excretion in the urine. The plasma half-life is about 3 hours. Hepatic biotransformation prior to excretion results in about equal amounts of 1methylxanthine and 1methyluric acid. Of the 70% of the dose that is recovered in the urine, only 3% is unchanged drug.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">See <a href="#i4i_overdosage_id_804fbb8e-19c5-47ef-9e79-da9e23c76230">OVERDOSAGE</a></span>for toxicity  information.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold">Codeine</span></h3>
<p class="First">Codeine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is rapidly distributed from the intravascular spaces to the various body tissues, with preferential uptake by parenchymatous organs such as the liver, spleen and kidney. Codeine crosses the blood-brain barrier, and is found in fetal tissue and breast milk. The plasma concentration does not correlate with brain concentration or relief of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>; however, codeine is not bound to plasma proteins and does not accumulate in body tissues.</p>
<p>The plasma half-life is about 2.9 hours. The elimination of codeine is primarily via the kidneys, and about 90% of an oral dose is excreted by the kidneys within 24 hours of dosing. The urinary secretion products consist of free and glucuronide conjugated codeine (about 70%), free and conjugated norcodeine (about 10%), free and conjugated morphine (about 10%), normorphine (4%), and hydrocodone (1%). The remainder of the dose is excreted in the feces.</p>
<p>At therapeutic doses, the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span> reaches a peak within 2 hours and persists between 4 and 6 hours.</p>

<h2>Hepatotoxicity</h2>
<p class="First">Fioricet with Codeine contains butalbital, acetaminophen, caffeine, and codeine phosphate.  Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4026032" conceptname="Acute hepatic failure">acute liver failure</span>, at times resulting in liver transplant and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. Most of the cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver injury</span> are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product. The excessive intake of acetaminophen may be intentional to cause self-harm or unintentional as patients attempt to obtain more <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relief or unknowingly take other acetaminophen-containing products.</p>
<p>The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4026032" conceptname="Acute hepatic failure">acute liver failure</span> is higher in individuals with underlying liver disease and in individuals who ingest alcohol while taking acetaminophen.</p>
<p>Instruct patients to look for acetaminophen or APAP on package labels and not to use more than one product that contains acetaminophen. Instruct patients to seek medical attention immediately upon ingestion of more than 4000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day, even if they feel well.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Death</span> Related to Ultra-Rapid Metabolism of Codeine to Morphine</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">Respiratory depression</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> have occurred in children who received codeine in the post-operative period following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy and had evidence of being ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine (i.e., multiple copies of the gene for cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2D6 or high morphine concentrations). <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Deaths</span> have also occurred in nursing infants who were exposed to high levels of morphine in breast milk because their mothers were ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine. </p>
<p>Some individuals may be ultra-rapid metabolizers because of a specific CYP2D6 genotype (gene duplications denoted as *1/*1xN or *1/*2xN). The prevalence of this CYP2D6 phenotype varies widely and has been estimated at 0.5 to 1% in Chinese and Japanese, 0.5 to 1% in Hispanics, 1 to 10% in Caucasians, 3% in African Americans, and 16 to 28% in North Africans, Ethiopians, and Arabs. Data are not available for other ethnic groups. These individuals convert codeine into its active metabolite, morphine, more rapidly and completely than other people. This rapid conversion results in higher than expected serum morphine levels. Even at labeled dosage regimens, individuals who are ultra-rapid metabolizers may have life-threatening or fatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> or experience signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> (such as extreme <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302536" conceptname="Shallow breathing">shallow breathing</span>). </p>

<h3><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Nursing Mothers</span></span></h3>
<p class="First">Codeine is secreted into human milk. In women with normal codeine metabolism (normal CYP2D6 activity), the amount of codeine secreted into human milk is low and dose-dependent. Despite the common use of codeine products to manage postpartum <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, reports of adverse events in infants are rare. However, some women are ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine. These women achieve higher than-expected serum levels of codeine's active metabolite, morphine, leading to higher-than-expected levels of morphine in breast milk and potentially dangerously high serum morphine levels in their breastfed infants. Therefore, maternal use of codeine can potentially lead to serious adverse reactions, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>, in nursing infants.</p>
<p>The risk of infant exposure to codeine and morphine through breast milk should be weighed against the benefits of breastfeeding for both the mother and baby. Caution should be exercised when codeine is administered to a nursing woman. If a codeine containing product is selected, the lowest dose should be prescribed for the shortest period of time to achieve the desired clinical effect. Mothers using codeine should be informed about when to seek immediate medical care and how to identify the signs and symptoms of neonatal toxicity, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> or sedation, difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, and decreased tone, in their baby. Nursing mothers who are ultra-rapid metabolizers may also experience <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> symptoms such as extreme <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302536" conceptname="Shallow breathing">shallow breathing</span>. Prescribers should closely monitor mother-infant pairs and notify treating pediatricians about the use of codeine during breastfeeding. (See WARNINGS — <a href="#i4i_warnings_id_3ba28088-2c50-4947-a1b7-3d95996dc43d"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Death</span> Related to Ultra-Rapid Metabolism of Codeine to Morphine</a>.)</p>
<p>Barbiturates, acetaminophen, and caffeine are also excreted in breast milk in small amounts. Because of potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Fioricet with Codeine , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<h2>Geriatric use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of Butalbital, Acetaminophen, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>
<p>Butalbital is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Butalbital </span></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Barbiturates may be habit-forming:</span></span> Tolerance, psychological <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>, and physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> may occur especially following prolonged use of high doses of barbiturates. The average daily dose for the barbiturate addict is usually about 1,500 mg. As tolerance to barbiturates develops, the amount needed to maintain the same level of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> increases; tolerance to a fatal dosage, however, does not increase more than twofold. As this occurs, the margin between an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> dosage and fatal dosage becomes smaller. The lethal dose of a barbiturate is far less if alcohol is also ingested. Major withdrawal symptoms (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373995" conceptname="Delirium">delirium</span>) may occur within 16 hours and last up to 5 days after abrupt cessation of these drugs. Intensity of withdrawal symptoms gradually declines over a period of approximately 15 days. Treatment of barbiturate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> consists of cautious and gradual withdrawal of the drug. Barbiturate-dependent patients can be withdrawn by using a number of different withdrawal regimens. One method involves initiating treatment at the patient's regular dosage level and gradually decreasing the daily dosage as tolerated by the patient.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Codeine</span></span></p>
<p>Codeine can produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">drug dependence</span> of the morphine type and, therefore, has the potential for being abused.

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Following an acute overdosage of Fioricet with Codeine, toxicity may result from the barbiturate, the codeine, or the acetaminophen. Toxicity due to the caffeine is less likely, due to the relatively small amounts in this formulation.</p>

<h2>Treatment</h2>
<p class="First">A single or multiple drug <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> with Fioricet with Codeine  is a potentially lethal polydrug <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, and consultation with a regional poison control center is recommended. Immediate treatment includes support of cardiorespiratory function and measures to reduce drug absorption. Oxygen, intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and other supportive measures should be employed as indicated. Assisted or controlled ventilation should also be considered. For <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> due to overdosage or unusual sensitivity to codeine, parenteral naloxone is a specific and effective antagonist. </p>
<p>Gastric decontamination with activated charcoal should be administered just prior to N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to decrease systemic absorption if acetaminophen ingestion is known or suspected to have occurred within a few hours of presentation. Serum acetaminophen levels should be obtained immediately if the patient presents 4 hours or more after ingestion to assess potential risk of hepatotoxicity; acetaminophen levels drawn less than 4 hours post-ingestion may be misleading. To obtain the best possible outcome, NAC should be administered as soon as possible where impending or evolving <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver injury</span> is suspected. Intravenous NAC may be administered when circumstances preclude oral administration.</p>
<p>Vigorous supportive therapy is required in severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>. Procedures to limit the continuing absorption of the drug must be readily performed since the hepatic injury is dose dependent and occurs early in the course of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>.</p>
