<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Kenalog<span class="Sup">Â®</span>-10 Injection (triamcinolone
acetonide injectable suspension, USP) is triamcinolone acetonide, a synthetic
glucocorticoid corticosteroid with marked anti-inflammatory action, in a sterile
aqueous suspension suitable for intralesional and intra-articular injection.
THIS FORMULATION IS SUITABLE FOR INTRA-ARTICULAR AND INTRALESIONAL USE ONLY.</p>
<p>Each mL of the sterile aqueous suspension provides 10 mg triamcinolone
acetonide, with sodium chloride for isotonicity, 0.9% (w/v) benzyl alcohol
as a preservative, 0.75% carboxymethylcellulose sodium, and 0.04% polysorbate
80; sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid may have been added to adjust pH
between 5.0 and 7.5. At the time of manufacture, the air in the container
is replaced by nitrogen.</p>
<p>The chemical name for triamcinolone acetonide is 9-Fluoro-11Î²,16Î±,17,21-tetrahydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione
cyclic 16,17-acetal with acetone. Its structural formula is:</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Glucocorticoids, naturally occurring and synthetic, are adrenocortical
steroids that are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
<p>Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone),
which also have salt-retaining properties, are used as replacement therapy
in adrenocortical deficiency states. Synthetic analogs such as triamcinolone
are primarily used for their anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many
organ systems.</p>

<a name="s6.1"></a><a name="section-6.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Exposure to excessive amounts of benzyl alcohol has been associated
with toxicity (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span>), particularly in neonates,
and an increased incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4326231" conceptname="Kernicterus">kernicterus</span>, particularly in small preterm infants.
There have been rare reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span>, primarily in preterm infants, associated
with exposure to excessive amounts of benzyl alcohol. The amount of benzyl
alcohol from medications is usually considered negligible compared to that
received in flush solutions containing benzyl alcohol. Administration of high
dosages of medications containing this preservative must take into account
the total amount of benzyl alcohol administered. The amount of benzyl alcohol
at which toxicity may occur is not known. If the patient requires more than
the recommended dosages or other medications containing this preservative,
the practitioner must consider the daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol
from these combined sources (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s7.14">PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric
Use</a></span>).</p>
<p>Because Kenalog-10 Injection (triamcinolone acetonide injectable
suspension, USP) is a suspension, it should <span class="Italics">not</span> be administered
intravenously. Strict aseptic technique is mandatory.</p>
<p>Rare instances of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4148381" conceptname="Anaphylactoid reaction">anaphylactoid reactions</span> have occurred in patients
receiving corticosteroid therapy (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s8">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span>). Cases of serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylactic reactions</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylactic shock</span>, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>, have been reported in individuals receiving triamcinolone acetonide injection, regardless of the route of administration.</p>
<p>Increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids is indicated
in patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to any unusual stress before,
during, and after the stressful situation.</p>
<p>Kenalog-10 Injection is a long-acting preparation, and is <span class="Italics">not</span> suitable for
use in acute stress situations.</p>
<p>Results from one multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study with methylprednisolone hemisuccinate, an intravenous corticosteroid, showed an increase in early (at 2 weeks) and late (at 6 months) mortality in patients with cranial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433633" conceptname="Late effect of superficial injury">trauma</span> who were determined not to have other clear indications for corticosteroid treatment. High doses of systemic corticosteroids, including Kenalog-10 Injection, should not be used for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437409" conceptname="Intracranial injury">traumatic brain injury</span>.</p>

<h2>Cardio-Renal</h2>
<p class="First">Average and large doses of corticosteroids can cause elevation
of blood pressure, salt and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4125002" conceptname="Idiopathic fluid retention">water retention</span>, and increased excretion of potassium.
These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except
when they are used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium
supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion.</p>

of corticosteroids and left ventricular free wall rupture after a recent myocardial
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4206471" conceptname="Infarct">infarction</span>; therefore, therapy with corticosteroids should be used with great
caution in these patients.</p>

<h2>Musculoskeletal</h2>
<p class="First">Corticosteroids decrease bone formation and increase bone resorption
both through their effect on calcium regulation (ie, decreasing absorption
and increasing excretion) and inhibition of osteoblast function. This, together
with a decrease in the protein matrix of the bone secondary to an increase
in protein catabolism, and reduced sex hormone production, may lead to inhibition

<h2>Neuro-Psychiatric</h2>
<p class="First">Although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids
to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple
sclerosis, they do not show that they affect the ultimate outcome or natural
history of the disease. The studies do show that relatively high doses of
corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#s10">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>.)</p>
<p>An <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4102023" conceptname="Proximal myopathy">acute myopathy</span> has been observed with the use of high doses

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Aminoglutethimide:</span> Aminoglutethimide may lead
to a loss of corticosteroid-induced adrenal suppression.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Amphotericin B injection and potassium-depleting agents:</span> When
corticosteroids are administered concomitantly with potassium-depleting agents
(ie, amphotericin B, diuretics), patients should be observed closely for development
of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>. There have been cases reported in which concomitant use of
amphotericin B and hydrocortisone was followed by cardiac enlargement and
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Antibiotics:</span> Macrolide antibiotics have been reported
to cause a significant decrease in corticosteroid clearance.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Anticholinesterases:</span> Concomitant use of anticholinesterase
agents and corticosteroids may produce severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">weakness</span> in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79908" conceptname="Muscle weakness">myasthenia</span>
gravis. If possible, anticholinesterase agents should be withdrawn at least
24 hours before initiating corticosteroid therapy.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Anticoagulants, oral:</span> Coadministration of corticosteroids
and warfarin usually results in inhibition of response to warfarin, although
there have been some conflicting reports. Therefore, coagulation indices should
be monitored frequently to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Antidiabetics:</span> Because corticosteroids may increase
blood glucose concentrations, dosage adjustments of antidiabetic agents may
be required.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Antitubercular drugs:</span> Serum concentrations of
isoniazid may be decreased.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Cholestyramine:</span> Cholestyramine may increase the
clearance of corticosteroids.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Cyclosporine:</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">Increased activity</span> of both cyclosporine
and corticosteroids may occur when the two are used concurrently. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">Convulsions</span>
have been reported with this concurrent use.</p>

<p><span class="Italics">Estrogens, including oral contraceptives:</span> Estrogens
may decrease the hepatic metabolism of certain corticosteroids, thereby increasing
their effect.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Hepatic enzyme inducers (eg, barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepine,
rifampin):</span> Drugs which induce hepatic microsomal drug metabolizing
enzyme activity may enhance the metabolism of corticosteroids and require
that the dosage of the corticosteroid be increased.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Ketoconazole:</span> Ketoconazole has been reported to
decrease the metabolism of certain corticosteroids by up to 60%, leading to
an increased risk of corticosteroid side effects.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs):</span> Concomitant
use of aspirin (or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and corticosteroids
increases the risk of gastrointestinal side effects. Aspirin should be used
cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4253058" conceptname="Factor II deficiency">hypoprothrombinemia</span>. The
clearance of salicylates may be increased with concurrent use of corticosteroids.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Skin tests:</span> Corticosteroids may suppress reactions
to skin tests.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Vaccines:</span> Patients on prolonged corticosteroid
therapy may exhibit a diminished response to toxoids and live or inactivated
vaccines due to inhibition of antibody response. Corticosteroids may also
potentiate the replication of some organisms contained in live attenuated
vaccines. Routine administration of vaccines or toxoids should be deferred
until corticosteroid therapy is discontinued if possible (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s6.5.5">WARNINGS: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">Infections</span>: Vaccination</a></span>).</p>

<h3>Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C</h3>
<p class="First">Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in many species
when given in doses equivalent to the human dose. Animal studies in which

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">This product contains benzyl alcohol as a preservative. Benzyl
alcohol, a component of this product, has been associated with serious adverse
events and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>, particularly in pediatric patients. The â€œgasping syndromeâ€?
(characterized by central nervous system <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245042" conceptname="Metabolic acidosis">metabolic acidosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">gasping</span>
respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites found
in the blood and urine) has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages &gt;99
mg/kg/day in neonates and low-birth-weight neonates. Additional symptoms may
include gradual neurological deterioration, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439847" conceptname="Intracranial hemorrhage">intracranial hemorrhage</span>,

of this product deliver amounts of benzyl alcohol that are substantially lower
than those reported in association with the â€œgasping syndrome,â€? the minimum
amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Premature
and low-birth-weight infants, as well as patients receiving high dosages,
may be more likely to develop toxicity. Practitioners administering this and
other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily
metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources.</p>
<p>The efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in the pediatric population
are based on the well-established course of effect of corticosteroids which
is similar in pediatric and adult populations. Published studies provide evidence
of efficacy and safety in pediatric patients for the treatment of nephrotic
syndrome (&gt;2 years of age), and aggressive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphomas</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315497" conceptname="Subacute leukemia">leukemias</span> (&gt;1 month
of age). Other indications for pediatric use of corticosteroids, eg, severe
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314754" conceptname="Wheezing">wheezing</span>, are based on adequate and well-controlled trials conducted
in adults, on the premises that the course of the diseases and their pathophysiology
are considered to be substantially similar in both populations.</p>
<p>The adverse effects of corticosteroids in pediatric patients are
similar to those in adults (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s8">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span>).
Like adults, pediatric patients should be carefully observed with frequent
measurements of blood pressure, weight, height, intraocular pressure, and
clinical evaluation for the presence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, psychosocial disturbances,
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4159647" conceptname="Thromboembolic disorder">thromboembolism</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4027663" conceptname="Peptic ulcer">peptic ulcers</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">cataracts</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span>. Pediatric patients
who are treated with corticosteroids by any route, including systemically
administered corticosteroids, may experience a decrease in their growth velocity.
This negative impact of corticosteroids on growth has been observed at low
systemic doses and in the absence of laboratory evidence of HPA axis suppression
(ie, cosyntropin stimulation and basal cortisol plasma levels). Growth velocity
may therefore be a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure
in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function.
The linear growth of pediatric patients treated with corticosteroids should
be monitored, and the potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should
be weighed against clinical benefits obtained and the availability of treatment
alternatives. In order to minimize the potential growth effects of corticosteroids,
pediatric patients should be <span class="Italics">titrated</span> to the lowest effective
dose.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Treatment of acute overdosage is by supportive and symptomatic
therapy. For chronic overdosage in the face of severe disease requiring continuous
steroid therapy, the dosage of the corticosteroid may be reduced only temporarily,
or alternate day treatment may be introduced.</p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s10.1"></a><a name="section-10.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">NOTE: CONTAINS BENZYL ALCOHOL (see <a href="#Pre">PRECAUTIONS</a>).</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE
AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND
THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT.</span> After a favorable response is noted, the
proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug
dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest
dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. Situations
which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status
secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patientâ€™s
individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful
situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In
this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the corticosteroid
for a period of time consistent with the patientâ€™s condition. If after long-term
therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn
gradually rather than abruptly. </p>
<p>In pediatric patients, the initial dose of triamcinolone may vary
depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial
doses is 0.11 to 1.6 mg/kg/day in 3 or 4 divided doses (3.2 to
48 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>bsa/day).</p>

<h2>Intra-Articular Administration</h2>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s10.2.1"></a><a name="section-10.2.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Dosage</h3>
<p class="First">The initial dose of Kenalog-10 Injection for intra-articular administration may vary from
2.5 mg to 5 mg for smaller joints and from 5 mg to 15 mg for larger joints, depending
on the specific disease entity being treated. Single injections into several
joints, up to a total of 20 mg or more, have been given.</p>

<a name="s10.3"></a><a name="section-10.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Intralesional</h2>
<p class="First">For intralesional administration, the initial dose per injection
site will vary depending on the specific disease entity and lesion being treated.
The site of injection and volume of injection should be carefully considered
due to the potential for cutaneous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4028206" conceptname="Atrophy">atrophy</span>.</p>
<p>Multiple sites separated by one centimeter or more may be injected,
keeping in mind that the greater the <span class="Italics">total</span> volume employed
the more corticosteroid becomes available for systemic absorption and systemic
effects. Such injections may be repeated, if necessary, at weekly or less
frequent intervals.</p>

<a name="s10.4"></a><a name="section-10.4"></a><p></p>
<h2>Localization of Doses</h2>
<p class="First">The lower dosages in the initial dosage range of triamcinolone
acetonide may produce the desired effect when the corticosteroid is administered
to provide a localized concentration. The site and volume of the injection
should be carefully considered when triamcinolone acetonide is administered
for this purpose.</p>

<a name="s10.5"></a><a name="section-10.5"></a><p></p>
<h2>Administration</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">STRICT ASEPTIC TECHNIQUE IS MANDATORY.</span> The vial should
be shaken before use to ensure a uniform suspension. Prior to withdrawal,
the suspension should be inspected for clumping or granular appearance
(agglomeration). An agglomerated product results from exposure to freezing
temperatures and should not be used. After withdrawal, inject without delay
to prevent settling in the syringe.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s10.5.1"></a><a name="section-10.5.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Injection Technique</h3>
<p class="First">For treatment of joints, the usual intra-articular injection technique
should be followed. If an excessive amount of synovial fluid is present in
the joint, some, but not all, should be aspirated to aid in the relief of
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> and to prevent undue dilution of the steroid.</p>
<p>With intra-articular administration, prior use of a local anesthetic
may often be desirable. Care should be taken with this kind of injection,
particularly in the deltoid region, to avoid injecting the suspension into
the tissues surrounding the site, since this may lead to tissue <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4028206" conceptname="Atrophy">atrophy</span>.</p>
<p>In treating acute nonspecific <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4195698" conceptname="Tenosynovitis">tenosynovitis</span>, care should be taken
to ensure that the injection of Kenalog-10 Injection is made into the tendon sheath rather than the
tendon substance. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4249170" conceptname="Epicondylitis">Epicondylitis</span> may be treated by infiltrating the preparation

<a name="s10.5.2"></a><a name="section-10.5.2"></a><p></p>
<h3>Intralesional</h3>
<p class="First">For treatment of dermal lesions, Kenalog-10 Injection should be injected directly into the
lesion, ie, intradermally or subcutaneously. For accuracy of
dosage measurement and ease of administration, it is preferable to employ
a tuberculin syringe and a small-bore needle (23-25 gauge). Ethyl chloride
spray may be used to alleviate the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090431" conceptname="Discomfort">discomfort</span> of the injection.</p>
