Waiting less than 30 minutes, or taking alendronate with food, beverages (other than plain water) or other medications will lessen the effect of alendronate by decreasing its absorption into the body.</p>
<p>Alendronate should only be taken upon arising for the day. To facilitate gastric emptying alendronate oral solution should be followed by at least 2 oz (a quarter of a cup) of water. Patients should not lie down for at least 30 minutes <span class="Underline">and</span> until after their first food of the day. Alendronate should not be taken at bedtime or before arising for the day. Failure to follow these instructions may increase the risk of esophageal adverse experiences [<span class="Italics">see<a href="#S5.1"> Warnings and Precautions (5.1) </a></span>and<span class="Italics"><a href="#S17.2"> Patient Counseling Information (17.2)</a></span>].</p>

Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when alendronate is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett's esophagus, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31317" conceptname="Dysphagia">dysphagia</span>, other esophageal diseases, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201340" conceptname="Gastritis">gastritis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433516" conceptname="Duodenitis">duodenitis</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcers</span>).</p>
<p>Esophageal adverse experiences, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="30753" conceptname="Esophagitis">esophagitis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="25844" conceptname="Ulcer of esophagus">esophageal ulcers</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4024833" conceptname="Esophageal erosions">esophageal erosions</span>, occasionally with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> and rarely followed by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4268622" conceptname="Stricture of esophagus">esophageal stricture</span> or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates including alendronate. In some cases these have been severe and required hospitalization. Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to discontinue alendronate and seek medical attention if they develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31317" conceptname="Dysphagia">dysphagia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4147218" conceptname="Swallowing painful">odynophagia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77670" conceptname="Chest pain">retrosternal pain</span> or new or worsening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="23325" conceptname="Heartburn">heartburn</span>.</p>
<p>The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates including alendronate and/or who fail to swallow oral bisphosphonates including alendronate with the recommended full glass (6 to 8 oz) of water, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates including alendronate after developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient [<span class="Italics">see<a href="#S2.6"> Dosage and Administration (2.6)</a></span>]. In patients who cannot comply with dosing instructions due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4170893" conceptname="Mental handicap">mental disability</span>, therapy with alendronate should be used under appropriate supervision.</p>
<p>There have been post-marketing reports of gastric and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4057053" conceptname="Acute duodenal ulcer">duodenal ulcers</span> with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications, although no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials [<span class="Italics">see<a href="#S6.2"> Adverse Reactions (6.2)</a></span>].</p>

<h2>5.2 Mineral Metabolism</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435510" conceptname="Hypocalcemia">Hypocalcemia</span> must be corrected before initiating therapy with alendronate [<span class="Italics">see<a href="#S4"> Contraindications (4)</a></span>]. Other disorders affecting mineral metabolism (such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436070" conceptname="Vitamin D deficiency">vitamin D deficiency</span>) should also be effectively treated. In patients with these conditions, serum calcium and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435510" conceptname="Hypocalcemia">hypocalcemia</span> should be monitored during therapy with alendronate.</p>
<p>Presumably due to the effects of alendronate on increasing bone mineral, small, asymptomatic decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur, especially in patients with Paget's disease, in whom the pretreatment rate of bone turnover may be greatly elevated, and in patients receiving glucocorticoids, in whom calcium absorption may be decreased.</p>
<p>Ensuring adequate calcium and vitamin D intake is especially important in patients with Paget's disease of bone and in patients receiving glucocorticoids.</p>

This category of drugs includes alendronate. Most of the patients were postmenopausal women. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate.</p>
<p>In placebo-controlled clinical studies of alendronate, the percentages of patients with these symptoms were similar in the alendronate and placebo groups.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77650" conceptname="Aseptic necrosis of bone">Osteonecrosis</span> of the jaw (ONJ), which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including alendronate. Known risk factors for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77650" conceptname="Aseptic necrosis of bone">osteonecrosis</span> of the jaw include invasive dental procedures (e.g., tooth extraction, dental implants, boney surgery), diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, corticosteroids), poor oral hygiene, and co-morbid disorders (e.g., periodontal and/or other pre-existing dental disease, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432585" conceptname="Blood coagulation disorder">coagulopathy</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, ill-fitting dentures).</p>
<p>For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk for ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment.</p>
<p>Patients who develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77650" conceptname="Aseptic necrosis of bone">osteonecrosis</span> of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy should receive care by an oral surgeon. In these patients, extensive dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered based on individual benefit/risk assessment.</p>

Study 1 and Study 2 were identically designed, three-year, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter studies (United States and Multinational n=994); Study 3 was the three year <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4066995" conceptname="Fracture of vertebral column with spinal cord injury">vertebral fracture</span> cohort of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">Fracture</span> Intervention Trial [FIT] (n=2027) and Study 4 was the four-year clinical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">fracture</span> cohort of FIT (n=4432). Overall, 3620 patients were exposed to placebo and 3432 patients exposed to alendronate. Patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal disease and concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were included in these clinical trials. In Study 1 and Study 2 all women received 500 mg elemental calcium as carbonate. In Study 3 and Study 4 all women with dietary calcium intake less than 1000 mg per day received 500 mg calcium and 250 IU Vitamin D per day.</p>
<p>Among patients treated with alendronate 10 mg or placebo in Study 1 and Study 2, and all patients in Study 3 and Study 4, the incidence of all-cause mortality was 1.8% in the placebo group and 1.8% in the alendronate group. The incidence of serious adverse event was 30.7% in the placebo group and 30.9% in the alendronate group. The percentage of patients who discontinued the study due to any clinical adverse event was 9.5% in the placebo group and 8.9% in the alendronate group. Adverse reactions from these studies considered by the investigators as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related in ≥1% of patients treated with either alendronate or placebo are presented in Table 1.</p>

<h2>7.1 Calcium Supplements/Antacids</h2>
<p class="First">Co-administration of alendronate and calcium, antacids, or oral medications containing multivalent cations will interfere with absorption of alendronate. Therefore, patients must wait at least one-half hour after taking alendronate before taking any other oral medications.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pregnancy Category C: </span>There are no studies in pregnant women. Alendronate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the mother and fetus.</p>
<p>Bisphosphonates are incorporated into the bone matrix, from which they are gradually released over a period of years. The amount of bisphosphonate incorporated into adult bone, and hence, the amount available for release back into the systemic circulation, is directly related to the dose and duration of bisphosphonate use. There are no data on fetal risk in humans. However, there is a theoretical risk of fetal harm, predominantly skeletal, if a woman becomes pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. The impact of variables such as time between cessation of bisphosphonate therapy to conception, the particular bisphosphonate used, and the route of administration (intravenous versus oral) on the risk has not been studied.</p>
<p>Reproduction studies in rats showed decreased postimplantation survival and decreased body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span> in normal pups at doses less than half of the recommended clinical dose. Sites of incomplete fetal ossification were statistically significantly increased in rats beginning at approximately 3 times the clinical dose in vertebral (cervical, thoracic, and lumbar), skull, and sternebral bones. No similar fetal effects were seen when pregnant rabbits were treated with doses approximately 10 times the clinical dose.</p>
<p>Both total and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4125860" conceptname="Calcium electrolyte">ionized calcium</span> decreased in pregnant rats at approximately 4 times the clinical dose resulting in delays and failures of delivery.

Maternotoxicity (late pregnancy <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span>) also occurred in the female rats treated at approximately 4 times the clinical dose for varying periods of time ranging from treatment only during pre-mating to treatment only during early, middle, or late gestation; these <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> were lessened but not eliminated by cessation of treatment. Calcium supplementation either in the drinking water or by minipump could not ameliorate the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435510" conceptname="Hypocalcemia">hypocalcemia</span> or prevent maternal and neonatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> due to delays in delivery; intravenous calcium supplementation prevented maternal, but not <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079844" conceptname="Fetal death">fetal deaths</span>.</p>

<h2>8.4 Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Alendronate is not indicated for use in pediatric patients.</p>
<p>The safety and efficacy of alendronate were examined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled two-year study of 139 pediatric patients, aged 4 to 18 years, with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="78257" conceptname="Osteogenesis imperfecta">osteogenesis imperfecta</span> (OI). One-hundred-and-nine patients were randomized to 5 mg alendronate daily (weight &lt;40 kg) or 10 mg alendronate daily (weight ≥40 kg) and 30 patients to placebo. The mean baseline lumbar spine BMD Z-score of the patients was -4.5. The mean change in lumbar spine BMD Z-score from baseline to Month 24 was 1.3 in the alendronate-treated patients and 0.1 in the placebo-treated patients. Treatment with alendronate did not reduce the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">fracture</span>. Sixteen percent of the alendronate patients who sustained a radiologically-confirmed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">fracture</span> by Month 12 of the study had delayed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">fracture</span> healing (callus remodeling) or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75053" conceptname="Fracture of bone">fracture</span> non-union when assessed radiographically at Month 24 compared with 9% of the placebo-treated patients. In alendronate-treated patients, bone histomorphometry data obtained at Month 24 demonstrated decreased bone turnover and delayed mineralization time; however, there were no mineralization defects. There were no statistically significant differences between the alendronate and placebo groups in reduction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129418" conceptname="Bone pain">bone pain</span>. The oral bioavailability in children was similar to that observed in adults.</p>
<p>The overall safety profile of alendronate in OI patients treated for up to 24 months was generally similar to that of adults with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> treated with alendronate. However, there was an increased occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> in OI patients treated with alendronate compared to placebo. During the 24-month treatment period, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> was observed in 32 of 109 (29.4%) patients treated with alendronate and 3 of 30 (10%) patients treated with placebo.</p>
<p>In a pharmacokinetic study, 6 of 24 pediatric OI patients who received a single oral dose of alendronate 35 or 70 mg developed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, flu-like symptoms, and/or mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441541" conceptname="Lymphocytopenia">lymphocytopenia</span> within 24 to 48 hours after administration. These events, lasting no more than 2 to 3 days and responding to acetaminophen, are consistent with an acute-phase response that has been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonates, including alendronate [<span class="Italics">see<a href="#S6.2"> Adverse Reactions (6.2)</a></span>].</p>

<h1>11 DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Alendronate sodium is a bisphosphonate that acts as a specific inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Bisphosphonates are synthetic analogs of pyrophosphate that bind to the hydroxyapatite found in bone.</p>
<p>Alendronate sodium is chemically described as (4-amino-1-hydroxybutylidene) bisphosphonic acid monosodium salt trihydrate.</p>
<p>The empirical formula of alendronate sodium is C<span class="Sub">4</span>H<span class="Sub">12</span>NNaO<span class="Sub">7</span>P<span class="Sub">2</span>∙3H<span class="Sub">2</span>O and its formula weight is 325.12. The structural formula is:</p>

<p>Alendronate sodium is a white, crystalline, nonhygroscopic powder. It is soluble in water, very slightly soluble in alcohol, and practically insoluble in chloroform.</p>
<p>Each bottle of the oral solution contains 91.35 mg of alendronate monosodium salt trihydrate, which is the molar equivalent to 70 mg of free acid. Each bottle also contains the following inactive ingredients: citric acid (anhydrous), methyl paraben, propylparaben, raspberry blend, saccharin sodium, and sodium citrate.</p>

<h2>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Animal studies have indicated the following mode of action. At the cellular level, alendronate shows preferential localization to sites of bone resorption, specifically under osteoclasts. The osteoclasts adhere normally to the bone surface but lack the ruffled border that is indicative of active resorption. Alendronate does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment or attachment, but it does inhibit osteoclast activity. Studies in mice on the localization of radioactive [<span class="Sup">3</span>H]alendronate in bone showed about 10-fold higher uptake on osteoclast surfaces than on osteoblast surfaces. Bones examined 6 and 49 days after [<span class="Sup">3</span>H]alendronate administration in rats and mice, respectively, showed that normal bone was formed on top of the alendronate, which was incorporated inside the matrix. While incorporated in bone matrix, alendronate is not pharmacologically active. Thus, alendronate must be continuously administered to suppress osteoclasts on newly formed resorption surfaces. Histomorphometry in baboons and rats showed that alendronate treatment reduces bone turnover (i.e., the number of sites at which bone is remodeled). In addition, bone formation exceeds bone resorption at these remodeling sites, leading to progressive gains in bone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span>.</p>

<h2>12.2 Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that binds to bone hydroxyapatite and specifically inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells. Alendronate reduces bone resorption with no direct effect on bone formation, although the latter process is ultimately reduced because bone resorption and formation are coupled during bone turnover.</p>

<p>Daily oral doses of alendronate (5, 20, and 40 mg for six weeks) in postmenopausal women produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent inhibition of bone resorption, including decreases in urinary calcium and urinary markers of bone collagen degradation (such as deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen). These biochemical changes tended to return toward baseline values as early as 3 weeks following the discontinuation of therapy with alendronate and did not differ from placebo after 7 months.</p>
<p>Long-term treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> with alendronate 10 mg/day (for up to five years) reduced urinary excretion of markers of bone resorption, deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type l collagen, by approximately 50% and 70%, respectively, to reach levels similar to those seen in healthy premenopausal women. Similar decreases were seen in patients in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> prevention studies who received alendronate 5 mg/day. The decrease in the rate of bone resorption indicated by these markers was evident as early as one month and at three to six months reached a plateau that was maintained for the entire duration of treatment with alendronate. In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> treatment studies alendronate 10 mg/day decreased the markers of bone formation, osteocalcin and bone specific alkaline phosphatase by approximately 50%, and total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 25 to 30% to reach a plateau after 6 to 12 months. In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> prevention studies alendronate 5 mg/day decreased osteocalcin and total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 40% and 15%, respectively. Similar reductions in the rate of bone turnover were observed in postmenopausal women during one-year studies with once weekly alendronate 70 mg for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span> and once weekly alendronate 35 mg for the prevention of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span>. These data indicate that the rate of bone turnover reached a new steady-state, despite the progressive increase in the total amount of alendronate deposited within bone.</p>
<p>As a result of inhibition of bone resorption, asymptomatic reductions in serum calcium and phosphate concentrations were also observed following treatment with alendronate. In the long-term studies, reductions from baseline in serum calcium (approximately 2%) and phosphate (approximately 4 to 6%) were evident the first month after the initiation of alendronate 10 mg. No further decreases in serum calcium were observed for the five-year duration of treatment; however, serum phosphate returned toward prestudy levels during years three through five. Similar reductions were observed with alendronate 5 mg/day. In one-year studies with once weekly alendronate 35 and 70 mg, similar reductions were observed at 6 and 12 months. The reduction in serum phosphate may reflect not only the positive bone mineral balance due to alendronate but also a decrease in renal phosphate reabsorption.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Absorption: </span>Relative to an intravenous reference dose, the mean oral bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses ranging from 5 to 70 mg when administered after an overnight fast and two hours before a standardized breakfast.

<p>Alendronate 70 mg oral solution and alendronate 70 mg tablet are equally bioavailable.</p>
<p>A study examining the effect of timing of a meal on the bioavailability of alendronate was performed in 49 postmenopausal women. Bioavailability was decreased (by approximately 40%) when 10 mg alendronate was administered either 0.5 or 1 hour before a standardized breakfast, when compared to dosing 2 hours before eating. In studies of treatment and prevention of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80502" conceptname="Osteoporosis">osteoporosis</span>, alendronate was effective when administered at least 30 minutes before breakfast.</p>
<p>Bioavailability was negligible whether alendronate was administered with or up to two hours after a standardized breakfast. Concomitant administration of alendronate with coffee or orange juice reduced bioavailability by approximately 60%.</p>

Plasma concentrations fell by more than 95% within 6 hours following intravenous administration. The terminal half-life in humans is estimated to exceed 10 years, probably reflecting release of alendronate from the skeleton. Based on the above, it is estimated that after 10 years of oral treatment with alendronate (10 mg daily) the amount of alendronate released daily from the skeleton is approximately 25% of that absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.</p>

Although no formal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> pharmacokinetic study has been conducted in patients, it is likely that, as in animals, elimination of alendronate via the kidney will be reduced in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>.

<p>At three years significant increases in BMD, relative both to baseline and placebo, were seen at each measurement site in each study in patients who received alendronate 10 mg/day. Total body BMD also increased significantly in each study, suggesting that the increases in bone <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> of the spine and hip did not occur at the expense of other skeletal sites. Increases in BMD were evident as early as three months and continued throughout the three years of treatment. (See<a href="#fig3"> Figure 3 </a>for lumbar spine results.) In the two-year extension of these studies, treatment of 147 patients with alendronate 10 mg/day resulted in continued increases in BMD at the lumbar spine and trochanter (absolute additional increases between years 3 and 5: lumbar spine, 0.94%; trochanter, 0.88%). BMD at the femoral neck, forearm and total body were maintained. Alendronate was similarly effective regardless of age, race, baseline rate of bone turnover, and baseline BMD in the range studied (at least 2 standard deviations below the premenopausal mean).</p>

<h2>17.2 Dosing Instructions</h2>
<p class="First">Patients should be instructed that the expected benefits of alendronate may only be obtained when it is taken with plain water the first thing upon arising for the day at least 30 minutes before the first food, beverage, or medication of the day. Even dosing with orange juice or coffee has been shown to markedly reduce the absorption of alendronate [<span class="Italics">see<a href="#S12.3"> Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</a></span>].</p>
<p>To facilitate gastric emptying, patients should drink at least 2 oz (a quarter of a cup) of water after taking alendronate oral solution.</p>
<p>Patients should be instructed not to lie down for at least 30 minutes <span class="Underline">and</span> until after their first food of the day.</p>
<p>Patients should be specifically instructed not to take alendronate at bedtime or before arising for the day. Patients should be informed that failure to follow these instructions may increase their risk of esophageal problems.</p>
<p>Patients should be instructed that if they develop symptoms of esophageal disease (such as difficulty or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> upon swallowing, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77670" conceptname="Chest pain">retrosternal pain</span> or new or worsening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="23325" conceptname="Heartburn">heartburn</span>) they should stop taking alendronate and consult their physician.</p>
<p>Patients should be instructed that if they miss a dose of once weekly alendronate, they should take one dose on the morning after they remember. They should not take two doses on the same day but should return to taking one dose once a week, as originally scheduled on their chosen day.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">Some people who take alendronate may develop problems in the esophagus (the tube that connects the mouth and the stomach). These problems include irritation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcers</span> of the esophagus which may sometimes bleed.</span></p>
<ul class="Disc">
<li><span class="Bold">It is important that you take alendronate exactly as prescribed to help lower your chance of getting esophagus problems. (See the section "<a href="#howshouldi">How should I take once weekly alendronate sodium oral solution</a>?")</span></li>

<p>Alendronate may lower the calcium levels in your blood. If you have low blood calcium before you start taking alendronate, it may get worse during treatment. Your low blood calcium must be treated before you take alendronate. Most people with low blood calcium levels do not have symptoms, but some people may have symptoms. Call your doctor right away if you have symptoms of low blood calcium such as:</p>
<ul class="Disc">
<li><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75635" conceptname="Cramp">Spasms</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4247265" conceptname="Muscle twitch">twitches</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75635" conceptname="Cramp">cramps</span> in your muscles</li>
