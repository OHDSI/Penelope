<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Trazodone HCl is an antidepressant chemically unrelated to tricyclic, 
tetracyclic, or other known antidepressant agents. Trazodone HCl is a 
triazolopyridine derivative designated as 
2-[3-[4-(m-Chlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]propyl]s-triazolo[4,3-a]-pyridin-3 
(2H)-one monohydrochloride. It is a white to off-white crystalline powder which 
is sparingly soluble in chloroform and in water. Its molecular weight is 408.3. 
The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">19</span>H<span class="Sub">22</span>ClN<span class="Sub">5</span>Oâ€¢HCl and the structural formula 
is represented as follows:</p>
<br><p><img alt="Structural Formula" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=10124262-e443-49a5-a1cc-8cc34c74d953&amp;name=TRAZODONE%20HCL%20STRUCTURE.jpg"></p>
<p>Each tablet, for oral administration, contains 50 mg, 100 mg or 150 mg of 
trazodone hydrochloride, USP. In addition, each tablet contains the following 
inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, anhydrous lactose, magnesium 
stearate, microcrystalline cellulose and sodium starch glycolate.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">The mechanism of trazodone HClâ€™s antidepressant action in man is not fully 
understood. In animals, trazodone HCl selectively inhibits its serotonin uptake 
by brain synaptosomes and potentiates the behavioral changes induced by the 
serotonin precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan. Cardiac conduction effects of 
trazodone HCl in the anesthetized dog are qualitatively dissimilar and 
quantitatively less pronounced than those seen with tricyclic antidepressants. 
Trazodone HCl is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and, unlike amphetamine type 
drugs, does not stimulate the central nervous system.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="43682-4">
<a name="section-2.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<a href="http://"></a>Absorption<p class="First">In humans, trazodone is well absorbed after oral administration 
without selective localization in any tissue. When trazodone is taken shortly 
after ingestion of food, there may be an increase in the amount of drug 
absorbed, a decrease in maximum concentration and a lengthening in the time to 
maximum concentration. Peak plasma levels occur approximately one hour after 
dosing when trazodone is taken on an empty stomach or two hours after dosing 
when taken with food.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Metabolism<p>In vitro studies in human liver microsomes show that trazodone is 
metabolized to an active metabolite, m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) by 
cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Other metabolic pathways that may be involved in 
metabolism of trazodone have not been well characterized.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Elimination<p>In some patients trazodone may accumulate in the plasma.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Drug-Drug Interactions<p>See also <a href="#section-8.5">PRECAUTIONS: Drug 
Interactions</a>. In vitro drug metabolism studies reveal that trazodone is a 
substrate of the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme and trazodone metabolism 
can be inhibited by the CYP3A4 inhibitors ketoconazole, ritonavir, and 
indinavir. The effect of short-term administration of ritonavir (200 mg twice 
daily, 4 doses) on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of trazodone (50 mg) 
has been studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax of trazodone increased by 34%, 
the AUC increased 2.4-fold, the half-life increased by 2.2-fold, and the 
clearance decreased by 52%. Adverse effects including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, and 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">syncope</span> were observed when ritonavir and trazodone were co-administered.</p>
<p>Carbamazepine induces CYP34A. Following co-administration of carbamazepine 
400 mg/day with trazodone 100 mg to 300 mg daily, carbamazepine reduced plasma 
concentrations of trazodone (as well as mCPP) by 76 and 60%, respectively, 
compared to pre-carbamazepine values.</p>
<p>For those patients who responded to trazodone HCl, one-third of the 
inpatients and one-half of the outpatients had a significant therapeutic 
response by the end of the first week of treatment. Three-fourths of all 
responders demonstrated a significant therapeutic effect by the end of the 
second week. One-fourth of responders required 2-4 weeks for a significant 
therapeutic response.</p>

<h2>Clinical Worsening and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> Risk</h2>
<p class="First">Patients with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD), both adult and 
pediatric, may experience worsening of their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and/or the emergence of 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4092095" conceptname="Planning suicide">suicidal ideation</span> and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, 
whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may 
persist until significant remission occurs. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> is a known risk of 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders 
themselves are the strongest predictors of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>. There has been a 
long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing 
worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients 
during the early phases of treatment. </p>
<p>Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant 
drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal 
thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults 
(aged 18-24) with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD) and other psychiatric 
disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of 
suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; 
there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 
and older.</p>
<p>The pooled analysis of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents 
with MDD, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440374" conceptname="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">obsessive compulsive disorder</span> (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders 
including a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 
patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or 
other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median 
duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There 
was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency 
toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There 
were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different 
indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs 
placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across 
indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of 
cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.</p>

<p>No <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> in 
the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion 
about the drug effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>.</p>
<p>It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., 
beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from 
placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> that the use of 
antidepressants can delay the recurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.</p>
<p>All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be 
monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, 
suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few 
months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either 
increases or decreases. </p>

patients being treated with antidepressants for major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> as 
well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a 
causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, 
there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging 
suicidality.</p>
<p>Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including 
possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> is 
persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms 
that might be precursors to worsening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> or suicidality, especially if 
these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patientâ€™s 
presenting symptoms.</p>
<p>Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for 
major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> or other indications, both psychiatric and 
nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the 
emergence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, unusual changes in behavior, and the other 
symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report 
such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should 
include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for 
trazodone HCl should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent 
with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>.</p>

<h2>Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder</h2>
<p class="First">A major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive episode</span> may be the initial presentation of 
bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled 
trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase 
the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic episode</span> in patients at risk for 
bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a 
conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an 
antidepressant, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4191716" conceptname="Symptoms of depression">depressive symptoms</span> should be adequately screened 
to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should 
include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>, 
bipolar disorder, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>. It should be noted that trazodone HCl is not 
approved for use in treating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436665" conceptname="Bipolar disorder">bipolar depression</span>.</p>
<p>TRAZODONE HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE OCCURRENCE OF <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315586" conceptname="Priapism">PRIAPISM</span>. IN MANY OF THE 
CASES REPORTED, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4121697" conceptname="Surgery">SURGICAL INTERVENTION</span> WAS REQUIRED AND, IN SOME OF THESE CASES, 
PERMANENT IMPAIRMENT OF ERECTILE FUNCTION OR <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">IMPOTENCE</span> RESULTED. MALE PATIENTS 
WITH PROLONGED OR INAPPROPRIATE ERECTIONS SHOULD IMMEDIATELY DISCONTINUE THE 
DRUG AND CONSULT THEIR PHYSICIAN.</p>
<p>The detumescence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315586" conceptname="Priapism">priapism</span> and drug-induced penile erections has been 
accomplished by both pharmacologic, e.g., the intracavernosal injection of 
alpha-adrenergic stimulants such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, as well as 
surgical procedures.b-g Any pharmacologic or surgical procedure utilized in the 
treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315586" conceptname="Priapism">priapism</span> should be performed under the supervision of a urologist 
or a physician familiar with the procedure and should not be initiated without 
urologic consultation if the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315586" conceptname="Priapism">priapism</span> has persisted for more than 24 hours.</p>
<p>Trazodone is not recommended for use during the initial recovery phase of 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>.</p>
<p>Caution should be used when administering trazodone HCl to patients with 
cardiac disease, and such patients should be closely monitored, since 
antidepressant drugs (including trazodone HCl) have been associated with the 
occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmias</span>. Recent clinical studies in patients with 
pre-existing cardiac disease indicate that trazodone HCl may be arrhythmogenic 
in some patients in that population. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">Arrhythmias</span> identified include isolated 
PVCs, ventricular couplets, and in two patients short episodes (3-4 beats) of

<p class="First">The possibility of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span> in seriously depressed patients is 
inherent in the illness and may persist until significant remission occurs. 
Therefore, prescriptions should be written for the smallest number of tablets

<p>Little is known about the interaction between trazodone HCl and general 
anesthetics; therefore, prior to elective surgery, trazodone HCl should be 
discontinued for as long as clinically feasible.</p>
<p>As with all antidepressants, the use of trazodone HCl should be based on the

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, 
their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated 
with treatment with trazodone HCl and should counsel them in its appropriate 
use. A patient Medication Guide about â€œAntidepressant Medicines, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> and 
other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actionsâ€? is available for 
trazodone HCl. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, 
their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should 
assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the 
opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain 
answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication 
Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.</p>

close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication.</p>
<p>Because <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315586" conceptname="Priapism">priapism</span> has been reported to occur in patients receiving trazodone 
HCl, patients with prolonged or inappropriate penile erection should immediately 
discontinue the drug and consult with the physician (see <a href="#section-7">WARNINGS</a>).</p>
<p>Antidepressants may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for 
the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as operating an automobile 
or machinery; the patient should be cautioned accordingly.</p>
<p>Trazodone HCl may enhance the response to alcohol, barbiturates, and other 
CNS depressants.</p>
<p>Trazodone HCl should be given shortly after a meal or light snack. Within any 
individual patient, total drug absorption may be up to 20% higher when the drug 
is taken with food rather than on an empty stomach. The risk of

<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">Occasional low white blood cell and neutrophil counts have been noted in 
patients receiving trazodone HCl. These were not considered clinically 
significant and did not necessitate discontinuation of the drug; however, the 
drug should be discontinued in any patient whose white blood cell count or 
absolute neutrophil count <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falls</span> below normal levels. White blood cell and 
differential counts are recommended for patients who develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span> and sore

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34073-7">

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">In vitro drug metabolism studies suggest that there is a 
potential for drug interactions when trazodone is given with CYP3A4 inhibitors. 
Ritonavir, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the Cmax, AUC, and elimination 
half-life, and decreased clearance of trazodone after administration of 
ritonavir twice daily for 2 days. Adverse effects including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, 
and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">syncope</span> were observed when ritonavir and trazodone were co-administered. It 
is likely that ketoconazole, indinavir, and other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as 
intraconazole or nefazadone may lead to substantial increases in trazodone 
plasma concentrations, with the potential for adverse effects. If trazodone is 
used with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, a lower dose of trazodone should be 
considered.</p>
<p>Carbamazepine reduced plasma concentrations of trazodone when 
co-administered. Patients should be more closely monitored to see if there is a 
need for an increased dose of trazodone when taking both drugs.</p>
<p>Increased serum digoxin or phenytoin levels have been reported to occur in 
patients receiving trazodone concurrently with either of those two drugs.</p>
<p>It is not known whether interactions will occur between monoamine oxidase 
(MAO) inhibitors and trazodone HCl. Due to the absence of clinical experience, 
if MAO inhibitors are discontinued shortly before or are to be given 
concomitantly with trazodone HCl, therapy should be initiated cautiously with 
gradual increase in dosage until optimum response is achieved.</p>

<h2>Therapeutic Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Concurrent administration with electroshock therapy should be 
avoided because of the absence of experience in this area.</p>
<p>There have been reports of increased and decreased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time occurring

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility </h2>

receiving trazodone HCl in daily oral doses up to 300 mg/kg for 18 months.</p>

<h2>Pregnancy</h2>
<a href="http://"></a>Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C <p class="First">Trazodone hydrochloride has been shown to cause increased fetal 
resorption and other adverse effects on the fetus in two studies using the rat 
when given at dose levels approximately 30-50 times the proposed maximum human 
dose. There was also an increase in congenital anomalies in one of three rabbit 
studies at approximately 15-50 times the maximum human dose. There are no 
adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Trazodone HCl should be 
used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk 
to the fetus.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers </h2>
<p class="First">Trazodone HCl and/or its metabolites have been found in the milk of lactating 
rats, suggesting that the drug may be secreted in human milk. Caution should be 
exercised when trazodone HCl is administered to a nursing woman.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Because the frequency of adverse drug effects is affected by diverse factors 
(e.g., drug dose, method of detection, physician judgment, disease under 
treatment, etc.) a single meaningful estimate of adverse event incidence is 
difficult to obtain. This problem is illustrated by the variation in adverse 
event incidence observed and reported from the inpatients and outpatients 
treated with trazodone HCl. It is impossible to determine precisely what 
accounts for the differences observed.</p>

<h2>Clinical Trial Reports </h2>
<p class="First">Table 2 below is presented solely to indicate the relative 
frequency of adverse events reported in representative controlled clinical 
studies conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of trazodone HCl.</p>
<p>The figures cited cannot be used to predict precisely the incidence of 
untoward events in the course of usual medical practice where patient 
characteristics and other factors often differ from those which prevailed in 
clinical trials. These incidence figures, also, cannot be compared with those 
obtained from other clinical studies involving related drug products and placebo 
as each group of drug trials is conducted under a different set of 
conditions.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Animal Oral LD50: The oral LD50 of the drug is 610 mg/kg in mice, 
486 mg/kg in rats, and 560 mg/kg in rabbits.</p>
<p>Signs and Symptoms: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Death</span> from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> has occurred in patients ingesting 
trazodone HCl and other drugs concurrently (namely, alcohol; alcohol + chloral 
hydrate + diazepam; amobarbital; chlordiazepoxide; or meprobamate).</p>
<p>The most severe reactions reported to have occurred with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> of 
trazodone HCl alone have been <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315586" conceptname="Priapism">priapism</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317109" conceptname="Respiratory arrest">respiratory arrest</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>, and EKG

the reported adverse reactions (see <a href="#section-9">ADVERSE 
REACTIONS</a>).</p>

<a name="section-8.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Treatment
</h2>
<p class="First">There is no specific antidote for trazodone HCl. Treatment should be symptomatic 
and supportive in the case of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> or excessive sedation. Any patient 
suspected of having taken an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> should have the stomach emptied by gastric 
lavage. Forced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span> may be useful in facilitating elimination of the drug.</p>

<a name="section-9"></a><p></p>
<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">The dosage should be initiated at a low level and increased 
gradually, noting the clinical response and any evidence of intolerance. 
Occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> may require the administration of a major portion of 
the daily dose at bedtime or a reduction of dosage. Trazodone HCl should be 
taken shortly after a meal or light snack. Symptomatic relief may be seen during 
the first week with optimal antidepressant effects typically evident within two 
weeks. Twenty-five percent of those who respond to trazodone HCl require more 
than two weeks (up to four weeks) of drug administration.</p>
<p>Usual Adult Dosage: An initial dose of 150 mg/day in divided doses is 
suggested. The dose may be increased by 50 mg/day every three to four days. The 
maximum dose for outpatients usually should not exceed 400 mg/day in divided 
doses. Inpatients (i.e., more severely depressed patients) may be given up to 
but not in excess of 600 mg/day in divided doses.</p>
<p>Maintenance: Dosage during prolonged maintenance therapy should be kept at 
the lowest effective level. Once an adequate response has been achieved, dosage 
may be gradually reduced, with subsequent adjustment depending on therapeutic 
response.</p>
<p>Although there has been no systematic evaluation of the efficacy of trazodone 
beyond 6 weeks, it is generally recommended that a course of antidepressant drug 
treatment should be continued for several months.</p>

<h1>Medication Guide</h1>
<p class="First">Antidepressant Medicines, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> and other Serious Mental 
Illnesses, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions</p>
<p>Read the Medication Guide that comes with you or your family memberâ€™s 
antidepressant medicine. This Medication Guide is only about the risk of 
suicidal thoughts and actions with antidepressant medicines. Talk to your, or 
your family memberâ€™s, healthcare provider about:</p>
<p>â€¢ all risks and benefits of treatment with antidepressant medicines</p>
<p>â€¢ all treatment choices for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> or other serious mental illness</p>
<p>What is the most important information I should know about antidepressant 
medicines, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and other serious mental illnesses, and suicidal thoughts 
or actions?</p>
<p>1. Antidepressant medicines may increase suicidal thoughts or actions in some 
children, teenagers, and young adults within the first few months of 
treatment.</p>
<p>2. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> and other serious mental illnesses are the most important 
causes of suicidal thoughts and actions. Some people may have a particularly 
high risk of having suicidal thoughts or actions. These include people who have 
(or have a family history of) bipolar illness (also called <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span>-depressive 
illness) or suicidal thoughts or actions.</p>
<p>3. How can I watch for and try to prevent suicidal thoughts and actions in 
myself or a family member?</p>
<p>â€¢ Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, 
behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. This is very important when an antidepressant 
medicine is started or when the dose is changed.</p>
<p>â€¢ Call the healthcare provider right away to report new or sudden changes in 
mood, behavior, thoughts, or feelings.</p>
<p>â€¢ Keep all follow-up visits with the healthcare provider as scheduled. Call 
the healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you have 
concerns about symptoms.</p>
<p>Call a healthcare provider right away if you or your family member has any of 
the following symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">worry</span> you:</p>

<p>What else do I need to know about antidepressant medicines?</p>
<p>â€¢ Never stop an antidepressant medicine without first talking to a healthcare 
provider. Stopping an antidepressant medicine suddenly can cause other 
symptoms.</p>
<p>â€¢ Antidepressants are medicines used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and other illnesses. 
It is important to discuss all the risks of treating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and also the 
risks of not treating it. Patients and their families or other caregivers should 
discuss all treatment choices with the healthcare provider, not just the use of 
antidepressants.</p>
<p>â€¢ Antidepressant medicines have other side effects. Talk to the healthcare 
provider about the side effects of the medicine prescribed for you or your 
family member.</p>
<p>â€¢ Antidepressant medicines can interact with other medicines. Know all of the 
medicines that you or your family member takes. Keep a list of all medicines to 
show the healthcare provider. Do not start new medicines without first checking 
with your healthcare provider.</p>
<p>â€¢ Not all antidepressant medicines prescribed for children are FDA approved 
for use in children. Talk to your childâ€™s healthcare provider for more 
information.</p>
<p>Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects.</p>
<p>You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.</p>
