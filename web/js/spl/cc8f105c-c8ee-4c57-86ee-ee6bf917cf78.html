<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First"><span>DepoDur (morphine sulfate extended-release liposome injection) is a sterile suspension of multivesicular liposomes using proprietary DepoFoam<span class="Sup">®</span> formulation  technology containing morphine sulfate, intended for epidural administration.</span></p>
<p>Chemically, morphine sulfate is 7, 8-didehydro-4, 5α-epoxy-17-methylmorphinan-3, 6α -diol sulfate (2:1) (salt) pentahydrate with a molecular weight of 758. Morphine sulfate pentahydrate has the following structural formula: </p>
<p><img alt="Image from Drug Label Content" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=CC8F105C-C8EE-4C57-86EE-EE6BF917CF78&amp;name=depodur-figure-1.jpg"></p>
<p>Morphine base has a pK<span class="Sub">a</span> of 7.9, with an octanol/water partition coefficient of 1.42 at physiologic pH 7.4. At this pH, morphine’s tertiary amino group is mostly ionized, making the molecule water-soluble.</p>
<p>DepoDur is a sterile, non-pyrogenic, white to off-white, preservative-free suspension of multivesicular lipid-based particles containing Morphine Sulfate, USP. The median diameter of the liposome particles is in the range of 17 to 23 μm. The liposomes are suspended in a 0.9% sodium chloride solution. Each vial contains morphine sulfate (expressed as the pentahydrate) at a nominal concentration of 10 mg/mL. Inactive ingredients and their approximate concentrations are: 1,2-dioleoyl-<span class="Italics">sn</span>-glycero-3‑phosphocholine (DOPC), 4.2 mg/mL; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>, 3.3 mg/mL; 1,2-dipalmitoyl-<span class="Italics">sn</span>-glycero-3‑phospho-<span class="Italics">rac</span>-(1-glycerol) (DPPG), 0.9 mg/mL; tricaprylin, 0.3 mg/mL; and triolein, 0.1 mg/mL. The pH of DepoDur is in the range of 5.0 to 8.0.</p>
<p>After the administration of DepoDur into the epidural space, morphine sulfate is released from the multivesicular liposomes over a period of time.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Liposomal encapsulation or incorporation in a lipid complex can substantially affect a drug’s functional properties relative to those of the unencapsulated or nonlipid-associated drug. In addition, different liposomal or lipid-complexed products with a common active ingredient may vary from one another in the chemical composition and physical form of the lipid component. Such differences may affect functional properties of these drug products. DO NOT SUBSTITUTE.</span></p>

<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Epidural administration of morphine sulfate results in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> without attendant loss of motor, sensory, or sympathetic function.</p>
<p>Morphine released from DepoDur is absorbed both neuraxially and systemically.</p>
<p>Morphine, a pure opiate agonist, is relatively selective for the μ-receptor, although it can interact with other opiate receptors at higher doses. In addition to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, the widely diverse effects of morphine include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, changes in mood, decreased gastrointestinal motility, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, and alterations of the endocrine and autonomic nervous system.</p>

<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">The effects described below are common to all morphine-containing products.</p>

<p class="First">Effects on the Central Nervous System (CNS): The principal therapeutic action of morphine is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>. Other therapeutic effects of morphine include anxiolysis, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142453" conceptname="Feeling high">euphoria</span> and feelings of relaxation. Although the precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown, specific CNS opiate receptors and endogenous compounds with morphine-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are likely to play a role in the expression and perception of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effects</span>. As with all drugs in the opiate class, morphine can cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, in part by a direct effect on the brainstem respiratory centers. Morphine and related opiates depress the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> reflex by direct effect on the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>. Morphine may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435279" conceptname="Tonic pupillary reaction">miosis</span>, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opiate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>; however, when <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4139960" conceptname="Strangulation">asphyxia</span> is present during opiate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, marked <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4290615" conceptname="Dilated pupil">mydriasis</span> occurs.</p>

<p class="First">Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and on Other Smooth Muscle: Gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions are decreased by morphine. Morphine causes a reduction in motility and is associated with an increase in tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone can be increased to the point of spasm, often resulting in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">constipation</span>. Morphine can cause a marked increase in biliary tract pressure as a result of spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Morphine may also cause spasm of the sphincter of the urinary bladder.</p>

<p class="First">Effects on the Cardiovascular System: In therapeutic doses, morphine does not usually exert major effects on the cardiovascular system. Morphine, like other opiates, produces <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4237053" conceptname="Vasodilatation">peripheral vasodilatation</span> that may result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">fainting</span>. Release of histamine can occur, which may play a role in opiate-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>. Manifestations of histamine release and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4237053" conceptname="Vasodilatation">peripheral vasodilatation</span> may include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318566" conceptname="Flushing">flushing</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442546" conceptname="Red eye">red eyes</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span>.</p>

<p>DepoDur systemic AUC was comparable to that of morphine sulfate injection (approximately 90%), however, systemic C<span class="Sub">max</span> was 30 % of that of morphine sulfate injection.</p>
<p>Based on systemic AUC, DepoDur appears to exhibit dose proportionality over a dose range of 5 to 25 mg. In contrast, systemic C<span class="Sub">max</span> did not exhibit dose-proportionality and tended to increase by an amount less than the proportional change in dose (Table 2).</p>

<h3>Distribution</h3>
<p class="First">After morphine sulfate has been released from DepoDur and is absorbed systemically, morphine distribution is expected to be the same as for other morphine formulations.</p>
<p>Once absorbed, morphine is distributed to skeletal muscle, kidneys, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen and brain. The volume of distribution of morphine is approximately 1 to 4 L/kg. Morphine is 20 to 35% reversibly bound to plasma proteins. Morphine also crosses the placental membranes and has been found in breast milk.</p>

<h3>Metabolism</h3>
<p class="First">After morphine sulfate has been released from DepoDur and is absorbed systemically, morphine metabolism is expected to be the same as for other morphine formulations.</p>
<p>The major pathway of the detoxification of morphine is conjugation, either with D‑glucuronic acid in the liver to produce glucuronides or with sulfuric acid to give morphine-3-etheral sulfate. Although a small fraction (less than 5%) of morphine is demethylated, for all practical purposes, virtually all morphine is converted to glucuronide metabolites including morphine-3-glucuronide, M3G (about 50%) and morphine-6-glucuronide, M6G (about 5 to 15%). M3G has no significant analgesic activity. M6G has been shown to have opiate agonist and analgesic activity in humans.</p>

<h3>Excretion</h3>
<p class="First">After morphine sulfate has been released from DepoDur and is absorbed systemically, morphine excretion is expected to be the same as for other morphine formulations. DepoDur is intended for single dose administration, therefore, accumulation of morphine or its metabolites is not expected even in patients with impaired hepatic or renal function.</p>
<p>Approximately 10% of morphine dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted in the urine as M3G and M6G. A small amount of the glucuronide metabolites is excreted in the bile and there is some minor enterohepatic cycling. Seven to 10% of administered morphine is excreted in the feces. The mean adult plasma clearance is about 20–30 mL/minute/kg. The effective terminal half-life of morphine after IV administration is reported to be approximately 2 hours. In some studies involving longer periods of plasma sampling, a longer terminal half-life of morphine of about 15 hours was reported.</p>

<h3>Test Dose Interaction</h3>
<p class="First">Epidural administration of a 3-mL test dose (lidocaine 1.5% and epinephrine 1:200,000) may affect the release of morphine sulfate from DepoDur (see <a href="#E71E6BD2-3566-4488-ADF0-73DD4205F6E6">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</a>). This issue has been examined in patients who received epidural administration of 15 mg of DepoDur at various time intervals after the test dose (Table 3). The test groups included a no-test-dose group and 3-, 10- and 15-minute delays between test dose and DepoDur administration. Additionally, saline flush after the test dose was assessed. The serum concentration of morphine was measured as a biomarker.</p>

<h1>Clinical Studies</h1>
<p class="First">The efficacy of DepoDur was demonstrated in four clinical trials comprised of 876 patients undergoing surgical procedures such as hip arthroplasty, prostatectomy, colon resection and cesarean section. In these clinical trials, efficacy was assessed for at least 48 hours and safety for up to 30 days after DepoDur administration.</p>

<h2>Hip Arthroplasty</h2>
<p class="First">Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging studies evaluated the safety and efficacy of 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 mg DepoDur in 314 patients undergoing hip arthroplasty. The mean age of patients was 59 years (range 18 to 88 years). Study medication was administered approximately 30 minutes before surgery. Post-operatively, patients self-administered intravenous fentanyl via patient-controlled <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> (PCA) to maintain satisfactory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>.</p>
<br><p>In one study (N=194), single epidural administration of 15, 20, and 25 mg DepoDur provided superior analgesic efficacy compared to placebo (epidural saline injection followed by IV fentanyl PCA), as measured by decreased fentanyl use (Figure 1) and Visual Analog Scores (VAS) (Figure 2). The second clinical study in hip arthroplasty revealed similar results.<br></p>

<h2>Lower Abdominal Surgery</h2>
<p class="First">A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study evaluated the safety and efficacy of single epidural doses of 10, 15, 20, and 25 mg DepoDur compared to 5 mg DepoDur or 5 mg morphine sulfate in 487 patients undergoing lower abdominal surgery (i.e. surgery via an abdominal incision below umbilicus). Study medication was administered approximately 30 minutes prior to surgery. Post-operatively, patients self-administered intravenous fentanyl via patient-controlled <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> (PCA) to maintain satisfactory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>.

<h2>Cesarean Section</h2>
<p class="First">A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study evaluated the safety and efficacy of single epidural doses of 5, 10, and 15 mg DepoDur compared to epidural morphine sulfate injection (5 mg) in 75 patients undergoing elective cesarean section under intrathecal anesthesia. Study medication was administered following delivery and clamping of the umbilical cord. At the investigator’s discretion, patients were permitted to receive acetaminophen with codeine or intravenous morphine sulfate as an intermittent bolus or via PCA pump, post-operatively. DepoDur doses of 10 and 15 mg resulted in reduced use of rescue medication and improved post-operative <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> based on AUC analysis of VAS <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> scores at rest (R) and with activity (A), compared to morphine sulfate on average over the 48-hour period following elective cesarean section (Table 4).</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First">Due to the risk of severe adverse events when the epidural route of administration is employed, patients must be observed in a fully equipped and staffed environment for at least 48 hours after administration. <span class="Bold">The facility must be equipped to resuscitate patients with severe opiate overdosage, and the personnel must be familiar with the use and limitations of specific narcotic antagonists (naloxone, naltrexone) in such cases.</span><br></p>
<p><span class="Bold">No clinical studies have evaluated the safety of administration of DepoDur into the intrathecal space. DepoDur is intended for administration by the epidural route only.  However, cases of intrathecal administration of DepoDur have been reported during post-marketing experience. In all cases, signs of prolonged <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> were observed requiring narcotic antagonist (naloxone) administration or ventilatory support.</span></p>
<p><span>
Prolonged and serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span> has occurred when administration of epidural DepoDur was associated with subarachnoid puncture.  In these cases, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> has occurred within 12 hours of DepoDur administration following apparent recovery from anesthesia.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">Respiratory depression</span> resulting from DepoDur can be treated successfully with a naloxone bolus or, more commonly, a naloxone infusion; intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary in some cases.  </span></p>
<p><span>Because intrathecal leakage from the epidural space may occur through a breached dural membrane, especially when the epidural drug is administered in a bolus, DepoDur should not be administered to a patient following a recent dural puncture without vigilant monitoring of respiratory function for a prolonged period (48 hours) with provision for emergency mechanical ventilation to minimize the risk of serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>.  </span></p>
<p>DepoDur should be administered by or under the direction of a physician experienced in the techniques associated with epidural drug administration and familiar with patient management following epidural opiate administration, including the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>.</p>
<p>Prior to drug administration, the physician should be familiar with patient conditions (such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> at the injection site, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> diathesis, current and anticipated anticoagulant therapy, etc.) that call for special evaluation of the benefit versus risk potential.</p>

<h2>Impaired Respiration</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">Respiratory depression</span> is the chief hazard of all opiate preparations. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">Respiratory depression</span> occurs more frequently in elderly or debilitated patients and in those suffering from conditions accompanied by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxia</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4105765" conceptname="Hypercapnia">hypercapnia</span> in whom even moderate therapeutic doses may significantly decrease pulmonary ventilation.</p>
<p>Administration of opiates with or without coadministration of other sedative or hypnotic drugs can worsen airway obstruction in patients with obstructive sleep-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span> syndrome. Patients who are obese are at particular risk for this syndrome, which may be undiagnosed prior to administration.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">Respiratory depression</span> can occur with DepoDur. Four percent of the patients who received DepoDur required treatment with narcotic antagonists for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>. Ninety percent of events of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> started within the first 24 hours after dosing with DepoDur. However, the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> starting after 48 hours, potentially related to DepoDur, was 0.6% (5 of 900 patients). Patients at increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> such as those with impaired respiratory drive, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313459" conceptname="Sleep apnea">sleep apnea</span>, concomitant sedation or the elderly, may require monitoring for periods longer than 48 hours.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Because of the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, the facility must be equipped to resuscitate patients. Patients must be closely monitored in a fully equipped and staffed environment for a minimum of 48 hours.</span><br></p>
<p><span class="Bold">If the surgical procedure is cancelled after the administration of DepoDur, the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> may be increased, and patients should be monitored with a high level of vigilance.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Epidural local anesthetics should not be used before or after DepoDur, except in the form of a test dose. (See <a href="#E71E6BD2-3566-4488-ADF0-73DD4205F6E6">PRECAUTIONS – Drug Interactions</a>) Do not mix or co-administer DepoDur with any other medications including local anesthetics. Once DepoDur has been administered, no other medication should be administered into the epidural space for at least 48 hours.</span></p>

<h2>Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Opiates</h2>
<p class="First">The active ingredient of DepoDur is morphine, a μ-opiate agonist. DepoDur is a Schedule II controlled substance. Such drugs are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders. Diversion of Schedule II products is an act subject to criminal penalty. DepoDur can be abused in a manner similar to other opiate agonists, legal or illicit.</p>
<p>Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board, or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</p>

<h2>Hypotensive Effect</h2>
<p class="First">DepoDur, like all other opiates, may cause severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> in an individual whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a depleted blood volume or concurrent administration of drugs such as phenothiazines or general anesthetics (see also <a href="#E71E6BD2-3566-4488-ADF0-73DD4205F6E6">PRECAUTIONS – Drug Interactions</a>).

<h2>Use with Other Central Nervous System Depressants</h2>
<p class="First">The central nervous depressant effects of morphine are potentiated by the presence of other CNS depressants such as alcohol, other opiates, sedatives, antihistaminics or psychotropic drugs. Use of neuroleptics or general anesthetics in conjunction with epidural morphine may increase the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>.</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Epidural delivery of opiates is accompanied by risk to the patients and requires a high level of skill to be successfully accomplished. The task of treating these patients must be undertaken by experienced clinical teams, well-versed in patient selection and emerging standards of care. It is critical to adjust the dose of DepoDur for each individual patient, taking into account the patient’s prior experience with opiate analgesics (see <a href="#A3C3ABA2-BD76-47B9-88AE-AECC05533380">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">Seizures</span> may result from high doses of morphine.

<h2>Use in Hepatic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">Renal Disease</span></h2>
<p class="First">After morphine sulfate has been released from DepoDur and is absorbed systemically, its distribution, metabolism and excretion are expected to be the same as other morphine formulations. DepoDur is intended for single-dose administration; therefore accumulation of morphine or its metabolites is not expected even in patients with impaired hepatic or renal function.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenicity/Mutagenicity/Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of morphine sulfate have not been conducted. No formal studies to assess the mutagenic potential of morphine have been conducted. In the published literature, the results of <span class="Italics">in-vitro</span> studies showed that morphine is non-mutagenic in the <span class="Italics">Drosophila melanogaster</span> lethal mutation assay and produced no evidence of chromosomal aberrations when incubated with murine splenocytes.

<h3>Teratogenic Effects (Pregnancy Category C)</h3>
<p class="First">No formal studies to assess the teratogenic effects of morphine in animals have been performed. Several literature reports indicate that morphine administered subcutaneously during the early gestational period in mice and hamsters produced neurological, soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities. With one exception, the effects that have been reported were following doses that were maternally toxic and the abnormalities noted were characteristic of those observed when maternal toxicity is present. In one study, following subcutaneous infusion of doses greater than or equal to 0.15 mg/kg in mice, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4309376" conceptname="Exencephaly">exencephaly</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433811" conceptname="Hydronephrosis">hydronephrosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192671" conceptname="Gastrointestinal hemorrhage">intestinal hemorrhage</span>, split supraoccipital, malformed sternebrae, and malformed xiphoid were noted in the absence of maternal toxicity. In the hamster, morphine sulfate given subcutaneously on gestation day eight produced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4309376" conceptname="Exencephaly">exencephaly</span> and cranioschisis. Morphine was not a significant teratogen in the rat at exposure levels significantly beyond that normally encountered in clinical practice. In one study, however, decreased litter size and viability were observed in the offspring of male rats administered morphine at doses approximately 3-fold the maximum recommended human daily dose (MRHDD) for 10 days prior to mating. In two studies performed in the rabbit, no evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> was reported at subcutaneous doses up to 100 mg/kg.</p>
<p>In humans, the frequency of congenital anomalies has been reported to be no greater than expected among the children of 70 women who were treated with morphine during the first four months of pregnancy or in 448 women treated with this drug anytime during pregnancy. Furthermore, no malformations were observed in the infant of a woman who <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4219484" conceptname="Suicide attempt">attempted suicide</span> by taking an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> of morphine and other medication during the first trimester of pregnancy.</p>

<h3>Nonteratogenic Effects</h3>
<p class="First">Published literature indicates that exposure to morphine during pregnancy is associated with reduction in growth and a host of behavioral abnormalities in the offspring of animals. Morphine treatment during gestational periods of organogenesis in rats, hamsters, guinea pigs and rabbits resulted in the following treatment-related embryotoxicity and neonatal toxicity in one or more studies: decreased litter size, embryo-fetal viability, fetal and neonatal body weights, absolute brain and cerebellar weights, lengths or widths at birth and during the neonatal period, delayed motor and sexual maturation, and increased neonatal mortality, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438555" conceptname="Cyanosis">cyanosis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435371" conceptname="Hypothermia">hypothermia</span>.

Behavioral abnormalities resulting from chronic morphine exposure of fetal animals included altered reflex and motor skill development, mild withdrawal, and altered responsiveness to morphine persisting into adulthood.</p>
<p>Morphine sulfate should be used by a pregnant woman only if the need for opiate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> clearly outweighs the potential risks to the fetus.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">In studies of epidural administration of morphine sulfate injection, small amounts of morphine were detected in breast milk. The degree to which morphine sulfate is excreted in human milk following administration of DepoDur has not been studied. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from morphine, a decision should be made whether or not to allow nursing during the first 48 hours following DepoDur administration.</p>

<h2>Use in the Elderly</h2>
<p class="First">DepoDur was studied in clinical trials of 876 subjects; 222 were 65 years of age and older, and 43 of these patients were 75 years of age and over. The efficacy and opiate adverse event profiles in these elderly patients, at the same or lower dose of DepoDur, were similar to those in younger adults (see <a href="#A3C3ABA2-BD76-47B9-88AE-AECC05533380">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>). However, elderly patients (65 years of age or older) may have increased sensitivity to morphine. Comorbid conditions may predispose the elderly population to serious adverse events such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="193518" conceptname="Intestinal obstruction">ileus</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span>.</p>
<p>In general, caution should be exercised in the selection of the dose of DepoDur for an elderly patient. Dosing normally should be at the low end of the range.</p>
<p>DepoDur should be administered to elderly patients (&gt;65 years) after careful evaluation of their underlying medical condition and consideration of the risks associated with DepoDur. Provision for vigilant perioperative monitoring should be arranged for elderly patients receiving DepoDur.</p>

<h1>DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></h1>
<p class="First">DepoDur is a μ-agonist opiate and is a Schedule II controlled substance. Morphine, as with other opiates used in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, can be abused and is subject to criminal diversion. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug addiction</span> is characterized by compulsive use, use for non-medical purposes, and continued use despite harm or risk of harm.</p>
<p>As with all potent μ-agonist opiates, tolerance as well as psychological and physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> to morphine may develop irrespective of the route of administration (intravenous, intramuscular, intrathecal, epidural or oral). Tolerance is a condition in which previous exposure to an opiate results in the necessity for increasingly larger doses of the drug in order to produce the same degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>. Withdrawal symptoms, indicating the presence of psychophysiological <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>, may occur when morphine is discontinued abruptly after chronic administration for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, or upon administration of a drug with full or partial opiate antagonist effects. Care must be taken to avert withdrawal in patients who have been maintained on parenteral/oral opiates prior to epidural administration of DepoDur.</p>
<p>Individuals with a history of opiate or other <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4279309" conceptname="Substance abuse">substance abuse</span> would be considered to be at greater risk of addiction or abuse, given that they are more apt to respond to the euphorigenic and reinforcing properties of morphine. However, concerns about abuse, addiction or diversion of opiates should not prevent proper management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>.</p>
<p>DepoDur is intended for epidural use only. Abuse of DepoDur may pose a hazard of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> when administered through other routes.

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Overdosage of morphine is characterized by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, with or without concomitant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span>.

The conditions that might cause an overdosage situation may vary from patient to patient. A DepoDur dose that is within the labeled dosing guidelines may be found to be more than could be tolerated by an individual patient. During post-marketing experience, spontaneous cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317109" conceptname="Respiratory arrest">respiratory arrest</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</span> have been reported after administration of labeled DepoDur doses (see <a href="#B9821E4C-4C45-44D3-B6E3-AC00F1E235CE">WARNINGS</a> and <a href="#EBE36C39-0887-4A2B-8503-EC452BDCB9F6">ADVERSE EVENTS</a>). Since <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317109" conceptname="Respiratory arrest">respiratory arrest</span> may result either through direct <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> of the respiratory center or as the result of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306572" conceptname="Hypoxia">hypoxia</span>, attention should primarily be given to the establishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Opiates administered in addition to DepoDur to manage <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> may precipitate or worsen adverse events such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>. Additional opiates should be administered with caution.</p>
<p>The opiate antagonist, naloxone, is a specific antidote. An initial dose of 0.4 to 2 mg of naloxone should be administered intravenously, simultaneously with respiratory resuscitation. If the desired degree of counteraction and improvement in respiratory function is not obtained, naloxone may be repeated at 2- to 3-minute intervals. If no response is observed after 10 mg of naloxone has been administered, the diagnosis of opiate-induced, or partial opiate-induced, toxicity should be questioned. Intramuscular or subcutaneous administration may be used if the intravenous route is not available.</p>
<p>As the duration of effect of naloxone is considerably shorter than that of DepoDur, repeated administration or continuous infusion of naloxone may be necessary. Patients should be closely observed for evidence of recurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">DepoDur is intended only for lumbar epidural administration prior to surgery or after clamping of the umbilical cord during cesarean section. DepoDur may be administered via needle or catheter at the lumbar level. Administration of DepoDur at the thoracic level or higher is not recommended because it has not been studied. DepoDur may be administered undiluted or may be diluted up to 5 mL total volume with PRESERVATIVE-FREE 0.9% normal saline.</p>
<p>Vials of DepoDur should be gently inverted to re-suspend the particles immediately prior to withdrawal from the vial. Avoid aggressive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>. No further reconstitution or dilution is required.</p>
<p>For major orthopedic surgery of the lower extremity the recommended dose of DepoDur is 15 mg. For lower abdominal or pelvic surgery, the recommended dose of DepoDur is 10-15 mg. Some patients may benefit from a 20-mg dose of DepoDur, but the incidence of serious adverse respiratory events was dose-related in clinical trials. For cesarean section, the recommended dose is 10 mg.</p>
<p>DepoDur should be administered to elderly patients (&gt;65 years) after careful evaluation of their underlying medical condition and consideration of the risks associated with DepoDur. Vigilant perioperative monitoring should be exercised for elderly patients receiving DepoDur. In general, as with all opiates, the dose for elderly or debilitated patients should be at the low end of the dosing range.</p>
<p>While DepoDur is indicated for women undergoing cesarean section following clamping of the umbilical cord, DepoDur should not be administered to women for vaginal labor and delivery.</p>
<p>The safety and effectiveness of DepoDur in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established and use in this population is not recommended.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">DepoDur should be administered by or under the direct supervision of a physician experienced in the technique of epidural administration and who is thoroughly familiar with the risks associated with the drug product. It should be administered only in settings where there is adequate patient monitoring. Resuscitative equipment and a specific antagonist (naloxone injection) should be immediately available for the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>. Patient monitoring should be continued for at least 48 hours after dosing, as delayed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> may occur (see <a href="#B9821E4C-4C45-44D3-B6E3-AC00F1E235CE">WARNINGS</a>).</span></p>
<p>Improper placement of a needle or catheter in the epidural space should be ruled out before DepoDur is injected. Techniques to detect improper placement of a needle or catheter include: a) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span> to check for the presence of blood or cerebrospinal fluid and/or b) administration of a 3-mL test dose of 1.5% PRESERVATIVE-FREE lidocaine and epinephrine (1:200,000). If a test dose is administered, the patient should be observed for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span> or sudden onset of segmental anesthesia, indicating that intrathecal injection has occurred. To minimize a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interaction</span> of DepoDur with the test dose, flush the epidural catheter with 1 mL of PRESERVATIVE-FREE 0.9% normal saline and wait at least 15 minutes after administration of the test dose.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Do not mix DepoDur with any other medications. Once DepoDur has been administered, no other medication should be administered into the epidural space for at least 48 hours.</span><br></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Do not use an in-line filter during administration of DepoDur.</span><br></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Although DepoDur is a sterile agent, it does not contain any bacteriostatic agents. Therefore, DepoDur must be administered within 4 hours after withdrawal from the vial. Do not heat-sterilize or gas-sterilize.</span><br></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Discard any unused portion in a manner appropriate for Schedule II substances.</span><br></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">PROTECT DEPODUR FROM FREEZING. DO NOT ADMINISTER DEPODUR IF IT IS SUSPECTED THAT THE VIAL HAS BEEN FROZEN.</span></span></p>

<h1>SAFETY AND HANDLING INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">DepoDur consists of morphine encapsulated in multivesicular lipid-based particles that pose no known risk of handling to healthcare workers. Vials of DepoDur should be gently inverted to re-suspend the particles immediately prior to withdrawal from the vial.</p>
<p>Each vial of DepoDur contains a potent opiate that has been associated with abuse and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> among health care providers. Appropriate measures should be taken to control this product within the hospital or clinic including rigid accounting, rigorous control of wastage, and restricted access.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Protect DepoDur from freezing. Do not administer DepoDur if it is suspected that the vial has been frozen. </span>Each carton of DepoDur includes a freeze indicator that should be checked prior to administration of the product. Do not administer DepoDur, if the bulb of the freeze indicator has changed from clear to pink or purple, as this indicates that the product may have frozen. Freezing may adversely affect the modified release mechanism of DepoDur.</p>
<p>As a convenience to the hospital pharmacist, each carton of DepoDur includes pharmacy stickers for noting when each vial has been removed from refrigeration and advising to resuspend just prior to use. Following withdrawal from the vial DepoDur may be held at 15° to 30°C (59° to 86°F) for up to 4 hours prior to administration.</p>
