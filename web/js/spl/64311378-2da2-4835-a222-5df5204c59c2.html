<h1><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION
</span></h1>
<p class="First">PRUDOXIN (doxepin hydrochloride) Cream, 5% is a topical cream. Each gram contains: 50 mg of doxepin hydrochloride (equivalent to 44.3 mg of doxepin). </p>
<p>Doxepin hydrochloride is one of a class of agents known as dibenzoxepin tricyclic antidepressant compounds. It is an isomeric mixture of N,N-dimethyldibenz[<span class="Italics">b,e</span>]oxepin-Î”<span class="Sup">11(6H),Î³</span>-propylamine hydrochloride. Doxepin hydrochloride has an empirical formula of C<span class="Sub">19</span>H<span class="Sub">21</span>NOâ€¢HCl and a molecular weight of 316.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</span></h1>
<p class="First">Although doxepin HCl does have H1 and H2 histamine receptor blocking actions, the exact mechanism by which doxepin exerts its antipruritic effect is unknown. PRUDOXIN Cream can produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> which may reduce awareness, including awareness of pruritic symptoms. In 19 pruritic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133835" conceptname="Eczema">eczema</span> patients treated with PRUDOXIN Cream, plasma doxepin concentrations ranged from nondetectable to 47 ng/mL from percutaneous absorption. Plasma levels from topical application of PRUDOXIN Cream can result in CNS and other systemic side effects.</p>
<p>Once absorbed into the systemic circulation, doxepin undergoes hepatic metabolism that results in conversion to pharmacologically-active desmethyldoxepin. Further glucuronidation results in urinary excretion of the parent drug and its metabolites. Desmethyldoxepin has a half-life that ranges from 28 to 52 hours and is not affected by multiple dosing. Plasma levels of both doxepin and desmethyldoxepin are highly variable and are poorly correlated with dosage. Wide distribution occurs in body tissues including lungs, heart, brain, and liver. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">Renal disease</span>, genetic factors, age, and other medications affect the metabolism and subsequent elimination of doxepin.

<h2><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions
</span></h2>
<p class="First">Studies have not been performed examining drug interactions with PRUDOXIN Cream. However, since plasma levels of doxepin following topical application of PRUDOXIN Cream can reach levels obtained with oral doxepin HCl therapy, the following drug interactions are possible following topical PRUDOXIN Cream application:</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6:</span> The biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase) is reduced in a subset of the Caucasian population (about 7-10% of Caucasians are so-called "poor metabolizers"); reliable estimates of the prevalence of reduced P450 2D6 isozyme activity among Asian, African and other populations are not yet available. Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) when given usual doses. Depending on the fraction of drug metabolized by P450 2D6, the increase in plasma concentration may be small, or quite large (8-fold increase in plasma AUC of the TCA).</p>
<p>In addition, certain drugs inhibit the activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers. An individual who is stable on a given dosage regimen of a TCA may become abruptly toxic when given one of these inhibiting drugs as concomitant therapy. The drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 include some that are not metabolized by the enzyme (quinidine; cimetidine) and many that are substrates for P450 2D6 (many other antidepressants, phenothiazines, and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide). While all the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine, inhibit P450 2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition. The extent to which SSRI-TCA interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the co-administration of TCAs with any of the SSRIs. Of particular importance, sufficient time must elapse before initiating TCA treatment in a patient being withdrawn from fluoxetine, given the long half-life of the parent and active metabolite (at least 5 weeks may be necessary).</p>
<p>Concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the tricyclic antidepressant or the other drug. It is desirable to monitor TCA plasma levels whenever a TCA is going to be co-administered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">MAO Inhibitors:</span> Serious side effects and even <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> have been reported following the concomitant use of certain drugs with MAO inhibitors. Therefore, MAO inhibitors should be discontinued at least two weeks prior to the cautious initiation of therapy with PRUDOXIN Cream. The exact length of time may vary and is dependent upon the particular MAO inhibitor being used, the length of time it has been administered, and the dosage involved.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Cimetidine:</span> Serious anticholinergic symptoms (i.e., severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226991" conceptname="Aptyalism">dry mouth</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192450" conceptname="Retention of urine">urinary retention</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079185" conceptname="Hazy vision">blurred vision</span>) have been associated with elevations in the serum levels of tricyclic antidepressant when cimetidine therapy is initiated. Additionally, higher than expected tricyclic antidepressant levels have been observed when they are begun in patients already taking cimetidine.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Alcohol:</span> Alcohol ingestion may exacerbate the potential sedative effects of PRUDOXIN Cream. This is especially important in patients who may use alcohol excessively.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Tolazamide:</span> A case of severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> has been reported in a type II diabetic patient maintained on tolazamide (1 gm/day) 11 days after the addition of oral doxepin (75 mg/day).</p>

<p class="First">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility studies have not been conducted with doxepin hydrochloride.</p>
<p>Pregnancy Category B: Reproduction studies have been performed in which doxepin was orally administered to rats and rabbits at doses up to 0.6 and 1.2 times, respectively, the estimated exposure to doxepin that results from use of 16 grams of PRUDOXIN Cream per day (four applications of four grams of cream per day; dose multiples reflect comparisons made following normalization of the data on the basis of body surface area estimates) and have revealed no evidence of harm to rat or rabbit fetuses due to doxepin. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Geriatric Use
</span></h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of PRUDOXIN Cream did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>
<p>The extent of renal excretion of doxepin has not been determined. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selections.</p>
<p>Sedating drugs may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> and oversedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be observed closely for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> and oversedation when started on PRUDOXIN Cream.

<p class="First"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Deaths</span> may occur from overdosage with this class of drugs. As the management is complex and changing, it is recommended that the physician contact a poison control center for current information on treatment.

<h2><span class="Bold">Manifestations
</span></h2>
<p class="First">Should overdosage with topical application of PRUDOXIN Cream occur, the signs and symptoms may include: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac dysrhythmias</span>, severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span>, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>. Changes in the electrocardiogram, particularly in QRS axis or width, are clinically significant indicators of tricyclic antidepressant toxicity.</p>
<p>Other signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> may include: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, disturbed concentration, transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275889" conceptname="Visual hallucinations">visual hallucinations</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4290615" conceptname="Dilated pupil">dilated pupils</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">hyperactive</span> reflexes, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4229897" conceptname="Stupor">stupor</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4050941" conceptname="Muscle rigidity">muscle rigidity</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435371" conceptname="Hypothermia">hypothermia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260205" conceptname="Hyperpyrexia">hyperpyrexia</span>, or any of the symptoms listed under <a href="#b6261187-a595-40dd-b74d-f993ff85580a">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">General Recommendations
</span></h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">General:</span> Obtain an ECG and immediately initiate cardiac monitoring. Protect the patient's airway, establish an intravenous line and initiate gastric decontamination. A minimum of six hours of observation with cardiac monitoring and observation for signs of CNS or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac dysrhythmias</span> and/or conduction blocks, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> is strongly advised. If signs of toxicity occur at any time during this period, extended monitoring is recommended. There are case reports of patients succumbing to fatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">dysrhythmias</span> late after <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>; these patients had clinical evidence of significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">poisoning</span> prior to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> and most received inadequate gastrointestinal decontamination. Monitoring of plasma drug levels should not guide management of the patient.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular:</span> A maximal limb-lead QRS duration of &gt;/=0.10 seconds may be the best indication of the severity of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. Intravenous sodium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span> should be used to maintain the serum pH in the range of 7.45 to 7.55. If the pH response is inadequate, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316814" conceptname="Hyperventilation">hyperventilation</span> may also be used. Concomitant use of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316814" conceptname="Hyperventilation">hyperventilation</span> and sodium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span> should be done with extreme caution, with frequent pH monitoring. A pH&gt;7.60 or a pCO<span class="Sub">2</span> &lt;20 mm Hg is undesirable. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">Dysrhythmias</span> unresponsive to sodium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span> therapy/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316814" conceptname="Hyperventilation">hyperventilation</span> may respond to lidocaine, bretylium or phenytoin. Type 1A and 1C antiarrhythmics are generally contraindicated (e.g., quinidine, disopyramide, and procainamide).</p>
<p>In rare instances, hemoperfusion may be beneficial in acute refractory cardiovascular instability in patients with acute toxicity. However, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, exchange transfusions, and forced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span> generally have been reported as ineffective in tricyclic antidepressant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">poisoning</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">CNS:</span> In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span>, early intubation is advised because of the potential for abrupt deterioration. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">Seizures</span> should be controlled with benzodiazepines, or if these are ineffective, other anticonvulsants (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin). Physostigmine is not recommended except to treat life-threatening symptoms that have been unresponsive to other therapies, and then only in consultation with a poison control center.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Pediatric Management:</span> The principles of management of child and adult overdosages are similar. It is strongly recommended that the physician contact the local poison control center for specific pediatric treatment.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</span></h1>
<p class="First">A thin film of PRUDOXIN Cream should be applied four times each day with at least a 3 to 4 hour interval between applications. There are no data to establish the safety and effectiveness of PRUDOXIN Cream when used for greater than 8 days. Chronic use beyond eight days may result in higher systemic levels and should be avoided. Use of PRUDOXIN Cream for longer than 8 days may result in an increased likelihood of contact sensitization.</p>
<p>The risk for sedation may increase with greater body surface area application of PRUDOXIN Cream (See <a href="#b88b9637-2b18-4cea-88e7-b6ff3bd4a138">WARNINGS</a> section). Clinical experience has shown that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> is significantly more common in patients applying PRUDOXIN Cream to over 10% of body surface area; therefore, patients with greater than 10% of body surface area (see <a href="#b88b9637-2b18-4cea-88e7-b6ff3bd4a138">WARNINGS</a> section) affected should be particularly cautioned concerning possible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> and other systemic adverse effects of doxepin. If excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> occurs, it may be necessary to do one or more of the following: reduce the body surface area treated, reduce the number of applications per day, reduce the amount of cream applied, or discontinue the drug.</p>
<p>Occlusive dressings may increase the absorption of most topical drugs; therefore, occlusive dressings should not be utilized with PRUDOXIN Cream.</p>
