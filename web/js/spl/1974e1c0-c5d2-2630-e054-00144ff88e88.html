<h1><span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</span></h1>
<p class="First">Standardized Grass Pollen Extracts are indicated for the skin-test diagnosis of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergy</span> and immunotherapy treatment of patients with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergy</span> to the respective pollen. The diagnosis of IgE-mediated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergy</span> may be established by the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergy</span> history, clinical evaluation, and skin test reactivity.8,11,15 Extracts at 10,000 BAU/mL are indicated for use in scratch, prick, or puncture skin test diagnosis. Extracts at 100,000 BAU/mL are indicated for use in scratch, prick, or puncture skin test diagnosis in less sensitive subjects, such as those negative or indeterminate upon scratch, prick, or puncture testing at 10,000 BAU/mL. Extracts at 10,000 BAU/mL or 100,000 BAU/mL are indicated for intradermal skin test diagnosis only when appropriately diluted.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Immunotherapy with Standardized Grass Pollen Extracts is indicated when testing and patient history have identified the offending allergens and when it is not possible or practical to avoid these allergens.16-18 Extracts at 10,000 BAU/mL or 100,000 BAU/mL are indicated for immunotherapy only when appropriately diluted. 10,000 BAU/mL extracts are indicated for immunotherapy on previously untreated patients. 100,000 BAU/mL extracts are indicated if a higher dose is needed. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION) STANDARDIZED GRASS POLLEN EXTRACTS LABELED IN BAU/mL ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE WITH GRASS POLLEN EXTRACTS LABELED IN AU/mL OR WITH NONSTANDARDIZED GRASS POLLEN.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>EXTRACTS. The use of Standardized Grass Pollen Extracts for the above purposes should be made only by physicians with special familiarity and knowledge of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergy</span>.

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - CONTINUED</h1>
<p class="First">Specific immunotherapy with pollen extracts as employed for many years is helpful in reducing symptoms associated with exposure to the offending allergens. A summary of effectiveness by the Panel on Review of Allergenic Extracts, an advisory committee to the U. S. Food and Drug Administration, has been published.12 Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the effectiveness of immunotherapy: an increase in antigen-specific IgG antibodies is frequently associated with clinical effectiveness, although correlation is not consistent in all studies; there is a decrease in specific IgE; and IgE production is suppressed during periods of seasonal or high exposure to the antigen.13 Other changes following immunotherapy have been noted including development of auto-anti-idiotypic antibodies, a decrease in blood basophil sensitivity to allergen, a decrease in lymphokine production and lymphocyte proliferation by cells exposed to allergen, and development of allergen-specific suppressor cells.14 The complete mechanisms of immunotherapy are not known and remain the subject of investigation.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Standardized versus nonstandardized extracts: Standardized grass pollen extracts cannot be directly compared to the previously marketed nonstandardized extract concentrates of the same grass pollens such as those labeled at 1:10 w/v or 1:20 w/v or at 20,000 to 40,000 PNU. The potency of the nonstandardized extracts vary from species to species. Some nonstandardized grass pollen concentrates have been from a few thousand BAU/mL to several hundred thousand BAU/mL as measured by in vitro ELISA testing. Extracts of some lots of Greer nonstandardized glycerinated 1:20 w/v extracts such as Meadow Fescue and Redtop have tested over 200,000 BAU/mL. Two Timothy aqueous nonstandardized 1:10 w/v aqueous extract lots were over 200,000 BAU/mL. Several lots of nonstandardized concentrates of Kentucky Blue/June, Orchard, Perennial Rye, and Sweet Vernal varied around 100,000 BAU/mL. Bermuda grass is not as potent. The FDA Bermuda reference is assigned 10,000 BAU/mL, a value similar to that found in several Greer lots of nonstandardized Bermuda. This is the maximum available strength of standardized Bermuda grass pollen extract. See TABLE 3 for examples of BAU potency by in vitro ELISA testing for nonstandardized grass pollen extracts.</p>

<p>Extracts testing between 67,300 and 148,600 are not statistically different from 100,000 BAU/mL. Extracts which test between 6,730 to 14,860 are not statistically different from 10,000 BAU/mL.</p>
<p></p>
<p>*CAUTION: Only a few lots of each nonstandardized pollen species have been tested by ELISA. The lots tested varied from fresh extracts to extracts more than three years old. Do not assume that these values apply to specific lots that are in distribution. In addition to age, storage temperatures influence potency.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Physicians must exercise care in switching patients from nonstandardized to standardized extracts. As with nonstandardized extracts, dosage with BAU extracts must be derived based on the patientâ€™s sensitivity to the specific pollen. Switching from an extract that was not standardized in BAU cannot be made by a calculated, numerical ratio, but TABLE 3 can be used as a guide. Dose selection can be confirmed by side-by-side testing of nonstandardized and standardized extracts at estimated equal doses. See WARNINGS section.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The potency of nonstandardized grass pollen extracts have varied enough so that the strength of any extract previously used in a specific patient cannot be related to a particular potency in switching to BAU extracts. Therefore, patients being switched from nonstandardized extracts from another manufacturer to extracts standardized in BAU can be reevaluated by diagnostic skin testing to judge the dose to start immunotherapy or to build up to new maintenance dosages.</p>

<h2><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Diagnostic Testing</span></span></h2>
<p class="First">For the patient with a suspected diagnosis of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergy</span> to more than one antigen, initial screening skin tests should include the individual extracts. If a screening skin test with a mixture is used, a positive response should be followed by testing with the individual extracts to determine the degree of sensitivity to each and to guide in the selection of extracts and their concentration for immunotherapy if indicated. However, because a negative skin test with a mixture may not be indicative of the absence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergy</span> to one or more of the components due to their dilution, testing with individual extracts is more precise. False negative responses may occur if serum levels of antihistamines remain from prior medication administration. (See PRECAUTIONS) The use of a histamine positive control is especially recommended for patients on prior medications which may decrease the histamine skin test response.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Skin tests read after 15 to 20 minutes are graded in terms of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4165876" conceptname="Induration">induration</span> (wheal) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span> (flare) response compared to the appropriate controls. Wheal and flare sizes may be recorded by actual measurements. The largest diameter of the wheal and flare may be recorded, or the sum of the largest diameter and the orthogonal (right angle) diameter wheal or flare may be used as in the studies in TABLE 1 and TABLE 2.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Scratch or Prick-puncture Skin Testing:</p>
<p>For puncture, prick, or scratch skin test, the 10,000 BAU/mL strength is recommended and will detect the more sensitive patients. Inconclusive results at 10,000 BAU/mL may be followed by a puncture, prick, or scratch skin test at 100,000. At the higher concentration, some nonspecific positives may occur.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Controls for Scratch, Prick-Puncture Testing:</p>
<p>As a positive control, glycerinated histamine phosphate 5 mg/mL (1.8 mg/mL histamine base) or aqueous histamine phosphate 2.75 mg/mL (1 mg/mL (1:1,000 w/v) histamine base) may be used as a positive control. A 50% glycerosaline solution may be used as the negative control.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Intradermal Skin Testing:</p>
<p>Extracts for intradermal testing must be prepared by diluting the concentrated extract with sterile diluent (such as normal or buffered saline, or normal saline with human serum albumin).</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Intradermal skin tests with eight U.S. reference extracts (TABLE 2) indicate that a calculated dose of 0.02 BAU/mL should yield an average sum of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span> reaction of 50 mm, as tested in subjects with similar puncture reactivities described in TABLE 1 to that specific grass pollen extract. However in the more sensitive subjects, the dose was as low as 0.0003 BAU for one grass to 0.002 BAU for several others. Conversely, doses of from 0.1 to 1.9 BAU were calculated to yield the same reaction in the least-sensitive subjects.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Controls for Intradermal Testing:</p>
<p>As a positive control, use glycerinated histamine phosphate diluted to 0.5 mg/mL (0.18 mg/mL histamine base) or aqueous histamine phosphate 0.275 mg/mL (0.1 mg/mL histamine base). As a negative control, use 0.5% to 1% glycerin in 0.9% saline.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A. Patients with a negative scratch or prick-puncture test:</p>
<p>Patients who do not react to a scratch or prick-puncture test should be tested intradermally, using a 26 or 27 gauge 1/4 inch needle, with 0.02 to 0.05 mL of a 50 BAU/mL extract dilution. A negative test should be followed by repeat tests using progressively stronger concentrations until significant wheal and flare reaction sizes are attained or until the maximum recommended strength of 200 BAU/mL is reached. As a positive control, use glycerinated histamine phosphate diluted to 0.5 mg/mL (0.18 mg/mL histamine base) or aqueous histamine phosphate 0.275 mg/mL (0.1 mg/mL histamine base). As a negative control use 0.5% to 1% glycerosaline solution.</p>
<p>B. Patients tested only by the intradermal method:</p>
<p>Since highly reactive individuals may react intracutaneously at doses even smaller than indicated above, it is recommended that intradermal testing be preceded by a puncture test and the dose adjusted accordingly. Other patients suspected of being moderately allergic may be tested with an intradermal test dose of 0.02 to 0.05 mL of a 0.05 BAU/mL dilution. A negative test should be followed by repeat tests using progressively stronger concentrations until the maximum recommended strength of 200 BAU/mL is reached. As a negative control use 0.5% to 1% glycerosaline solution. As a positive control, use glycerinated histamine phosphate diluted to 0.5 mg/mL (0.18 mg/mL histamine base) or aqueous histamine phosphate 0.275 mg/mL (0.1 mg/mL histamine base).</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span></h1>
<p class="First">Systemic reactions are uncommon after injection, but if the patient receives more extract than can be tolerated at that particular time and begins to experience <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223759" conceptname="IgE-mediated allergic disorder">immediate hypersensitivity</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylaxis</span>, the procedures listed under ADVERSE REACTIONS should be instituted.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Overdosage may occur because of an error in the volume of extract injected, an incorrect dilution injected, or because the patient may be exposed to airborne or environmental antigens simultaneously with injection of the same antigens. In the event of a systemic reaction occurring, the dosage schedule should be carefully reviewed and if necessary adjusted as outlined above under WARNINGS.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span></h1>
<p class="First">There are no known absolute contraindications to the use of Standardized Grass Pollen Extracts for immunotherapy. Immunotherapy with specific antigens is contraindicated in those individuals who do not exhibit skin test and clinical sensitivity to the particular antigens. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS)</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Allergenic extract injections should not be administered in the presence of diseases characterized by a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> diathesis.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Children with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="195314" conceptname="Nephrotic syndrome">nephrotic syndrome</span> require careful consideration and probably should not receive injection therapy because a variety of seemingly unrelated events, such as immunization, can cause an exacerbation of their nephrotic disease. General contraindications include:</p>
<p></p>
<p>EXTREME SENSITIVITY TO THE SPECIFIC ALLERGEN - Determined from previous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylaxis</span> following exposure.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span></h1>
<p class="First">All concentrates of Standardized Grass Pollen Extracts are manufactured to assure high potency and have the ability during skin testing and immunotherapy to cause serious local and systemic reactions including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> in extremely sensitive patients. Most reactions occur within 20 minutes after injection, but may occur later.19 To minimize the potential for local or systemic reactions, the relative sensitivity of the patient must be assessed from the allergic history and from clinical observations. Patients should be informed of these risks prior to skin testing and immunotherapy. (See PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Concentrated extracts at 10,000 and 100,000 BAU/mL, must be diluted with a sterile diluent prior to use in a patient for intradermal testing or for immunotherapy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Skin testing should be initiated only with 10,000 BAU/mL extracts. If several concentrated extracts at 100,000 BAU/mL are administered concurrently to a sensitive patient, the additive effects of cross-reacting allergens may cause a systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylactic reaction</span>.</p>
<p>Allergenic extracts should be temporarily withheld from patients or the dose adjusted downward if any of the following conditions exist:</p>
<ol>
<li>severe symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4320791" conceptname="Rhinitis">rhinitis</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span></li>

<li>exposure to excessive amounts of clinically relevant allergen prior to a scheduled injection</li>
<li>evidence of a local or systemic reaction to the preceding extract injection during a course of immunotherapy</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>The dosage must be reduced: 1) when starting a patient on fresh extract; 2) when transferring a patient from another form of extract to a BAU standardized extract; or 3) when modifying dosages or components in a mixture or an individual prescription, even though the labeled strength of the old and new vials may be the same. This reduction in dosage may be necessary: 1) due to the previously used extract having lost potency during storage; 2) due to the fact that standardized extracts labeled in BAU/mL differ in potency in comparison to nonstandardized extracts of the same species (see TABLE 3); or 3) due to different patient sensitivity to different components. The amount of new extract given should not exceed 25% of the last dose given from the old vial, assuming both extracts contain comparable amounts of allergen. Any evidence of a local or generalized reaction requires a reduction in dosage during the initial stages of immunotherapy, as well as during maintenance therapy. The information about nonstandardized extracts shown in TABLE 3 may be helpful in confirming the appropriateness of the initial dose. When a patient is first being administered a standardized extract labeled in BAU/mL, the new dose can be selected based on a side-by-side comparison with the previously used nonstandardized extract. The availability of 10,000 BAU/mL and 100,000 BAU/mL doses is intended to facilitate safe switching by providing the physicians access to lower and higher dosages.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Patients receiving beta blocker drugs may not be responsive to beta adrenergic drugs used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylaxis</span>. The risks of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylaxis</span> in these patients should be carefully weighed against the benefits of immunotherapy.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Patients receiving allergenic extracts should be kept under observation a minimum of twenty20 minutes so that any adverse reaction can be observed and properly handled.22 This time should be extended to at least 30 minutes for high-risk patients such as those with labile or steroid-dependent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> or those suffering an exacerbation of their symptoms.32 Airway obstruction in high risk patients can be monitored by peak flow measurements before and after administration of allergens.</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Adverse systemic reactions may occur within minutes upon use of an allergenic extract to which a person has specific sensitivity. These reactions consist primarily of allergic symptoms such as generalized <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">skin erythema</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="139900" conceptname="Urticaria">urticaria</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432791" conceptname="Angioedema">angioedema</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4320791" conceptname="Rhinitis">rhinitis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314754" conceptname="Wheezing">wheezing</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="22350" conceptname="Edema of larynx">laryngeal edema</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>. Less commonly, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal cramps</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span> and uterine contractions may occur. Systemic reactions occur with varying frequency in different clinics and are usually less than 1%. To some extent, the reaction rate is related to the type and dose of administered extract and to the degree of sensitivity of the patient. Severe reactions may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372448" conceptname="Loss of consciousness">loss of consciousness</span>. Fatalities have occurred rarely.12,26,27 Fatal reactions are often associated with high-risk patients such as those with labile or steroid-dependent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>, particularly in those suffering an exacerbation of their symptoms at the time of extract administration. In general, immunotherapy with allergenic extracts is considered to be safe.28 Despite all precautions occasional reactions are unavoidable.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Adverse systemic / <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylactic reactions</span> should be treated as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>A. If the injection site is an arm, a tourniquet should be immediately applied above the site. Release the tourniquet every few minutes for a few</p>
<p>seconds.</p>
<p>B. Epinephrine 1:1000 should be injected immediately in the opposite arm in amounts of 0.3 to 0.5 mL and 0.2 mL epinephrine should be</p>
<p>administered at the site of injection. For children below the age of 6 years, adjust the initial dose of epinephrine to 0.005 mL per pound</p>
<p>(0.01 mL/kg) of body weight. Repeat epinephrine dosage in 15 minutes if necessary and if symptoms persist.</p>
<p>C. Adverse reactions not responding to epinephrine therapy may require other measures such as the use of inhaled, parenteral bronchodilators,</p>
<p>vasopressors, oxygen, or volume replacement therapy. Proper equipment and trained personnel should be available.20,21,31</p>
<p></p>
<p>Local reactions consisting of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302654" conceptname="Itching">itching</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4082445" conceptname="Tenderness">tenderness</span> and sometimes <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> may occur at the injection site. These reactions may appear within a few minutes to hours and persist for several days. Local <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">cold</span> applications and oral antihistamines may be effective treatment. For marked and prolonged local reactions, steroids may be helpful.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS</p>
<p></p>
<p>Reporting of serious or unexpected adverse events occurring after extract administration is encouraged. MedWatch Forms, FDA Form 3500, are available from FDA, 1-800-332-1088. Health-care providers also should report these events to the Regulatory Affairs adverse reaction monitor, Greer, P.O. Box 800, Lenoir NC 28645-0800 or call 1-800-438-0088.</p>

<h1>STORAGE AND HANDLING</h1>
<p class="First">All allergenic extracts should be stored at 2-8Â°C and kept in this temperature range during office use. Refer to vial labels for expiration dates. Clinicians should be aware that diluted extracts are inherently less stable than concentrates. Dilutions of glycerinated extracts which result in glycerin below 50% may also be less stable. Potency of a particular dilution can be checked by skin test in comparison to a fresh dilution of the extract on an individual known to be allergic to the specific antigen.</p>
