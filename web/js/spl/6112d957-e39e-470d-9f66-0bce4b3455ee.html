<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<a href="http://"></a><p class="First"></p>
<p>Propranolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent possessing no other autonomic nervous system activity. It specifically competes with beta-adrenergic receptor agonist agents for available receptor sites. When access to beta-receptor sites is blocked by propranolol, the chronotropic, inotropic, and vasodilator responses to beta-adrenergic stimulation are decreased proportionately. At dosages greater than required for beta blockade, propranolol also exerts a quinidine-like or anesthetic-like membrane action, which affects the cardiac action potential. The significance of the membrane action in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span> is uncertain.</p>

<p>The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of propranolol has not been established. Factors that may contribute to the antihypertensive action include: (1) decreased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span>, (2) inhibition of renin release by the kidneys, and (3) diminution of tonic sympathetic nerve outflow from vasomotor centers in the brain. Although total peripheral resistance may increase initially, it readjusts to or below the pretreatment level with chronic use of propranolol. Effects of propranolol on plasma volume appear to be minor and somewhat variable.</p>
<p>In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321318" conceptname="Angina pectoris">angina pectoris</span>, propranolol generally reduces the oxygen requirement of the heart at any given level of effort by blocking the catecholamine-induced increases in the heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and the velocity and extent of myocardial contraction. Propranolol may increase oxygen requirements by increasing left ventricular fiber length, end diastolic pressure, and systolic ejection period. The net physiologic effect of betaadrenergic blockade is usually advantageous and is manifested during exercise by delayed onset of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> and increased work capacity.</p>
<p>Propranolol exerts its antiarrhythmic effects in concentrations associated with beta-adrenergic blockade, and this appears to be its principal antiarrhythmic mechanism of action. In dosages greater than required for beta blockade, propranolol also exerts a quinidine-like or anesthetic-like membrane action, which affects the cardiac action potential. The significance of the membrane action in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span> is uncertain.</p>
<p>The mechanism of the antimigraine effect of propranolol has not been established. Beta-adrenergic receptors have been demonstrated in the pial vessels of the brain.</p>
<p>The specific mechanism of propranololâ€™s antitremor effects has not been established, but beta-2 (noncardiac) receptors may be involved. A central effect is also possible. Clinical studies have demonstrated that propranolol is of benefit in exaggerated physiological and essential (familial) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span>.</p>

<p>Propranolol is highly lipophilic and almost completely absorbed after oral administration. However, it undergoes high first-pass metabolism by the liver and on average, only about 25% of propranolol reaches the systemic circulation. Peak plasma concentrations occur about 1 to 4 hours after an oral dose.</p>
<p>Administration of protein-rich foods increase the bioavailability of propranolol by about 50% with no change in time to peak concentration, plasma binding, half-life, or the amount of unchanged drug in the urine.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p></p>
<p>Approximately 90% of circulating propranolol is bound to plasma proteins (albumin and alpha<span class="Sub">1</span> acid glycoprotein). The binding is enantiomer-selective. The S(-)-enantiomer is preferentially bound to alpha<span class="Sub">1</span> glycoprotein and the R(+)-enantiomer preferentially bound to albumin. The volume of distribution of propranolol is approximately 4 liters/kg.</p>
<p>Propranolol crosses the blood-brain barrier and the placenta, and is distributed into breast milk.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p></p>
<p>Propranolol is extensively metabolized with most metabolites appearing in the urine. Propranolol is metabolized through three primary routes: aromatic hydroxylation (mainly 4-hydroxylation), N-dealkylation followed by further side-chain oxidation, and direct glucuronidation. It has been estimated that the percentage contributions of these routes to total metabolism are 42%, 41% and 17%, respectively, but with considerable variability between individuals. The four major metabolites are propranolol glucuronide, naphthyloxylactic acid and glucuronic acid, and sulfate conjugates of 4-hydroxy propranolol.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies have indicated that the aromatic hydroxylation of propranolol is catalyzed mainly by polymorphic CYP2D6. Side-chain oxidation is mediated mainly by CYP1A2 and to some extent by CYP2D6. 4-hydroxy propranolol is a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6.</p>
<p>Propranolol is also a substrate of CYP2C19 and a substrate for the intestinal efflux transporter, p-glycoprotein (p-gp). Studies suggest however that p-gp is not dose-limiting for intestinal absorption of propranolol in the usual therapeutic dose range.</p>
<p>In healthy subjects, no difference was observed between CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs) with respect to oral clearance or elimination half-life. Partial clearance of 4-hydroxy propranolol was significantly higher and of naphthyloxyactic acid significantly lower in EMs than PMs.</p>
<p>The plasma half-life of propranolol is from 3 to 6 hours.</p>
<p>
Â 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p></p>
<p>Propranolol is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, R(+) and S(-). The S(-)-enantiomer is approximately 100 times as potent as the R(+)- enantiomer in blocking beta adrenergic receptors. In normal subjects receiving oral doses of racemic propranolol, S(-)-enantiomer concentrations exceeded those of the R(+)-enantiomer by 40-90% as a result of stereoselective hepatic metabolism. Clearance of the pharmacologically active S(-)-propranolol is lower than R(+)-propranolol after intravenous and oral doses.</p>
<p>

<a href="http://"></a><p></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Geriatric</span></p>
<p>In a study of 12 elderly (62 to 79 years old) and 12 young (25 to 33 years old) healthy subjects, the clearance of S(-)-enantiomer of propranolol was decreased in the elderly. Additionally, the half-life of both the R(+)- and S(-)- propranolol were prolonged in the elderly compared with the young (11 hours vs. 5 hours).</p>
<p>Clearance of propranolol is reduced with aging due to decline in oxidation capacity (ring oxidation and side-chain oxidation). Conjugation capacity remains unchanged. In a study of 32 patients age 30 to 84 years given a single 20-mg dose of propranolol, an inverse correlation was found between age and the partial metabolic clearances to 4-hydroxypropranolol (40HP-ring oxidation) and to naphthoxylactic acid (NLA-side chain oxidation). No correlation was found between age and the partial metabolic clearance to propranolol glucuronide (PPLG-conjugation).</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Gender</span></p>
<p>In a study of 9 healthy women and 12 healthy men, neither the administration of testosterone nor the regular course of the menstrual cycle affected the plasma binding of the propranolol enantiomers. In contrast, there was a significant, although non-enantioselective diminution of the binding of propranolol after treatment with ethinyl estradiol. These findings are inconsistent with another study, in which administration of testosterone cypionate confirmed the stimulatory role of this hormone on propranolol metabolism and concluded that the clearance of propranolol in men is dependent on circulating concentrations of testosterone. In women, none of the metabolic clearances for propranolol showed any significant association with either estradiol or testosterone.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Race</span></p>
<p>A study conducted in 12 Caucasian and 13 African-American male subjects taking propranolol, showed that at steady state, the clearance of R(+)- and S(-)-propranolol were about 76% and 53% higher in African-Americans than in Caucasians, respectively.</p>
<p>Chinese subjects had a greater proportion (18% to 45% higher) of unbound propranolol in plasma compared to Caucasians, which was associated with a lower plasma concentration of alpha<span class="Sub">1</span> acid glycoprotein.</p>

Despite this shorter plasma half-life, propranolol peak plasma levels were 3 to 4 times higher and total plasma levels of metabolites were up to 3 times higher in these patients than in subjects with normal renal function.</p>

<p>Propranolol is extensively metabolized by the liver. In a study conducted in 7 patients with cirrhosis and 9 healthy subjects receiving 80-mg oral propranolol every 8 hours for 7 doses, the steady-state unbound propranolol concentration in patients with cirrhosis was increased 3-fold in comparison to controls. In cirrhosis, the half-life increased to 11 hours compared to 4 hours (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_f46cf62b-8042-48ec-b26d-3ccd29a72709">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>).</p>

<p>In dietary administration studies in which mice and rats were treated with propranolol hydrochloride for up to 18 months at doses of up to 150 mg/kg/day, there was no evidence of drug-related tumorigenesis. On a body surface area basis, this dose in the mouse and rat is, respectively, about equal to and about twice the maximum recommended human oral daily dose (MRHD) of 640 mg propranolol hydrochloride. In a study in which both male and female rats were exposed to propranolol hydrochloride in their diets at concentrations of up to 0.05% (about 50 mg/kg body weight and less than the MRHD), from 60 days prior to mating and throughout pregnancy and lactation for two generations, there were no effects on fertility.

<p>Clinical studies of propranolol did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<a href="http://"></a><p class="First"></p>
<p>Propranolol is not significantly dialyzable. In the event of overdosage or exaggerated response, the following measures should be employed:</p>
<p><span class="Underline">General:</span> If ingestion is or may have been recent, evacuate gastric contents, taking care to prevent pulmonary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Supportive Therapy:</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span> have been reported following propranolol <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> and should be treated appropriately. Glucagon can exert potent inotropic and chronotropic effects and may be particularly useful for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> or depressed myocardial function after a propranolol <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. Glucagon should be administered as 50 to 150 mcg/kg intravenously followed by continuous drip of 1 to 5 mg/hour for positive chronotropic effect. Isoproterenol, dopamine or phosphodiesterase inhibitors may also be useful. Epinephrine, however, may provoke <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4269635" conceptname="Hypertensive episode">uncontrolled hypertension</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">Bradycardia</span> can be treated with atropine or isoproterenol. Serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span> may require temporary cardiac pacing.</p>
<p>The electrocardiogram, pulse, blood pressure, neurobehavioral status and intake and output balance must be monitored. Isoproterenol and aminophylline may be used for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256717" conceptname="Bronchospasm">bronchospasm</span>.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<a href="http://"></a><p class="First"></p>
<p><span class="Bold">General</span></p>
<p>Because of the variable bioavailability of propranolol, the dose should be individualized based on response.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">Hypertension</span></span></p>
<p>The usual initial dosage is 40 mg propranolol hydrochloride twice daily, whether used alone or added to a diuretic. Dosage may be increased gradually until adequate blood pressure control is achieved. The usual maintenance dosage is 120 mg to 240 mg per day. In some instances a dosage of 640 mg a day may be required. The time needed for full antihypertensive response to a given dosage is variable and may range from a few days to several weeks.</p>
<p>While twice-daily dosing is effective and can maintain a reduction in blood pressure throughout the day, some patients, especially when lower doses are used, may experience a modest <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="141693" conceptname="Elevated blood-pressure reading without diagnosis of hypertension">rise in blood pressure</span> toward the end of the 12-hour dosing interval. This can be evaluated by measuring blood pressure near the end of the dosing interval to determine whether satisfactory control is being maintained throughout the day. If control is not adequate, a larger dose, or 3-times-daily therapy may achieve better control.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321318" conceptname="Angina pectoris">Angina Pectoris</span></span></p>
<p>Total daily doses of 80 mg to 320 mg propranolol hydrochloride, when administered orally, twice a day, three times a day, or four times a day, have been shown to increase exercise tolerance and to reduce ischemic changes in the ECG. If treatment is to be discontinued, reduce dosage gradually over a period of several weeks. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_aee6f56b-a829-4f1e-9786-a7b2e96bf100">WARNINGS</a></span>.)</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">Atrial Fibrillation</span></span></p>
<p>The recommended dose is 10 mg to 30 mg propranolol hydrochloride three or four times daily before meals and at bedtime.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">Myocardial Infarction</span></span></p>
<p>In the Beta-Blocker <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">Heart Attack</span> Trial (BHAT), the initial dose was 40 mg t.i.d., with titration after 1 month to 60 mg to 80 mg t.i.d. as tolerated. The recommended daily dosage is 180 mg to 240 mg propranolol hydrochloride per day in divided doses. Although a t.i.d. regimen was used in the BHAT and a q.i.d. regimen in the Norwegian Multicenter Trial, there is a reasonable basis for the use of either a t.i.d. or b.i.d. regimen (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#LINK_7f671991-dbd7-446d-b3cd-8de421a752d9">PHARMACODYNAMICS AND CLINICAL EFFECTS</a></span>). The effectiveness and safety of daily dosages greater than 240 mg for prevention of cardiac mortality have not been established. However, higher dosages may be needed to effectively treat coexisting diseases such as angina or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> (see above).</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">Migraine</span></span></p>
<p>The initial dose is 80 mg propranolol hydrochloride daily in divided doses. The usual effective dose range is 160 mg to 240 mg per day. The dosage may be increased gradually to achieve optimum <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318736" conceptname="Migraine">migraine</span> prophylaxis. If a satisfactory response is not obtained within four to six weeks after reaching the maximum dose, propranolol therapy should be discontinued. It may be advisable to withdraw the drug gradually over a period of several weeks.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="43531003" conceptname="Essential tremor">Essential Tremor</span></span></p>
<p>The initial dosage is 40 mg propranolol hydrochloride twice daily. Optimum reduction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="43531003" conceptname="Essential tremor">essential tremor</span> is usually achieved with a dose of 120 mg per day. Occasionally, it may be necessary to administer 240 mg to 320 mg per day.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Hypertrophic Subaortic Stenosis</span></p>
<p>The usual dosage is 20 mg to 40 mg propranolol hydrochloride three or four times daily before meals and at bedtime.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118993" conceptname="Pheochromocytoma">Pheochromocytoma</span></span></p>
<p>The usual dosage is 60 mg propranolol hydrochloride daily in divided doses for three days prior to surgery as adjunctive therapy to alpha-adrenergic blockade. For the management of inoperable tumors, the usual dosage is 30 mg daily in divided doses as adjunctive therapy to alpha-adrenergic blockade.</p>
