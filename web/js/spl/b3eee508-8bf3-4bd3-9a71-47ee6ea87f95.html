<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="First"><span>Synera<span class="Sup">®</span> consists of a thin, uniform layer of a local 
anesthetic formulation with an integrated, oxygen-activated heating component 
that is intended to enhance the delivery of the local anesthetic.  The drug 
formulation is an emulsion in which the oil phase is a eutectic mixture of 
lidocaine 70 mg and tetracaine 70 mg.  The eutectic mixture has a melting point 
below room temperature and therefore exists as a liquid oil rather than as 
crystals.  The surface area of the entire Synera patch is approximately 50 
cm<span class="Sup">2</span>, 10 cm<span class="Sup">2</span> of which is active.</span></p>
<p><span>Lidocaine is chemically designated as acetamide, 
2-(diethylamino)-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl), has an octanol:water partition ratio of 
182 at pH 7.3 and has the following structure:</span></p>
<p><span>MM1</span></p>
<p><img alt="lidocaine" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=b3eee508-8bf3-4bd3-9a71-47ee6ea87f95&amp;name=lidocaine.jpg"></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Tetracaine is chemically designated as 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl 
p-(butylamino)benzoate, has an octanol:water partition ratio of 5370 at pH 7.3 
and has the following structure:</span></p>
<p><span>MM2</span></p>
<p><img alt="tetracaine" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=b3eee508-8bf3-4bd3-9a71-47ee6ea87f95&amp;name=tetracaine.jpg"></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Each Synera patch contains lidocaine 70 mg and tetracaine 70 mg in a 
eutectic mixture.  The Synera formulation also contains the following inactive 
ingredients: polyvinyl alcohol, sorbitan monopalmitate, water, methylparaben and 
propylparaben.</span></p>
<p><span>The Synera heating component generates a mild warming that is 
intended to enhance the delivery of the local anesthetic.  Synera begins to heat 
once the patch is removed from the pouch and is exposed to oxygen in the air.  
Although the patch may increase skin temperature by up to approximately 5ºC, 
maximum skin temperature will not exceed 40ºC.  The heating component is 
composed of iron powder, activated carbon, sodium chloride, wood flour, water 
and filter paper.</span></p>

<h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action:  </span><span>Synera applied to 
intact skin provides local dermal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> by the release of lidocaine and 
tetracaine from the patch into the skin.  Lidocaine is an amide-type local 
anesthetic agent and tetracaine is an ester-type local anesthetic agent.  Both 
lidocaine and tetracaine block sodium ion channels required for the initiation 
and conduction of neuronal impulses, resulting in local anesthesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span>Pharmacokinetics:</span></span><span></span></p>
<p><span class="Underline"><span>Absorption</span></span><span><span>:  The amount of 
lidocaine and tetracaine systemically absorbed from Synera is thought to be 
directly related to the duration of application.  However, this was not clearly 
demonstrated in clinical trials.  Application of one Synera patch for 30 minutes 
in adults produced peak plasma concentrations of lidocaine less than 5 ng/mL 
while plasma levels of tetracaine were below the limit of quantitation 
(</span><span>&lt;0.9 ng/mL) in all subjects tested (n = 12, see Table 1).  Synera 
application up to 60 minutes did not significantly increase plasma levels of 
lidocaine or tetracaine compared to a 30-minute application.</span></span></p>

<p><span>*Estimated absorbed dose was calculated by subtracting the residual amount of drug in each patch from the labeled claim.</span></p>
<p><span>na = not applicable</span></p>
<p><span>The surface area of application was 10 cm<span class="Sup">2</span> per Synera patch.<br></span></p>
<p><span>Application of Synera to broken or inflamed skin, or simultaneous or 
sequential application of multiple Synera patches could result in higher plasma 
levels of local anesthetic that could, in susceptible individuals, produce 
systemic toxicity.</span></p>
<p><span>In general, application of multiple Synera patches either 
simultaneously or sequentially is not recommended.  However, plasma levels of 
lidocaine and tetracaine have been determined in clinical pharmacology studies 
following multiple successive and simultaneous applications of Synera patches on 
intact skin.</span></p>
<p><span>Maximum plasma levels of lidocaine after the application of a) four 
successive Synera patches for 30 minutes each with a 30-minute interval between 
each patch application, and b) three Synera patches for 60 minutes each with a 
60-minute interval between each application were less than 12 ng/mL and 8 ng/mL, 
respectively.  Tetracaine was not detected in plasma following either 
treatment.</span></p>
<p><span>Simultaneous application of two or four Synera patches for 60 minutes 
produced peak plasma concentrations of lidocaine of less than 9 ng/mL, while 
tetracaine plasma concentrations were not detectable in all subjects (n=22).  
Sequential 30-minute applications of four Synera patches at 60-minute intervals 
produced peak plasma concentrations of lidocaine of less than 12 ng/mL, while 
tetracaine plasma concentrations were below the limit of quantitation 
(n=11).</span></p>
<p><span class="Underline"><span>Distribution</span></span><span><span>:  When lidocaine is 
administered intravenously to healthy volunteers, the steady-state volume of 
distribution is approximately 0.8 to 1.3 L/kg.  At lidocaine concentrations 
observed following the recommended product application, approximately 75% of 
lidocaine is bound to plasma proteins, primarily alpha-1-acid glycoprotein.  At 
much higher plasma concentrations (1 to 4 mcg/mL of free base) the plasma 
protein binding of lidocaine is concentration dependent.  Lidocaine crosses the 
placental and blood brain barriers, presumably by passive diffusion.  CNS 
toxicity may typically be observed around 5000 ng/mL of lidocaine; however a 
small number of patients reportedly may show signs of toxicity at approximately 
1000 ng/mL.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Volume of distribution and protein binding have not been determined 
for tetracaine due to rapid hydrolysis in plasma.</span></p>
<p><span class="Underline"><span>Metabolism</span></span><span><span>:  It is not known if 
lidocaine or tetracaine is metabolized in the skin.  Lidocaine is metabolized 
rapidly by the liver to a number of metabolites including 
monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), both of which have 
pharmacologic activity similar to, but less potent than that of lidocaine.  The 
major metabolic pathway of lidocaine, sequential N-deethylation to 
monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), is primarily mediated 
by CYP1A2 with a minor role of CYP3A4. The metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, 
has unknown pharmacologic activity.  Following intravenous administration of 
lidocaine, MEGX and GX concentrations in serum range from 11% to 36% and from 5% 
to 11% of lidocaine concentrations, respectively.  Serum concentrations of MEGX 
were about one-third the serum lidocaine concentrations. </span></span></p>
<p><span>Tetracaine undergoes rapid hydrolysis by plasma esterases. Primary 
metabolites of tetracaine include para-aminobenzoic acid and 
diethylaminoethanol, both of which have an unspecified activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="Underline"><span>Elimination</span></span><span><span>:  The half-life of 
lidocaine elimination from the plasma following intravenous administration is 
approximately 1.8 hr.  Lidocaine and its metabolites are excreted by the 
kidneys.  More than 98% of an absorbed dose of lidocaine can be recovered in the 
urine as metabolites or parent drug.  Less than 10% of lidocaine is excreted 
unchanged in adults, and approximately 20% is excreted unchanged in neonates.  
The systemic clearance is approximately 8-10 mL/min/kg.  During intravenous 
studies, the elimination half-life of lidocaine was statistically significantly 
longer in elderly patients (2.5 hours) than in younger patients (1.5 
hours).</span></span></p>
<p><span>The half-life and clearance for tetracaine have not been established 
for humans, but hydrolysis in the plasma is rapid.</span></p>
<p><span class="Underline"><span>Special Populations</span></span><span></span></p>
<p><span class="Underline"><span>Pediatrics</span></span><span><span>:  Application of one 
Synera patch for up to 30 minutes in children 4 months to 12 years of age (n=18) 
produced maximum peak plasma concentrations of lidocaine and tetracaine of 63 
ng/mL and 65 ng/mL, respectively.  Application of two Synera patches for up to 
30 minutes to children 4 months to 12 years of age (n=19) produced peak 
lidocaine levels of up to 331 ng/mL and tetracaine levels of less than 5 
ng/mL.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="Underline"><span>Elderly</span></span><span><span>:  After application 
of one Synera patch for 20 minutes, plasma levels of lidocaine and tetracaine 
were not detectable in elderly subjects (&gt; 65 years of age, mean 72.0 
</span><span>±</span><span>4.3 years, n=10).  
After simultaneous application of two Synera patches for 60 minutes to elderly 
subjects (&gt; 65 years of age, mean 69.5 </span><span>±</span><span>3.7 years, n=12), the 
maximum peak lidocaine concentration was 6 ng/mL and tetracaine was not 
detectable.  During intravenous studies, the elimination half-life of lidocaine 
was statistically significantly longer in elderly patients (2.5 hours) than in 
younger patients (1.5 hours).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="Underline"><span>Cardiac, Renal and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic Impairment</span></span></span><span><span>:  No specific 
pharmacokinetic studies were conducted.  The half-life of lidocaine may be 
increased in cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.  There is no established half-life 
for tetracaine due to rapid hydrolysis in the plasma.</span></span></p>

<h2>CLINICAL STUDIES</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span>SUPERFICIAL VENOUS ACCESS</span></span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Three randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trials in 
adult and geriatric subjects evaluated the degree of dermal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> upon 
venipuncture following a 20-minute treatment with Synera or a placebo patch 
(patch with heating component but no drug).  In each trial, subjects received 
Synera on one arm and placebo patch on the other. Less <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> was reported 
following Synera treatment compared to placebo in all three studies as measured 
by a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS).  In the first study in 21 subjects, 
median VAS scores for Synera and placebo treatments were 1 and 9, respectively.  
In the second study in 40 subjects, median VAS scores were 5 and 28 for Synera 
and placebo treatments, respectively.  In the third study, in 40 subjects over 
the age of 65 years, median VAS scores for Synera and placebo treatments were 8 
and 14, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span>In a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study, 61 pediatric 
patients received either Synera or placebo for 20 minutes prior to venipuncture 
or IV cannulation in the antecubital fossa or dorsum of the hand.  Subjects were 
stratified by age group (3 to 6 years and 7 to 17 years).  Children in the 
younger group reported less <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> with Synera than with placebo, as rated using a 
six-point Oucher <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> scale with faces.  Children in the older group rated their 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> using a different instrument; an eleven-point Oucher <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> scale that 
contained both faces and numbers.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">Pain</span> scores in the older children treated 
with Synera were not statistically significantly different from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> scores in 
those treated with placebo.</span></p>
<p><span>In a double-blind trial in 250 adults, subjects were randomized to 
receive either Synera without heating element or intact, heated Synera, prior to 
venipuncture.  Less <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> was reported following treatment with the heated Synera 
compared to the non-heated patch.  Median VAS scores for the patch with the 
heating component and without the heating component were 17 and 22, 
respectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span>SUPERFICIAL DERMATOLOGICAL PROCEDURES</span></span><span></span></p>
<p><span>In one randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study, 94 adult 
subjects received either Synera or placebo patch for 30 minutes prior to a 
superficial dermatological procedure such as superficial excision, shave biopsy 
or electrodessication.  Less <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> was reported following Synera treatment 
compared to placebo.  Median VAS scores for Synera and placebo treatments were 5 
and 31, respectively.  In a similarly designed study in 74 subjects over the age 
of 65 years, less <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> was reported following Synera treatment compared to 
placebo with median VAS scores for Synera and placebo treatments of 10 and 23, 
respectively.</span></p>
<p><span>In a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study, 88 pediatric 
patients were stratified by age group (3 to 6 years and 7 to 17 years) to 
receive a 30-minute application of either Synera or placebo, prior to lidocaine 
injection.  In younger children who used the Oucher <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> scale with faces, those 
receiving Synera reported less <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> from lidocaine injection than those 
receiving placebo.  Older children used the numerical Oucher <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> scale to 
report <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> intensity.  There was no difference between treatments observed in 
the older children.</span></p>

<h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h2>
<p class="First"><span>Synera is indicated for use on intact skin to provide local dermal 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> for superficial venous access and superficial dermatological 
procedures such as excision, electrodessication and shave biopsy of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4316083" conceptname="Skin lesion">skin lesions</span> 
(see CLINICAL STUDIES section).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34070-3">
<a name="section-1.5"></a><p></p>
<h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h2>
<p class="First"><span>Synera is contraindicated in patients with a known history of 
sensitivity to lidocaine, tetracaine, or local anesthetics of the amide or ester 
type.  Synera is also contraindicated in patients with para-aminobenzoic acid 
(PABA) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> and in patients with a known history of sensitivity to 
any other component of the product.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34071-1">
<a name="section-1.6"></a><p></p>
<h2>WARNINGS</h2>
<p class="First"><span>Application of Synera (lidocaine 70 mg and tetracaine 70 mg) topical 
patch for longer duration than recommended, or the simultaneous or sequential 
application of multiple Synera patches, could result in sufficient absorption of 
lidocaine and tetracaine to result in serious adverse effects (see 
Overdosage).</span></p>
<p><span>Even a </span><span class="Italics">used</span><span> Synera patch contains a large amount of 
lidocaine and tetracaine (at least 90% of the initial amount).  The potential 
exists for a child or pet to suffer serious adverse effects from chewing or 
ingesting a new or used Synera patch.  It is important for patients to store and 
dispose of Synera out of the reach of children and pets.</span></p>

<h2>PRECAUTIONS SECTION</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span>General:</span></span><span><span> Synera should be used 
with caution in patients who may be more sensitive to the systemic effects of 
lidocaine and tetracaine including the acutely ill or debilitated.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Allergic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4148381" conceptname="Anaphylactoid reaction">anaphylactoid reactions</span> associated with lidocaine, 
tetracaine, or other components of Synera can occur.  They are characterized by 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="139900" conceptname="Urticaria">urticaria</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432791" conceptname="Angioedema">angioedema</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="256717" conceptname="Bronchospasm">bronchospasm</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span>.  If an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergic reaction</span> occurs, 
it should be managed by conventional means.</span></p>
<p><span>Contact of Synera with the eyes should be avoided based on the 
findings of severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4049206" conceptname="Burning sensation in eye">eye irritation</span> with the use of similar products in animals.  
Also, the loss of protective reflexes may predispose to corneal irritation and 
potential <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4269361" conceptname="Friction burn">abrasion</span>.  If eye contact occurs, immediately wash out the eye with 
water or saline and protect the eye until sensation returns.</span></p>
<p><span>Synera is not recommended for use on mucous membranes or on areas 
with a compromised skin barrier because these uses have not been adequately 
studied.  Application to broken or inflamed skin may result in toxic blood 
concentrations of lidocaine and tetracaine from increased absorption.</span></p>
<p><span>Patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span> or pseudocholinesterase 
deficiency, because of their inability to metabolize local anesthetics normally, 
are at a greater risk of developing toxic plasma concentrations of lidocaine and 
tetracaine.</span></p>
<p><span>Lidocaine has been shown to inhibit viral and bacterial growth.  The 
effect of Synera on intradermal injections of live vaccines has not been 
determined.</span></p>
<p><span>The 
integrated heating component contains iron powder, therefore, the Synera patch 
must be removed before a patient undergoes magnetic resonance 
imaging.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span>Information for patients:</span></span><span><span>  Patients should be 
aware that topical application of local anesthetics such as Synera may lead to 
diminished or blocked sensation in the treated skin.  For this reason, patients 
should avoid inadvertent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433633" conceptname="Late effect of superficial injury">trauma</span> to the treated area.  Such <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433633" conceptname="Late effect of superficial injury">trauma</span> can result 
from scratching or rubbing before complete sensation has returned, or from 
exposure to extreme hot or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">cold</span> temperatures.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span>Drug Interactions:</span></span><span></span></p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"><span>Antiarrhythmic Drugs: 
</span></span><span></span><span><span>Synera should be used with caution in patients receiving Class I 
antiarrhythmic drugs (such as tocainide and mexiletine) since the systemic toxic 
effects are thought to be additive and potentially synergistic with lidocaine 
and tetracaine.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"><span>Local Anesthetics: </span></span></span><span>When Synera is used concomitantly with other products containing 
local anesthetic agents, the amount absorbed from all formulations should be 
considered since the systemic toxic effects are thought to be additive and 
potentially synergistic with lidocaine and tetracaine.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of 
Fertility:</span></span><span></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span><span>:  Long-term studies 
in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of 
either lidocaine or tetracaine.  </span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span>Mutagenesis</span></span><span><span>:  The mutagenic 
potential of lidocaine base and tetracaine base has been determined in the </span><span class="Italics">in vitro</span><span> Ames Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay, the </span><span class="Italics">in 
vitro</span><span> chromosome aberration assay using Chinese hamster ovary cells, and 
the </span><span class="Italics">in vivo</span><span> mouse micronucleus assay.  Lidocaine was negative in all 
three assays.  Tetracaine was negative in the </span><span class="Italics">in vitro</span><span> Ames assay 
and the </span><span class="Italics">in vivo</span><span> mouse micronucleus assay.  In the </span><span class="Italics">in 
vitro</span><span> chromosome aberration assay, tetracaine was negative in the absence 
of metabolic activation, and equivocal in the presence of metabolic 
activation.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span>Impairment of Fertility</span></span><span><span>:  Lidocaine did not 
affect fertility in female rats when given via continuous subcutaneous infusion 
via osmotic minipumps up to doses of 250 mg/kg/day (1500 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> or 
43-fold higher than the single dermal administration [SDA]).  </span><span>Although lidocaine treatment of 
male rats increased the copulatory interval and lead to a dose-related decreased 
homogenization resistant sperm head count, daily sperm production, and 
spermatogenic efficiency, the treatment did not affect overall fertility in male 
rats when given subcutaneous doses up to 60 mg/kg (360 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> or 
8-fold the SDA). </span><span>Tetracaine did not affect fertility in male or female rats when given 
subcutaneous doses up to 7.5 mg/kg (45 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> or 1-fold the SDA).  
Multiples of exposure are based on an SDA of 70 mg each of lidocaine and 
tetracaine in Synera patch for 30 minutes to a 60 kg person (43

behavior among offspring.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436077" conceptname="Developmental delay">Developmental delays</span> were observed for negative

and response to thermal and electrical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span> stimuli, and water maze 
acquisition.  The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436077" conceptname="Developmental delay">developmental delays</span> of the neonatal animals were transient 
with responses becoming comparable to untreated animals later in life.  The 
clinical relevance of the animal data is uncertain.</span></p>
<p><span>Pre- and postnatal maturational, behavioral, or reproductive 
development was not affected by maternal subcutaneous administration of 
tetracaine during gestation and lactation up to doses of 7.5 mg/kg (45 
mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> or 1-fold the SDA).</span></p>
<p><span>No adequate and well-controlled studies have been conducted in 
pregnant women.  Because animal studies are not always predictive of human 
response, Synera should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit 
justifies risk to the fetus.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span>Labor and Delivery: </span></span><span><span>Neither lidocaine nor 
tetracaine is contraindicated in labor and delivery.  In humans, the use of 
lidocaine for labor conduction <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> has not been associated with an 
increased incidence of adverse fetal effects either during delivery or during 
the neonatal period.  Tetracaine has also been used as a conduction anesthetic 
for cesarean section without apparent adverse effects on offspring.  Should 
Synera be used concomitantly with other products containing lidocaine and/or 
tetracaine, total doses contributed by all formulations must be considered. 
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span>Nursing Mothers: </span></span><span><span>Lidocaine is excreted 
into human milk and it is not known if tetracaine is excreted into human milk.  
Therefore, caution should be exercised when Synera is administered to a nursing 
mother since the milk:plasma ratio of lidocaine is 0.4 and is not determined for 
tetracaine.  In a prior report, when lidocaine was used as an epidural 
anesthetic for cesarean section in 27 women, a milk:plasma ratio of 1.07 ±0.82 
was found by using AUC values.  Following single dose administration of 20 mg of 
lidocaine for a dental procedure, the point value milk:plasma ratio was 
similarly reported as 1.1 at five to six hours after injection.  Thus, the 
estimated maximum total daily dose of lidocaine delivered to the infant via 
breast milk would be approximately 36 µg/kg.  Based on these data and the low 
concentrations of lidocaine and tetracaine found in the plasma after topical 
administration of Synera in recommended doses, the small amount of these primary 
compounds and their metabolites that would be ingested orally by a suckling 
infant is unlikely to cause adverse effects (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, 
Pharmacokinetics).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span>Pediatric Use: </span></span><span><span>The safety and 
effectiveness of Synera have been established in pediatric patients 3 years and 
older based on adequate and well-controlled studies (see CLINICAL STUDIES).   
Safety has also been demonstrated in a clinical study in which 34 infants 4 to 6 
months of age received Synera.  The recommended application time for the patch 
for pediatric patients is the same as for adults.  Simultaneous or sequential 
application of more than two Synera patches to children is not recommended as it 
has not been adequately studied.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span>Use in Geriatric Patients: </span></span><span><span>In the controlled 
clinical studies, 139 patients over 65 years of age, including 41 patients over 
75 years of age, received Synera.  VAS <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> score differences between Synera and 
placebo were considerably lower in the geriatric subjects than in the rest of 
the adult population.  No overall differences in safety were observed between 
geriatric subjects and younger subjects.  However, increased sensitivity in 
individual patients greater than 65 years of age cannot be ruled out.  After 
intravenous dosing, the elimination half-life of lidocaine is significantly 
longer in elderly patients (2.5 hours) than in younger patients (1.5 
hours).</span></span></p>

<h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h2>
<p class="First"><span>Three different formulations were studied during clinical development 
of Synera: Developmental A (n=138), Developmental B (n=30), and the Synera final 
formulation (n=1281).  The developmental patch formulations each contained the 
same amount of the active drug (70 mg each of lidocaine and tetracaine) as the 
final patch formulation, but varying amounts of excipients, principally 
polyvinyl alcohol and water.  Data obtained from studies utilizing the 
developmental patches have been included in the overall evaluation of Synera 
safety (calculation of adverse event incidence).</span></p>

<h2>OVERDOSAGE</h2>
<p class="First"><span>In adults the maximum peak plasma concentrations of lidocaine and 
tetracaine following application of two to four Synera patches for 30-60 minutes 
were less than 9 ng/mL and tetracaine levels were not detectable.  In children, 
the maximum observed peak plasma concentrations of lidocaine were 63 ng/mL and 
331 ng/mL after the application of one or two Synera patches, respectively.  
Higher maximum concentrations of lidocaine were observed for younger children 
when compared to older children.  The maximum concentration of tetracaine 
observed in children was 65 ng/mL, and most values obtained were &lt;0.9 
ng/mL.  Signs of CNS toxicity may start at plasma concentrations of lidocaine as 
low as 1000 ng/mL, and the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> generally increases with increasing 
plasma levels.  Very high levels of lidocaine can cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317109" conceptname="Respiratory arrest">respiratory arrest</span>,

with a profile of systemic CNS and cardiovascular adverse events similar to 
lidocaine, although toxicity associated with tetracaine is thought to occur at 
lower doses compared to lidocaine.  The toxicity of co-administered local 
anesthetics is thought to be at least additive.  In the absence of massive 
topical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> or oral ingestion, other etiologies for the clinical effects or 
overdosage from other sources of lidocaine, tetracaine or other local 
anesthetics should be considered.  The management of overdosage includes close 
monitoring, supportive care and symptomatic treatment.  Dialysis is of 
negligible value in the treatment of acute overdosage of lidocaine.</span></p>

<h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h2>
<p class="First"><span>Synera should only be applied to intact skin. </span></p>
<p><span>Use immediately after opening the pouch. </span></p>
<p><span> For adults and children 3 years of age and older:</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span>Venipuncture or Intravenous Cannulation: </span></span><span></span><span>Prior to venipuncture 
or intravenous cannulation, apply Synera to intact skin for 20-30 
minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span>Superficial Dermatological Procedures:  </span></span><span></span><span>For superficial 
dermatological procedures such as superficial excision or shave biopsy, apply 
Synera to intact skin for 30 minutes prior to the procedure.</span></p>
<p><span>While efficacy has not been established for children less than 3 
years of age, safe use of Synera in infants 4 to 6 months of age was documented 
in one study.</span></p>
<p><span>In general, simultaneous or sequential application of multiple Synera 
patches is not recommended.  However, application of one additional patch at a 
new location to facilitate venous access is acceptable after a failed 
attempt.</span></p>
<p><span>If irritation or a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235891" conceptname="Burning sensation">burning sensation</span> occurs during application, 
remove the patch.</span></p>
<p><span>When Synera is used concomitantly with other products containing 
local anesthetic agents, the amount absorbed from all formulations should be 
considered, as local anesthetics are thought to have at least additive 
toxicities.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="44425-7">
<a name="section-1.11"></a><p></p>
<h2>HANDLING AND DISPOSAL</h2>
<p class="First"><span>Hands should be washed after handling Synera, and eye contact with 
Synera should be avoided.  The used patch should be disposed of immediately.  
The adhesive sides of the patch should be folded together and the patch should 
then be thrown away in a location that is out of the reach of children and 
pets.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span>Do not cut the patch or otherwise remove the top cover as this could 
cause the patch to heat to temperatures that could cause thermal injury.  Do not 
cover the holes on the top side of the patch as this could cause the patch not 
to heat.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Access to Synera by children or pets should be prevented during usage 
and storage of the product.</span></p>
