<h1>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>SEROQUEL can be taken with or without food.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Dose Selection</span>— SEROQUEL should generally be administered with an initial dose of 25 mg twice daily, with increases in total daily dose of 25 mg  - 50 mg divided in two or three doses on the second and third day, as tolerated, to a total dose range of 300 mg to 400 mg daily by the fourth day.  Further dosage adjustments, if indicated, should generally occur at intervals of not less than 2 days, as steady-state for SEROQUEL would not be achieved for approximately 1-2 days in the typical patient.  When dosage adjustments are necessary, dose increments/decrements of 25 mg - 50 mg divided twice daily are recommended.  Most efficacy data with SEROQUEL were obtained using three times daily dosing regimens, but in one controlled trial 225 mg given twice per day was also effective.</p>
<p>Efficacy in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> was demonstrated in a dose range of 150 mg/day to 750 mg/day in the clinical trials supporting the effectiveness of SEROQUEL.  In a dose response study, doses above 300 mg/day were not demonstrated to be more efficacious than the 300 mg/day dose.  In other studies, however, doses in the range of 400 mg/day - 500 mg/day appeared to be needed.  The safety of doses above 800 mg/day has not been evaluated in clinical trials. </p>
<p><span class="Underline">Maintenance Treatment</span>—The effectiveness of SEROQUEL for longer than 6 weeks has not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials.  While there is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with SEROQUEL should be maintained, it is generally recommended that responding patients be continued beyond the acute response, but at the lowest dose needed to maintain remission.  Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Adolescents (13-17 years)</span></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Dose Selection</span>—SEROQUEL should be administered twice daily. However, based on response and tolerability SEROQUEL may be administered three times daily where needed.</p>
<p>The total daily dose for the initial five days of therapy is 50 mg (Day 1), 100 mg (Day 2), 200 mg (Day 3), 300 mg (Day 4) and 400 mg (Day 5).  After Day 5, the dose should be adjusted within the recommended dose range of 400 mg/day to 800 mg/day based on response and tolerability. Dosage adjustments should be in increments of no greater than 100 mg/day.  Efficacy was demonstrated with SEROQUEL at both 400 mg and 800 mg; however, no additional benefit was seen in the 800 mg group.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Maintenance Treatment</span>—The effectiveness of SEROQUEL for longer than 6 weeks has not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials.  While there is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with SEROQUEL should be maintained, it is generally recommended that responding patients be continued beyond the acute response, but at the lowest dose needed to maintain remission.

<p><span class="Underline">Dose Selection</span>—When used as monotherapy or adjunct therapy (with lithium or divalproex), SEROQUEL should be initiated in  twice daily doses totaling 100 mg/day on Day 1, increased to 400 mg/day on Day 4 in increments of up to 100 mg/day in twice daily divided doses.  Further dosage adjustments up to 800 mg/day by Day 6 should be in increments of no greater than 200 mg/day. Data indicate that the majority of patients responded between 400 mg/day to 800 mg/day.

<p>The effectiveness of SEROQUEL for longer than 3 weeks has not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials of children and adolescents.  While there is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with SEROQUEL should be maintained, it is generally recommended that responding patients be continued beyond the acute response, but at the lowest dose needed to maintain remission.  Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. </p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Consideration should be given to a slower rate of dose titration and a lower target dose in the elderly and in patients who are debilitated or who have a predisposition to hypotensive reactions [<span class="Italics">see </span><span class="Italics"><a href="#williamsonbk1173118006644">Clinical Pharmacology (12)</a></span>].  When indicated, dose escalation should be performed with caution in these patients.  </p>
<p>Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> should be started on 25 mg/day. The dose should be increased daily in increments of 25 mg/day – 50 mg/day to an effective dose, depending on the clinical response and tolerability of the patient.  </p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Although there are no data to specifically address reinitiation of treatment, it is recommended that when restarting patients who have had an interval of less than one week off SEROQUEL, titration of SEROQUEL is not required and the maintenance dose may be reinitiated.  When restarting therapy of patients who have been off SEROQUEL for more than one week, the initial titration schedule should be followed. </p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> from antipsychotics to SEROQUEL, or concerning concomitant administration with antipsychotics. While immediate discontinuation of the previous antipsychotic treatment may be acceptable for some patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span>, more gradual discontinuation may be most appropriate for others. In all cases, the period of overlapping antipsychotic administration should be minimized. When switching patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> from depot antipsychotics, if medically appropriate, initiate SEROQUEL therapy in place of the next scheduled injection. The need for continuing existing EPS medication should be re-evaluated periodically.</p>

<p>Patients with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and/or the emergence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4092095" conceptname="Planning suicide">suicidal ideation</span> and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> is a known risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18-24) with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. </p>
<p>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440374" conceptname="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">obsessive compulsive disorder</span> (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1. </p>

<p>No <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>.  </p>
<p>It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months.

Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. </p>
<p>Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder:</span> A major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive episode</span> may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder.

However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4191716" conceptname="Symptoms of depression">depressive symptoms</span> should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>, bipolar disorder, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.

Rare cases of NMS have been reported with SEROQUEL. Clinical manifestations of NMS are <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260205" conceptname="Hyperpyrexia">hyperpyrexia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4050941" conceptname="Muscle rigidity">muscle rigidity</span>, altered mental status, and evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434633" conceptname="Disorder of autonomic nervous system">autonomic instability</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4088122" conceptname="Heart irregular">irregular pulse</span> or blood pressure, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">diaphoresis</span>, and cardiac dysrhythmia).

<p>The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated.  In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255848" conceptname="Pneumonia">pneumonia</span>, systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4181404" conceptname="Heat stroke">heat stroke</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">drug fever</span> and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.</p>
<p>The management of NMS should include: 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available.  There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS.</p>
<p>If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered.  The patient should be carefully monitored since recurrences of NMS have been reported.</p>

<p>In a 24-week trial (active-controlled, 115 patients treated with SEROQUEL) designed to evaluate glycemic status with oral glucose tolerance testing of all patients, at week 24 the incidence of a treatment-emergent post-glucose challenge glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL was 1.7% and the incidence of a fasting treatment-emergent blood glucose level ≥ 126 mg/dL was 2.6%. The mean change in fasting glucose from baseline was 3.2 mg/dL and mean change in 2 hour glucose from baseline was -1.8 mg/dL for quetiapine.</p>
<p>In 2 long-term placebo-controlled randomized withdrawal clinical trials for bipolar maintenance, mean exposure of 213 days for SEROQUEL (646 patients) and 152 days for placebo (680 patients), the mean change in glucose from baseline was +5.0 mg/dL for SEROQUEL and –0.05 mg/dL for placebo. The exposure-adjusted rate of any increased blood glucose level (≥ 126 mg/dL) for patients more than 8 hours since a meal (however, some patients may not have been precluded from calorie intake from fluids during fasting period) was 18.0 per 100 patient years for SEROQUEL (10.7% of patients; n=556) and 9.5 for placebo per 100 patient years (4.6% of patients; n=581).</p>

<p>In an open-label study that enrolled patients from the above two pediatric trials, 63% of patients (241/380) completed 26 weeks of therapy with SEROQUEL. After 26 weeks of treatment, the mean increase in body weight was 4.4 kg. Forty-five percent of the patients gained  ≥ 7% of their body weight, not adjusted for normal growth. In order to adjust for normal growth over 26 weeks an increase of at least 0.5 standard deviation from baseline in BMI was used as a measure of a clinically significant change; 18.3% of patients on SEROQUEL met this criterion after 26 weeks of treatment.</p>
<p>When treating pediatric patients with SEROQUEL for any indication, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span> should be assessed against that expected for normal growth.</p>

Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome.  Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> is unknown.  </p>
<p>The risk of developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase.  However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses or may even arise after discontinuation of treatment. </p>
<p>There is no known treatment for established cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn.  Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process.  The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.  </p>
<p>Given these considerations, SEROQUEL should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>.  Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who appear to suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate.  In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought.  The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.  </p>
<p>If signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> appear in a patient on SEROQUEL, drug discontinuation should be considered.  However, some patients may require treatment with SEROQUEL despite the presence of the syndrome.</p>

<p>The development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">cataracts</span> was observed in association with quetiapine treatment in chronic dog studies  [<span class="Italics">see </span><span class="Italics"><a href="#williamsonbk1173118579590">Nonclinical Toxicology, Animal Toxicology  (13.2)</a></span>].  Lens changes have also been observed in adults, children and adolescents during long-term SEROQUEL treatment, but a causal relationship to SEROQUEL use has not been established.

<p><span>In clinical trials quetiapine was not associated with a persistent increase in QT intervals. However, the QT effect was not systematically evaluated in a thorough QT study. In post marketing experience, there were cases reported of QT prolongation in patients who overdosed on quetiapine [<span class="Italics">see </span></span><span class="Italics"><a href="#williamsonbk1263236951731">Overdosage (10.1)</a></span><span>], in patients with concomitant illness, and in patients taking medicines known to cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022093" conceptname="Electrolyte imbalance">electrolyte imbalance</span> or increase QT interval [<span class="Italics">see </span></span><span class="Italics"><a href="#williamsonbk1173119930916">Drug Interactions (7)</a></span><span>].</span></p>
<p><span>The use of quetiapine should be avoided in combination with other drugs that are known to prolong QTc including Class 1A antiarrythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), antipsychotic medications (e.g., ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine), antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin), or any other class of medications known to prolong the QTc interval (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone).</span></p>

<p><span><span class="Italics">Adults:</span> Clinical trials with quetiapine demonstrated dose-related decreases in thyroid hormone levels. The reduction in total and free thyroxine (T4) of approximately 20% at the higher end of the therapeutic dose range was maximal in the first six weeks of treatment and maintained without adaptation or progression during more chronic therapy.   In nearly all cases, cessation of quetiapine treatment was associated with a reversal of the effects on total and free T4, irrespective of the duration of treatment. About 0.7% (26/3489) of SEROQUEL patients did experience TSH increases in monotherapy studies.  Some patients with TSH increases needed replacement thyroid treatment.  In the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">mania</span> adjunct studies, where SEROQUEL was added to lithium or divalproex, 12% (24/196) of SEROQUEL treated patients compared to 7% (15/203) of placebo-treated patients had elevated TSH levels.  Of the SEROQUEL treated patients with elevated TSH levels, 3 had simultaneous low free T4 levels.</span></p>
<p><span>In all quetiapine trials, the incidence of potentially clinically significant shifts in thyroid hormones and TSH were*: decrease in free T4, 2.0% (357/17513); decrease in total T4, 4.0% (75/1861); decrease in free T3, 0.4% (53/13766); decrease in total T3, 2.0% (26/1312), and increase in TSH, 4.9% (956/19412).

<p>Although not reported with SEROQUEL, disruption of the body's ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents.  Appropriate care is advised when prescribing SEROQUEL for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435796" conceptname="Dehydration">dehydration</span>.</p>

<p>Adults</p>
<p>Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p>
<p>The information below is derived from a clinical trial database for SEROQUEL consisting of over 4300 patients.  This database includes 698 patients exposed to SEROQUEL for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436665" conceptname="Bipolar disorder">bipolar depression</span>, 405 patients exposed to SEROQUEL for the treatment of acute bipolar <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">mania</span> (monotherapy and adjunct therapy), 646 patients exposed to SEROQUEL for the maintenance treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432876" conceptname="Bipolar I disorder">bipolar I disorder</span> as adjunct therapy, and approximately 2600 patients and/or normal subjects exposed to 1 or more doses of SEROQUEL for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span>. </p>
<p>Of these approximately 4300 subjects, approximately 4000 (2300 in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span>, 405 in acute bipolar <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">mania</span>, 698 in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436665" conceptname="Bipolar disorder">bipolar depression</span>, and 646 for the maintenance treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432876" conceptname="Bipolar I disorder">bipolar I disorder</span>) were patients who participated in multiple dose effectiveness trials, and their experience corresponded to approximately 2400 patient-years. The conditions and duration of treatment with SEROQUEL varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) open-label and double-blind phases of studies, inpatients and outpatients, fixed-dose and dose-titration studies, and short-term or longer-term exposure.  Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse events, results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analyses, ECGs, and results of ophthalmologic examinations. </p>
<p>Adverse reactions during exposure were obtained by general inquiry and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing.  Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse reactions without first grouping similar types of reactions into a smaller number of standardized reaction categories.    </p>
<p>In the tables and tabulations that follow, standard COSTART terminology has been used to classify reported adverse reactions for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> and bipolar <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">mania</span>. MedDRA terminology has been used to classify reported adverse reactions for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436665" conceptname="Bipolar disorder">bipolar depression</span>.  </p>
<p>The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse reaction of the type listed.  A reaction was considered treatment emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation.</p>

<p>Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 1% or More Among SEROQUEL Treated Patients in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials: </p>
<p>The prescriber should be aware that the figures in the tables and tabulations cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials.  Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators.  The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side effect incidence in the population studied.</p>

<p>Adverse Reactions in Long-Term Open-Label Trial</p>
<p>The adverse reactions reported in a 26-week, open-label trial with SEROQUEL in 5% or greater of the children and adolescent  patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> or bipolar <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">mania</span> were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> (30%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span> (19%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> (11%), increased weight (13%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span> (8%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> (10%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span> (8%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span> (9%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4217027" conceptname="Increased appetite">increased appetite</span> (7%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4181583" conceptname="Upper respiratory infection">upper respiratory tract infection</span> (7%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span> (5%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span> (5%), and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span> (5%).  </p>
<p>Other Adverse Reactions Observed During the Pre-Marketing Evaluation of SEROQUEL</p>
<p> Following is a list of COSTART terms that reflect treatment-emergent adverse reactions as defined in the introduction to the ADVERSE REACTIONS section reported by patients treated with SEROQUEL at multiple doses <span class="Underline">&gt;</span> 75 mg/day during any phase of a trial within the premarketing database of approximately 2200 patients treated for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span>.  All reported reactions are included except those already listed in the tables or elsewhere in labeling, those reactions for which a drug cause was remote, and those reaction terms which were so general as to be uninformative.  It is important to emphasize that, although the reactions reported occurred during treatment with SEROQUEL, they were not necessarily caused by it.  </p>
<p>Reactions are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse reactions are those occurring in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled trials appear in this listing); infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare reactions are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.  </p>

<p><span class="Italics">ECG Changes</span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Adults:</span> Between-group comparisons for pooled placebo-controlled trials revealed no statistically significant SEROQUEL/placebo differences in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially important changes in ECG parameters, including QT, QTc, and PR intervals.  However, the proportions of patients meeting the criteria for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span> were compared in four 3- to 6-week placebo-controlled clinical trials for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> revealing a 1% (4/399) incidence for SEROQUEL compared to 0.6% (1/156) incidence for placebo.

This slight tendency to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span> in adults may be related to SEROQUEL's potential for inducing orthostatic changes [see <span class="Italics"><a href="#williamsonbk1173119764403">Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</a></span>]. </p>

<h1>DRUG INTERACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>The risks of using SEROQUEL in combination with other drugs have not been extensively evaluated in systematic studies.  Given the primary CNS effects of SEROQUEL, caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs.  SEROQUEL potentiated the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial in subjects with selected <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychotic disorders</span>, and alcoholic beverages should be avoided while taking SEROQUEL.  </p>
<p>Because of its potential for inducing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, SEROQUEL may enhance the effects of certain antihypertensive agents.  </p>
<p>SEROQUEL may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists.</p>
<p>The use of quetiapine should be avoided in combination with drugs known to increase QT interval, and caution should be exercised when quetiapine is used in combination with drugs known to cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022093" conceptname="Electrolyte imbalance">electrolyte imbalance</span> [<span class="Italics">see </span><span class="Italics"><a href="#williamsonbk1310564988191">Warnings and Precautions (5.12)</a></span>].</p>
<p>There have been literature reports suggesting false positive results in urine enzyme immunoassays for methadone and tricyclic antidepressants in patients who have taken quetiapine. Caution should be exercised in the interpretation of positive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4215138" conceptname="Drug screening test">urine drug screen</span> results for these drugs, and confirmation by alternative analytical technique (e.g. chromatographic methods) should be considered.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Phenytoin:</span> Coadministration of quetiapine (250 mg three times daily) and phenytoin (100 mg three times daily) increased the mean oral clearance of quetiapine by 5-fold.  Increased doses of SEROQUEL may be required to maintain control of symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> in patients receiving quetiapine and phenytoin, or other hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, barbiturates, rifampin, glucocorticoids).  Caution should be taken if phenytoin is withdrawn and replaced with a non-inducer (e.g., valproate) [see <span class="Italics"><a href="#williamsonbk1173117962535">Dosage and Administration (2)</a></span>].</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Divalproex:</span> Coadministration of quetiapine (150 mg twice daily) and divalproex (500 mg twice daily) increased the mean maximum plasma concentration of quetiapine at steady state by 17% without affecting the extent of absorption or mean oral clearance.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Thioridazine: </span> Thioridazine (200 mg twice daily) increased the oral clearance of quetiapine (300 mg twice daily) by 65%.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Cimetidine:</span> Administration of multiple daily doses of cimetidine (400 mg three times daily for 4 days) resulted in a 20% decrease in the mean oral clearance of quetiapine (150 mg three times daily).  Dosage adjustment for quetiapine is not required when it is given with cimetidine.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">P450 3A Inhibitors:</span> Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg once daily for 4 days), a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A, reduced oral clearance of quetiapine by 84%, resulting in a 335% increase in maximum plasma concentration of quetiapine. Caution (reduced dosage) is indicated when SEROQUEL is administered with ketoconazole and other inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A (e.g., itraconazole, fluconazole, erythromycin, and protease inhibitors). </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Fluoxetine, Imipramine, Haloperidol, and Risperidone:</span> Coadministration of fluoxetine (60 mg once daily), imipramine (75 mg twice daily), haloperidol (7.5 mg twice daily), or risperidone (3 mg twice daily) with quetiapine (300 mg twice daily) did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of quetiapine.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Lorazepam:</span>  The mean oral clearance of lorazepam (2 mg, single dose) was reduced by 20% in the presence of quetiapine administered as 250 mg three times daily dosing.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Divalproex: </span> The mean maximum concentration and extent of absorption of total and free valproic acid at steady state were decreased by 10 to 12% when divalproex (500 mg twice daily) was administered with quetiapine (150 mg twice daily).  The mean oral clearance of total valproic acid (administered as divalproex 500 mg twice daily) was increased by 11% in the presence of quetiapine (150 mg twice daily).  The changes were not significant.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Lithium:</span>  Concomitant administration of quetiapine (250 mg three times daily) with lithium had no effect on any of the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of lithium.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Antipyrine: </span> Administration of multiple daily doses up to 750 mg/day (on a three times daily schedule) of quetiapine to subjects with selected <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychotic disorders</span> had no clinically relevant effect on the clearance of antipyrine or urinary recovery of antipyrine metabolites.   These results indicate that quetiapine does not significantly induce hepatic enzymes responsible for cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism of antipyrine.</p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category C:</span></p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of SEROQUEL use in pregnant women. In limited published literature, there were no major malformations associated with quetiapine exposure during pregnancy. In animal studies, embryo-fetal toxicity occurred. Quetiapine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. </p>
<p>There are limited published data on the use of quetiapine for treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> and other psychiatric disorders during pregnancy. In a prospective observational study, 21 women exposed to quetiapine and other psychoactive medications during pregnancy delivered infants with no major malformations. Among 42 other infants born to pregnant women who used quetiapine during pregnancy, there were no major malformations reported (one study of 36 women, 6 case reports). Due to the limited number of exposed pregnancies, these postmarketing data do not reliably estimate the frequency or absence of adverse outcomes. </p>
<p>When pregnant rats and rabbits were exposed to quetiapine during organogenesis, there was no increase in the incidence of major malformations in fetuses at doses up to 2.4 times the maximum recommended human dose for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> (MRHD, 800 mg/day on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis); however, there was evidence of embryo-fetal toxicity. In rats, delays in skeletal ossification occurred at 0.6 and 2.4 times the MRHD and in rabbits at 1.2 and 2.4 times the MRHD. At 2.4 times the MRHD, there was an increased incidence of carpal/tarsal flexure (minor soft tissue anomaly) in rabbit fetuses and decreased fetal weights in both species. Maternal toxicity (decreased body weights and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>) occurred at 2.4 times the MRHD in rats and at 0.6-2.4 times the MRHD (all doses) in rabbits. </p>
<p>In a peri/postnatal reproductive study in rats, no drug-related effects were observed when pregnant dams were treated with quetiapine at doses 0.01, 0.12, and 0.24 times the MRHD. However, in a preliminary peri/postnatal study, there were increases in fetal and pup <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>, and decreases in mean litter weight at 3.0 times the MRHD.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Non-Teratogenic Effects</span></p>
<p>Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs (including SEROQUEL), during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208994" conceptname="Increased muscle tone">hypertonia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">hypotonia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4158346" conceptname="Respiratory distress">respiratory distress</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434750" conceptname="Feeding difficulties and mismanagement">feeding disorder</span> in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity; while in some cases symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. </p>
<p>SEROQUEL should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The effect of SEROQUEL on labor and delivery in humans is unknown.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>SEROQUEL was excreted into human milk. It is recommended that women receiving SEROQUEL should not breast feed. </p>
<p>In published case reports, the level of quetiapine in breast milk ranged from undetectable to 170 μg/L. The estimated infant dose ranged from 0.09% to 0.43% of the weight-adjusted maternal dose. Based on a limited number (N=8) of mother/infant pairs, calculated infant daily doses range from less than 0.01 mg/kg (at a maternal daily dose up to 100 mg quetiapine) to 0.1 mg/kg (at a maternal daily dose of 400 mg).</p>

<p>In general, the adverse reactions observed in children and adolescents during the clinical trials were similar to those in the adult population with few exceptions.

<p>Some differences in the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine were noted between children/adolescents (10 to 17 years of age) and adults.  When adjusted for weight, the AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of quetiapine were 41% and 39% lower, respectively, in children and adolescents compared to adults.

<p>Of the approximately 3700 patients in clinical studies with SEROQUEL, 7% (232) were 65 years of age or over.  In general, there was no indication of any different tolerability of SEROQUEL in the elderly compared to younger adults.  Nevertheless, the presence of factors that might decrease pharmacokinetic clearance, increase the pharmacodynamic response to SEROQUEL, or cause poorer tolerance or orthostasis, should lead to consideration of a lower starting dose, slower titration, and careful monitoring during the initial dosing period in the elderly.  The mean plasma clearance of SEROQUEL was reduced by 30% to 50% in elderly patients when compared to younger patients [<span class="Italics">see </span><span class="Italics"><a href="#williamsonbk1173118006644">Clinical Pharmacology (12)</a></span> and<span class="Italics"><a href="#williamsonbk1173117962535">Dosage and Administration (2)</a></span>].</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>The mechanism of action of SEROQUEL, as with other drugs having efficacy in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> and bipolar disorder, is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the efficacy of SEROQUEL in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> and its mood stabilizing properties in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436665" conceptname="Bipolar disorder">bipolar depression</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">mania</span> are mediated through a combination of dopamine type 2 (D<span class="Sub">2</span>) and serotonin type 2 (5HT<span class="Sub">2</span>) antagonism.  Antagonism at receptors other than dopamine and 5HT<span class="Sub">2</span> with similar receptor affinities may explain some of the other effects of SEROQUEL.   </p>
<p>SEROQUEL’s antagonism of histamine H<span class="Sub">1</span> receptors may explain the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> observed with this drug.  </p>
<p>SEROQUEL’s antagonism of adrenergic α<span class="Sub">1</span> receptors may explain the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span> observed with this drug.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>SEROQUEL is an antagonist at multiple neurotransmitter receptors in the brain: serotonin 5HT<span class="Sub">1A</span> and 5HT<span class="Sub">2</span> (IC<span class="Sub">50s</span>=717 &amp; 148nM, respectively), dopamine D<span class="Sub">1</span> and D<span class="Sub">2</span> (IC<span class="Sub">50s</span>=1268 &amp; 329nM, respectively), histamine H<span class="Sub">1</span> (IC<span class="Sub">50</span>=30nM), and adrenergic α<span class="Sub">1</span> and α<span class="Sub">2</span> receptors (IC<span class="Sub">50s</span>=94 &amp; 271nM, respectively).  SEROQUEL has no appreciable affinity at cholinergic muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors (IC<span class="Sub">50s</span>&gt;5000 nM).</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p>
<p>Quetiapine fumarate activity is primarily due to the parent drug. The multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of quetiapine are dose-proportional within the proposed clinical dose range, and quetiapine accumulation is predictable upon multiple dosing.  Elimination of quetiapine is mainly via hepatic metabolism with a mean terminal half-life of about 6 hours within the proposed clinical dose range.  Steady-state concentrations are expected to be achieved within two days of dosing.  Quetiapine is unlikely to interfere with the metabolism of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Children and Adolescents</span></p>
<p>At steady-state the pharmacokinetics of the parent compound, in children and adolescents (10-17 years of age), were similar to adults.  However, when adjusted for dose and weight, AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of the parent compound were 41% and 39% lower, respectively, in children and adolescents than in adults.  For the active metabolite, norquetiapine, AUC and C<span class="Sub">max </span>were 45% and 31% higher, respectively,  in children and adolescents than in adults.  When adjusted for dose and weight, the pharmacokinetics of the metabolite, norquetiapine, was similar between children and adolescents and adults [see<span class="Italics"><a href="#ID_f78e662d-35a4-476c-8a8c-0b427d8df50f">Use in Specific Populations (8.4)</a></span>].</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></p>
<p>Quetiapine fumarate is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 1.5 hours.  The tablet formulation is 100% bioavailable relative to solution.  The bioavailability of quetiapine is marginally affected by administration with food, with C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values increased by 25% and 15%, respectively.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></p>
<p>Quetiapine is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 10±4 L/kg.  It is 83% bound to plasma proteins at therapeutic concentrations.  <span class="Italics">In vitro</span>, quetiapine did not affect the binding of warfarin or diazepam to human serum albumin.  In turn, neither warfarin nor diazepam altered the binding of quetiapine.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Metabolism and Elimination</span></p>
<p>Following a single oral dose of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-quetiapine, less than 1% of the administered dose was excreted as unchanged drug, indicating that quetiapine is highly metabolized.  Approximately 73% and 20% of the dose was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively.</p>
<p>Quetiapine is extensively metabolized by the liver.  The major metabolic pathways are sulfoxidation to the sulfoxide metabolite and oxidation to the parent acid metabolite; both metabolites are pharmacologically inactive.  <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies using human liver microsomes revealed that the cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme is involved in the metabolism of quetiapine to its major, but inactive, sulfoxide metabolite and in the metabolism of its active metabolite N-desalkyl quetiapine.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Age</span></p>
<p>Oral clearance of quetiapine was reduced by 40% in elderly patients (≥ 65 years, n=9) compared to young patients (n=12), and dosing adjustment may be necessary [see <span class="Italics"><a href="#williamsonbk1173117962535">Dosage and Administration (2)</a></span>].</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Gender</span></p>
<p>There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Race</span></p>
<p>There is no race effect on the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Smoking</span></p>
<p>Smoking has no effect on the oral clearance of quetiapine.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span></span></p>
<p>Patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (Clcr=10-30 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>, n=8) had a 25% lower mean oral clearance than normal subjects (Clcr &gt; 80 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>, n=8), but plasma quetiapine concentrations in the subjects with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> were within the range of concentrations seen in normal subjects receiving the same dose.  Dosage adjustment is therefore not needed in these patients. </p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">Hepatic Insufficiency</span></span></p>
<p>Hepatically impaired patients (n=8) had a 30% lower mean oral clearance of quetiapine than normal subjects.  In two of the 8 hepatically impaired patients, AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> were 3 times higher than those observed typically in healthy subjects.  Since quetiapine is extensively metabolized by the liver, higher plasma levels are expected in the hepatically impaired population, and dosage adjustment may be needed [see <span class="Italics"><a href="#williamsonbk1173117962535">Dosage and Administration (2)</a></span>]. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Drug-Drug Interactions</span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> enzyme inhibition data suggest that quetiapine and 9 of its metabolites would have little inhibitory effect on <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> metabolism mediated by cytochromes P450 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4. </p>
<p>Quetiapine oral clearance is increased by the prototype cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer, phenytoin, and decreased by the prototype cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole. Dose adjustment of quetiapine will be necessary if it is coadministered with phenytoin or ketoconazole [<span class="Italics">see Drug </span><span class="Italics"><a href="#williamsonbk1173118423951">Interactions (7.1)</a></span>].   </p>
<p>Quetiapine oral clearance is not inhibited by the non-specific enzyme inhibitor, cimetidine.  </p>
<p>Quetiapine at doses of 750 mg/day did not affect the single dose pharmacokinetics of antipyrine, lithium or lorazepam [<span class="Italics">see </span><span class="Italics"><a href="#williamsonbk1173119958791">Drug Interactions (7.2)</a></span>].</p>

<h1>NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Carcinogenesis</span></p>
<p>Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in C57BL mice and Wistar rats.  Quetiapine was administered in the diet to mice at doses of 20, 75, 250, and 750 mg/kg and to rats by gavage at doses of 25, 75, and 250 mg/kg for two years.  These doses are equivalent to 0.1, 0.5, 1.5, and 4.5 times the maximum human dose (800 mg/day) on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis (mice) or 0.3, 0.9, and 3.0 times the maximum human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis (rats).   There were statistically significant increases in thyroid gland follicular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> in male mice at doses of 250 and 750 mg/kg or 1.5 and 4.5 times the maximum human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis and in male rats at a dose of 250 mg/kg or 3.0 times the maximum human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.  Mammary gland adenocarcinomas were statistically significantly increased in female rats at all doses tested (25, 75, and 250 mg/kg or 0.3, 0.9, and 3.0 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).  </p>
<p>Thyroid follicular cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> may have resulted from chronic stimulation of the thyroid gland by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) resulting from enhanced metabolism and clearance of thyroxine by rodent liver.  Changes in TSH, thyroxine, and thyroxine clearance consistent with this mechanism were observed in subchronic toxicity studies in rat and mouse and in a 1-year toxicity study in rat; however, the results of these studies were not definitive.  The relevance of the increases in thyroid follicular cell <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> to human risk, through whatever mechanism, is unknown.   </p>
<p>Antipsychotic drugs have been shown to chronically elevate prolactin levels in rodents.  Serum measurements in a 1-year toxicity study showed that quetiapine increased median serum prolactin levels a maximum of 32- and 13-fold in male and female rats, respectively.  Increases in mammary neoplasms have been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and are considered to be prolactin-mediated.  The relevance of this increased incidence of prolactin-mediated mammary gland tumors in rats to human risk is unknown [see <span class="Italics"><a href="#ID_3ad9d554-6edc-4ec3-9a73-fcef25488b4e">Warnings and Precautions (5.15)</a></span>].</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Mutagenesis</span></p>
<p>The mutagenic potential of quetiapine was tested in six <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> bacterial gene mutation assays and in an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> mammalian gene mutation assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells.  However, sufficiently high concentrations of quetiapine may not have been used for all tester <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span>.

<p>Quetiapine decreased mating and fertility in male Sprague-Dawley rats at oral doses of 50 and 150 mg/kg or 0.6 and 1.8 times the maximum human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.  Drug-related effects included increases in interval to mate and in the number of matings required for successful impregnation.  These effects continued to be observed at 150 mg/kg even after a two-week period without treatment.  The no-effect dose for impaired mating and fertility in male rats was 25 mg/kg, or 0.3 times the maximum human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.  Quetiapine adversely affected mating and fertility in female Sprague-Dawley rats at an oral dose of 50 mg/kg, or 0.6 times the maximum human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.  Drug-related effects included decreases in matings and in matings resulting in pregnancy, and an increase in the interval to mate.  An increase in irregular estrus cycles was observed at doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg, or 0.1 and 0.6 times the maximum human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.  The no-effect dose in female rats was 1 mg/kg, or 0.01 times the maximum human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p>

<p>Quetiapine caused a dose-related increase in pigment deposition in thyroid gland in rat toxicity studies which were 4 weeks in duration or longer and in a mouse 2–year carcinogenicity study.  Doses were 10-250 mg/kg in rats, 75-750 mg/kg in mice; these doses are 0.1-3.0, and 0.1-4.5 times the maximum recommended human dose (on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis), respectively.  Pigment deposition was shown to be irreversible in rats.  The identity of the pigment could not be determined, but was found to be co-localized with quetiapine in thyroid gland follicular epithelial cells.  The functional effects and the relevance of this finding to human risk are unknown.</p>
<p>In dogs receiving quetiapine for 6 or 12 months, but not for 1 month, focal triangular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">cataracts</span> occurred at the junction of posterior sutures in the outer cortex of the lens at a dose of 100 mg/kg, or 4 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.  This finding may be due to inhibition of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> biosynthesis by quetiapine.  Quetiapine caused a dose-related reduction in plasma <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> levels in repeat-dose dog and monkey studies; however, there was no correlation between plasma <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> and the presence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">cataracts</span> in individual dogs.  The appearance of delta–8–cholestanol in plasma is consistent with inhibition of a late stage in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> biosynthesis in these species.  There also was a 25% reduction in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> content of the outer cortex of the lens observed in a special study in quetiapine treated female dogs.

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p>
<p>The efficacy of SEROQUEL in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> was established in 3 short-term (6-week) controlled trials of inpatients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> who met DSM III-R criteria for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span>.  Although a single fixed dose haloperidol arm was included as a comparative treatment in one of the three trials, this single haloperidol dose group was inadequate to provide a reliable and valid comparison of SEROQUEL and haloperidol.</p>
<p>Several instruments were used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms in these studies, among them the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), a multi-item inventory of general psychopathology traditionally used to evaluate the effects of drug treatment in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span>.  The BPRS <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychosis</span> cluster (conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, suspiciousness, and unusual thought content) is considered a particularly useful subset for assessing actively <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychotic</span> schizophrenic patients.  A second traditional assessment, the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), reflects the impression of a skilled observer, fully familiar with the manifestations of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span>, about the overall clinical state of the patient.  </p>
<p>The results of the trials follow:</p>
<p>1.In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial (n=361) involving 5 fixed doses of SEROQUEL (75 mg/day, 150 mg/day, 300 mg/day, 600 mg/day and 750 mg/day given in divided doses three times per day), the 4 highest doses of SEROQUEL were generally superior to placebo on the BPRS total score, the BPRS <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychosis</span> cluster and the CGI severity score, with the maximal effect seen at 300 mg/day, and the effects of doses of 150 mg/day to 750 mg/day were generally indistinguishable.2.In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial (n=286) involving titration of SEROQUEL in high (up to 750 mg/day given in divided doses three times per day) and low (up to 250 mg/day given in divided doses three times per day) doses, only the high dose SEROQUEL group (mean dose, 500 mg/day) was superior to placebo on the BPRS total score, the BPRS <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychosis</span> cluster, and the CGI severity score.3.In a 6-week dose and dose regimen comparison trial (n=618) involving two fixed doses of SEROQUEL (450 mg/day given in divided doses both twice daily and three times daily and 50 mg/day given in divided doses twice daily), only the 450 mg/day (225 mg given twice daily) dose group was superior to the 50 mg/day (25 mg given twice daily) SEROQUEL dose group on the BPRS total score, the BPRS <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychosis</span> cluster, and the CGI severity score.</p>
<p>Examination of population subsets (race, gender, and age) did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of race or gender, with an apparently greater effect in patients under the age of 40 years compared to those older than 40.  The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Adolescents (ages 13-17)</span></p>
<p>The efficacy of SEROQUEL in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> in adolescents (13–17 years of age) was demonstrated in a 6–week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients who met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435783" conceptname="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> were randomized into one of three treatment groups: SEROQUEL 400 mg/day (n = 73), SEROQUEL 800 mg/day (n = 74), or placebo (n = 75). Study medication was initiated at 50 mg/day and on day 2 increased to 100 mg/per day (divided and given two or three times per day). Subsequently, the dose was titrated to the target dose of 400 mg/day or 800 mg/day using increments of 100 mg/day, divided and given two or three times daily. The primary efficacy variable was the mean change from baseline in total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). </p>
<p> SEROQUEL at 400 mg/day and 800 mg/day was superior to placebo in the reduction of PANSS total score.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p>
<p>The efficacy of SEROQUEL in the acute treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic episodes</span> was established in 3 placebo-controlled trials in patients who met DSM-IV criteria for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432876" conceptname="Bipolar I disorder">bipolar I disorder</span> with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic episodes</span>.  These trials included patients with or without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychotic</span> features and excluded patients with rapid cycling and mixed episodes. Of these trials, 2 were monotherapy (12 weeks) and 1 was adjunct therapy (3 weeks) to either lithium or divalproex. Key outcomes in these trials were change from baseline in the Young <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">Mania</span> Rating Scale (YMRS) score at 3 and 12 weeks for monotherapy and at 3 weeks for adjunct therapy. Adjunct therapy is defined as the simultaneous initiation or subsequent administration of SEROQUEL with lithium or divalproex.   </p>
<p>The primary rating instrument used for assessing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span> symptoms in these trials was YMRS, an 11-item clinician-rated scale traditionally used to assess the degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span> symptomatology (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, disruptive/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021344" conceptname="Abusive behavior">aggressive behavior</span>, sleep, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4304866" conceptname="Elevated mood">elevated mood</span>, speech, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">increased activity</span>, sexual interest, language/thought disorder, thought content, appearance, and insight) in a range from 0 (no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span> features) to 60 (maximum score). </p>
<p>The results of the trials follow: </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Monotherapy</span></p>
<p>The efficacy of SEROQUEL in the acute treatment of bipolar <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">mania</span> was established in 2 placebo-controlled trials. In two 12-week trials (n=300, n=299) comparing SEROQUEL to placebo, SEROQUEL was superior to placebo in the reduction of the YMRS total score at weeks 3 and 12. The majority of patients in these trials taking SEROQUEL were dosed in a range between 400 mg/day and 800 mg per day.   </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Adjunct Therapy</span></p>
<p>In this 3-week placebo-controlled trial, 170 patients with bipolar <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">mania</span> (YMRS <span class="Underline">&gt;</span> 20) were randomized to receive SEROQUEL or placebo as adjunct treatment to lithium or divalproex. Patients may or may not have received an adequate treatment course of lithium or divalproex prior to randomization. SEROQUEL was superior to placebo when added to lithium or divalproex alone in the reduction of YMRS total score.  </p>
<p>The majority of patients in this trial taking SEROQUEL were dosed in a range between 400 mg/day and 800 mg per day. In a similarly designed trial (n=200), SEROQUEL was associated with an improvement in YMRS scores but did not demonstrate superiority to placebo, possibly due to a higher placebo effect.  </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Children and Adolescents (ages 10-17)</span></p>
<p>The efficacy of SEROQUEL in the acute treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic episodes</span> associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432876" conceptname="Bipolar I disorder">bipolar I disorder</span> in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age) was demonstrated in a 3-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. Patients who met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic episode</span> were randomized into one of three treatment groups: SEROQUEL 400 mg/day (n = 95), SEROQUEL 600 mg/day (n = 98), or placebo (n = 91). Study medication was initiated at 50 mg/day and on day 2 increased to 100 mg/day (divided doses given two or three times daily). Subsequently, the dose was titrated to a target dose of 400 mg/day or 600 mg/day using increments of 100 mg/day, given in divided doses two or three times daily. The primary efficacy variable was the mean change from baseline in total YMRS score.  </p>
<p>SEROQUEL 400 mg/day and 600 mg/day were superior to placebo in the reduction of YMRS total score. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depressive Episodes</span></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p>
<p>The efficacy of SEROQUEL for the acute treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive episodes</span> associated with bipolar disorder was established in 2 identically designed 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies  (N=1045).   These studies included patients with either bipolar I or II disorder and those with or without a rapid cycling course. Patients randomized to SEROQUEL were administered fixed doses of either 300 mg or 600 mg once daily.    </p>
<p>The primary rating instrument used to assess <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4191716" conceptname="Symptoms of depression">depressive symptoms</span> in these studies was the Montgomery-Asberg <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> Rating Scale (MADRS), a 10–item clinician-rated scale with scores ranging from 0 to 60.  The primary endpoint in both studies was the change from baseline in MADRS score at week 8.  In both studies, SEROQUEL was superior to placebo in reduction of MADRS score. Improvement in symptoms, as measured by change in MADRS score relative to placebo, was seen in both studies at Day 8 (week 1) and onwards. In these studies, no additional benefit was seen with the 600 mg dose. For the 300 mg dose group, statistically significant improvements over placebo were seen in overall quality of life and satisfaction related to various areas of functioning, as measured using the Q-LES-Q(SF).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Maintenance Treatment as an Adjunct to Lithium or Divalproex</span></p>
<p>The efficacy of SEROQUEL in the maintenance treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432876" conceptname="Bipolar I disorder">bipolar I disorder</span> was established in 2 placebo-controlled trials in patients (n=1326) who met DSM-IV criteria for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432876" conceptname="Bipolar I disorder">bipolar I disorder</span>. The trials included patients whose most recent episode was <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span>, depressed, or mixed, with or without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychotic</span> features.   In the open-label phase, patients were required to be stable on SEROQUEL plus lithium or divalproex for at least 12 weeks in order to be randomized. On average, patients were stabilized for 15 weeks. In the randomization phase, patients continued treatment with lithium or divalproex and were randomized to receive either SEROQUEL (administered twice daily totaling 400 mg/day to 800 mg/day) or placebo. Approximately 50% of the patients had discontinued from the SEROQUEL group by day 280 and 50% of the placebo group had discontinued by day 117 of double-blind treatment. The primary endpoint in these studies was time to recurrence of a mood event (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span>, mixed or depressed episode). A mood event was defined as medication initiation or hospitalization for a mood episode; YMRS score ≥ 20 or MADRS score ≥ 20 at 2 consecutive assessments; or study discontinuation due to a mood event.</p>
<p>In both studies, SEROQUEL was superior to placebo in increasing the time to recurrence of any mood event. The treatment effect was present for increasing time to recurrence of both <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic</span> and depressed episodes. The effect of SEROQUEL was independent of any specific subgroup (assigned mood stabilizer, sex, age, race, most recent bipolar episode, or rapid cycling course). </p>
