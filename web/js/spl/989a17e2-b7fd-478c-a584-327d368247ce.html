<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Morphine is a pure opioid agonist whose principal therapeutic action is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>.  Other members of the class known as opioid agonists include substances such as oxycodone, hydromorphone, fentanyl, codeine, and hydrocodone.  Pharmacological effects of opioid agonists include anxiolysis, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142453" conceptname="Feeling high">euphoria</span>, feelings of relaxation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">constipation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435279" conceptname="Tonic pupillary reaction">miosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4009383" conceptname="Cough suppression">cough suppression</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>.  Like all pure opioid agonist analgesics, with increasing doses there is increasing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, unlike with mixed agonist/antagonists or non-opioid analgesics, where there is a limit to the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span> with increasing doses.  With pure opioid agonist analgesics, there is no defined maximum dose; the ceiling to analgesic effectiveness is imposed only by side effects, the more serious which may include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">

<h2>Central Nervous System</h2>
<p class="First">The principal actions of therapeutic value of morphine are <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> and sedation (i.e., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> and anxiolysis).</p>
<p>The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown.  However, specific CNS opiate receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are likely to play a role in the expression of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effects</span>.</p>
<p>Morphine produces <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> by direct action on brainstem respiratory centers.  The mechanism of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brainstem respiratory centers to increases in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135927" conceptname="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4200706" conceptname="Tension">tension</span>, and to electrical stimulation.</p>
<p>Morphine depresses the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> reflex by direct effect on the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> center in the medulla.  Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>.  Morphine causes <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435279" conceptname="Tonic pupillary reaction">miosis</span>, even in total darkness.  Pinpoint pupils are a sign of narcotic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings).

<h2>Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle</h2>
<p class="First">Morphine causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and in the duodenum.  Digestion of food is delayed in the small intestine and propulsive contractions are decreased.  Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">constipation</span>.  Other opioid induced-effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.</p>

<h2>Endocrine System</h2>
<p class="First">Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on the secretion of hormones.  Opioids inhibit the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans.  They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagons in humans and other species, rats and dogs.  Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) has been shown to be both inhibited and stimulated by opioids.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s3.5"></a><a name="section-2.5"></a><p></p>
<h2>Immune System</h2>
<p class="First">Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and animal models.  The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="43681-6">
<a name="s3.6"></a><a name="section-2.6"></a><p></p>
<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">As with all opioids, the minimum effective plasma concentration for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> varies widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids.  As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect.  The minimum effective analgesic concentration of morphine for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, the development of new <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> syndrome and/or the development of analgesic tolerance.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s3.7"></a><a name="section-2.6.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Plasma Level-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">Analgesia</span> Relationships</h3>
<p class="First">In any particular patient, both <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effects</span> and plasma morphine concentrations are related to the morphine dose.  In non-tolerant individuals, plasma morphine concentration-efficacy relationships have been demonstrated and suggest that opiate receptors occupy effector compartments, leading to a lag-time, or hysteresis, between rapid changes in plasma morphine concentrations and the effects of such changes.  The most direct and predictable concentration-effect relationships can, therefore, be expected at distribution equilibrium and/or steady-state conditions.</p>
<p>While plasma morphine-efficacy relationships can be demonstrated in non-tolerant individuals, they are influenced by a wide variety of factors and are not generally useful as a guide to the clinical use of morphine.  The effective dose in opioid-tolerant patients may be significantly greater than the appropriate dose for opioid-naive individuals.  Dosages of morphine should be chosen and must be titrated on the basis of clinical evaluation of the patient and the balance between therapeutic and adverse effects.</p>
<p>For any fixed dose and dosing interval, MS CONTIN will have at steady-state, a lower C<span class="Sub">max</span> and a higher C<span class="Sub">min</span> than conventional morphine.  </p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s3.8"></a><a name="section-2.6.2"></a><p></p>
<h3>Concentration - Adverse Experience Relationships</h3>
<p class="First">MS CONTIN<span class="Sup">Â®</span> Tablets are associated with typical opioid-related adverse experiences.  There is a general relationship between increasing morphine plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse experiences such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, CNS effects, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>.  In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation is altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related side effects, and the relationship is not clinically relevant.</p>
<p>As with all opioids, the dose must be individualized (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s24">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>), because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients.</p>

<h2>PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM</h2>
<p class="First">MS CONTIN is a controlled-release tablet containing morphine sulfate. Morphine is released from MS CONTIN somewhat more slowly than from immediate-release oral preparations.  Following oral administration of a given dose of morphine, the amount ultimately absorbed is essentially the same whether the source is MS CONTIN or an immediate-release formulation.  Because of pre-systemic elimination (i.e., metabolism in the gut wall and liver) only about 40% of the administered dose reaches the central compartment.</p>
<p>Variation in the physical/mechanical properties of a formulation of an oral morphine drug product can affect both its absolute bioavailability and its absorption rate constant (k<span class="Sub">a</span>).  The formulation employed in MS CONTIN has not been shown to affect morphine's oral bioavailability, but does decrease its apparent k<span class="Sub">a</span>.  Other basic pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g., volume of distribution [Vd], elimination rate constant [k<span class="Sub">e</span>], clearance [Cl]), are unchanged as they are fundamental properties of morphine in the organism.  However, in chronic use, the possibility that shifts in metabolite to parent drug ratios may occur cannot be excluded.</p>
<p>When immediate-release oral morphine or MS CONTIN is given on a fixed dosing regimen, steady-state is achieved in about a day.</p>
<p>For a given dose and dosing interval, the AUC and average blood concentration of morphine at steady-state (Css) will be independent of the specific type of oral formulation administered so long as the formulations have the same absolute bioavailability.  The absorption rate of a formulation will, however, affect the maximum (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) and minimum (C<span class="Sub">min</span>) blood levels and the times of their occurrence.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s3.10"></a><a name="section-2.8"></a><p></p>
<h2>Absorption</h2>
<p class="First">Following the administration of immediate-release oral morphine products, approximately fifty percent of the morphine that will reach the central compartment intact reaches it within 30 minutes.  Following the administration of an equal amount of MS CONTIN to normal volunteers, however, this extent of absorption occurs, on average, after 1.5 hours.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s3.11"></a><a name="section-2.9"></a><p></p>
<h2>Food Effects</h2>
<p class="First">The possible effect of food upon the systemic bioavailability of MS CONTIN<span class="Sup">Â®</span> has not been systematically evaluated for all strengths.  One study, conducted with the 30 mg MS CONTIN Tablets, showed no significant differences in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC <span class="Sub">(0-24h)</span> values, whether the tablet was taken while fasting or with a high-fat breakfast.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s3.12"></a><a name="section-2.10"></a><p></p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p class="First">The volume of distribution (Vd) for morphine is approximately 4 liters per kilogram.  Once absorbed, morphine is distributed to skeletal muscle, kidneys, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain.  Morphine also crosses the placental membranes and has been found in breast milk.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s3.13"></a><a name="section-2.11"></a><p></p>
<h2>Metabolism</h2>
<p class="First">Although a small fraction (less than 5%) of morphine is demethylated, for all practical purposes, virtually all morphine is converted to the 3- and 6- (M3G and M6G) glucuronide metabolites.  M3G is present in the highest plasma concentration following oral administration and possesses no significant analgesic activity.  M6G, while possessing analgesic activity, is present in the plasma in low concentrations.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s3.14"></a><a name="section-2.12"></a><p></p>
<h2>Excretion</h2>
<p class="First">The elimination of morphine occurs primarily as renal excretion of morphine-3- glucuronide and its terminal elimination half-life after intravenous administration is normally 2 to 4 hours.  In some studies involving longer periods of plasma sampling, a longer terminal half-life of about 15 hours was reported.  A small amount of the glucuronide conjugate is excreted in the bile, and there is some minor enterohepatic recycling. As with any drug, caution should be taken to guard against unanticipated accumulation if renal and/or hepatic function is seriously impaired.</p>

<h2>Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Opioids</h2>
<p class="First">Morphine is an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance.  Such drugs are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion.</p>
<p>Morphine can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit.  This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing MS CONTIN<span class="Sup">Â®</span> in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion.</p>
<p>MS CONTIN can be abused by crushing, chewing, snorting or injecting the dissolved product.  These practices will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the opioid and pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s13">WARNINGS: Drug Abuse and Addiction</a></span>).</p>

<h2>Drug Abuse and Addiction</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">MS CONTIN is a mu-agonist opioid with an abuse liability similar to other opioid agonists and is a Schedule II controlled substance.  MS CONTIN and other opioids used in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, can be abused and are subject to criminal diversion.</span></p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug addiction</span> is characterized by compulsive use, use for non-medical purposes, and continued use despite harm or risk of harm.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug addiction</span> is a treatable disease, utilizing a multi-disciplinary approach, but relapse is common.</p>
<p>â€œDrug-seekingâ€? behavior is very common in addicts and drug abusers.  Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated â€œlossâ€? of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s).  â€œDoctor shoppingâ€? to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction.</p>
<p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> and tolerance.  Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> in all addicts.  In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction and is characterized by misuse for non-medical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances.  MS CONTIN, like other opioids, has been diverted for non-medical use.  Careful record keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised.</p>
<p>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">MS CONTIN is intended for oral use only as an intact tablet.  Abuse of the crushed tablet poses a hazard of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.  This risk is increased with concurrent abuse of alcohol and other substances. Due to the presence of talc as one of the excipients in tablets, parenteral abuse can be expected to result in local tissue <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4280654" conceptname="Necrosis">necrosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, pulmonary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4163983" conceptname="Granuloma">granulomas</span>, and increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441589" conceptname="Endocarditis">endocarditis</span> and valvular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4016543" conceptname="Injury to heart and lung">heart injury</span>.

<p><span class="Bold">Special precautions regarding MS CONTIN 100 mg and 200 mg Tablets</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">MS CONTIN 100 mg and 200 mg Tablets are for use only in opioid-tolerant patients requiring daily morphine equivalent dosages of  200 or more for the 100 mg tablet and 400 mg or more for the 200 mg tablet.  Care should be taken in its prescription and patients should be instructed against use by individuals other than the patient for whom it was prescribed, as this may have severe medical consequences for that individual.</span></p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34072-9">
<a name="s8.1"></a><a name="section-6.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">MS CONTIN Tablets are a controlled-release oral formulation of morphine sulfate indicated for the management of moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> when a continuous, around-the-clock analgesic is needed for an extended period of time.  MS CONTIN does not release morphine continuously over the course of a dosing interval.  The administration of single doses of MS CONTIN on a q12h dosing schedule will result in higher peak and lower trough plasma levels than those that occur when an identical daily dose of morphine is administered using conventional oral formulations on a q4h regimen.  The clinical significance of greater fluctuations in morphine plasma level has not been systematically evaluated.  (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#s24">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>.)</p>
<p>Selection of patients for treatment with MS CONTIN<span class="Sup">Â®</span> should be governed by the same principles that apply to the use of morphine or other potent opioid analgesics.  Specifically, the increased risks associated with its use in the following populations should be considered: the elderly or debilitated and those with severe impairment of hepatic, pulmonary, or renal function; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4182596" conceptname="Myxedema">myxedema</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140673" conceptname="Hypothyroidism">hypothyroidism</span>; adrenocortical insufficiency (e.g., Addison's Disease); <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>; toxic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychosis</span>; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198803" conceptname="Benign prostatic hyperplasia">prostatic hypertrophy</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="195590" conceptname="Urethral stricture">urethral stricture</span>; acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218106" conceptname="Alcoholism">alcoholism</span>; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377830" conceptname="Alcohol withdrawal delirium">delirium tremens</span>; kyphoscoliosis or inability to swallow.</p>

<h2>Information for Patients/Caregivers</h2>
<p class="First">If clinically advisable, patients receiving MS CONTIN<span class="Sup">Â®</span> or their caregivers should be given the following information by the physician, nurse, or pharmacist:</p>
<ol class="Arabic">
<li>Patients should be advised that MS CONTIN Tablets contain morphine and should be taken only as directed.</li>
<li>Patients should be advised that MS CONTIN Tablets were designed to work properly only if swallowed whole.  MS CONTIN Tablets will release all of their morphine if split, divided, broken, chewed, dissolved, or crushed resulting in the risk of a fatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>.</li>
<li>Patients should be advised not to change the dose of MS CONTIN without consulting their physician.</li>
<li>Patients should be advised to report episodes of breakthrough <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> and adverse experiences occurring during therapy.  Individualization of dosage is essential to make optimal use of this medication.</li>
<li>MS CONTIN may impair mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks (e.g., driving, operating machinery).  Patients started on MS CONTIN or whose dose has been changed should refrain from dangerous activity until it is established that they are not adversely affected.</li>
<li> MS CONTIN should not be taken with alcohol or other CNS depressants (sleep aids, tranquilizers) except by the orders of the prescribing physician because dangerous additive effects may occur resulting in serious injury or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.</li>
<li>Women of childbearing potential who become or are planning to become pregnant should be advised to consult their physician regarding the effects of analgesics and other drug use during pregnancy on themselves and their unborn child.</li>
<li>Patients should be advised that if they have been receiving treatment with MS CONTIN for more than a few weeks and cessation of therapy is indicated, it may be appropriate to taper the MS CONTIN dose, rather than abruptly discontinue it, due to the risk of precipitating withdrawal symptoms.  Their physician can provide a dose schedule to accomplish a gradual discontinuation of the medication.</li>
<li> MS CONTIN<span class="Sup">Â®</span> 100 mg and 200 mg Tablets are for use only in opioid-tolerant patients requiring daily morphine equivalent dosages of  200 mg or more for the 100 mg tablet and 400 mg or more for the 200 mg tablet.  Special care must be taken to avoid accidental ingestion or the use by individuals (including children) other than the patient for whom it was originally prescribed, as such unsupervised use may have severe, even fatal, consequences.</li>
<li>Patients should be advised that MS CONTIN<span class="Sup">Â®</span> is a potential drug of abuse.  They should protect it from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4087298" conceptname="Theft">theft</span>, and it should never be given to anyone other than the individual for whom it was prescribed.</li>
<li>Patients should be advised that they may pass empty matrix "ghosts" (tablets) via colostomy or in the stool, and that this is of no concern since the active medication has already been absorbed.</li>
<li>Patients should be instructed to keep MS CONTIN in a secure place out of the reach of children.

<h3>Teratogenic Effects - CATEGORY C</h3>
<p class="First">Adequate animal studies on reproduction have not been performed to determine whether morphine affects fertility in males or females.  There are no well-controlled studies in women, but marketing experience does not include any evidence of adverse effects on the fetus following routine (short-term) clinical use of morphine sulfate products.  Although there is no clearly defined risk, such experience cannot exclude the possibility of infrequent or subtle damage to the human fetus.</p>
<p>MS CONTIN<span class="Sup">Â®</span> should be used in pregnant women only if the need for strong opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> clearly outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.

<h2>Labor and Delivery</h2>
<p class="First">MS CONTIN is not recommended for use in women during and immediately prior to labor.  Occasionally, opioid analgesics may prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions.  However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation which tends to shorten labor.</p>
<p>Neonates whose mothers received opioid analgesics during labor should be observed closely for signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>.  A specific narcotic antagonist, naloxone, should be available for reversal of narcotic-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> in the neonate.</p>

Neonatal withdrawal syndrome presents as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">hyperactivity</span> and abnormal sleep pattern, abnormal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4136768" conceptname="Crying">crying</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span> and subsequent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> or failure to gain weight, and may result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.  The onset, duration and severity of neonatal withdrawal syndrome varies based on the drug used, duration of use, the and dose of last maternal use, and rate of elimination by the newborn.

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Low levels of <span class="Italics">morphine</span> have been detected in the breast milk.  Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breast-feeding infants when maternal administration of morphine sulfate is stopped.  Ordinarily, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is receiving MS CONTIN since morphine may be excreted in the milk.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of MS CONTIN did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>

<p>The nature of the controlled-release morphine should also be taken into account when treating the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>.

Naloxone should be administered intravenously; however, because its duration of action is relatively short, the patient must be carefully monitored until spontaneous respiration is reliably re-established.  If the response to naloxone is suboptimal or not sustained, additional naloxone may be administered, as needed, or given by continuous infusion to maintain alertness and respiratory function; however, there is no information available about the cumulative dose of naloxone that may be safely administered.</p>
<p>Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> secondary to morphine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>.

<p><span class="Bold">MS CONTIN IS AN OPIOID AGONIST AND A SCHEDULE II CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE WITH AN ABUSE LIABILITY SIMILAR TO OTHER OPIOID AGONISTS.  MORPHINE AND OTHER OPIOIDS USED IN <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">ANALGESIA</span> CAN BE ABUSED AND ARE SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL DIVERSION.</span></p>

<p><span class="Bold">Physicians should individualize treatment in every case, initiating therapy at the appropriate point along a progression from non-opioid analgesics, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen to opioids in a plan of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> management such as those outlined by the World Health Organization, the Federation of State Medical Boards Model Guidelines, or the American <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">Pain</span> Society.  Healthcare professionals should follow appropriate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> management principles of careful assessment and ongoing monitoring (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s31">BOXED WARNING</a></span>).</span></p>
<p>MS CONTIN<span class="Sup">Â®</span> Tablets are a controlled-release oral formulation of morphine sulfate indicated for the management of moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> when a continuous, around-the-clock analgesic is needed for an extended period of time.  The controlled-release nature of the formulation allows it to be administered on a more convenient schedule than conventional immediate-release oral morphine products.  (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#s3">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>; <a href="#s3.9">PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM</a></span>.)  However, MS CONTIN does not release morphine continuously over the course of a dosing interval.  The administration of single doses of MS CONTIN on a q12h dosing schedule will result in higher peak and lower trough plasma levels than those that occur when an identical daily dose of morphine is administered using conventional oral formulations on a q4h regimen.  The clinical significance of greater fluctuations in morphine plasma level has not been systematically evaluated.</p>
<p>As with any potent opioid drug product, it is critical to adjust the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's prior opioid and non-opioid analgesic treatment experience.  Although it is clearly impossible to enumerate every consideration that is important to the selection of initial dose and dosing interval of MS CONTIN, attention should be given to 1) the daily dose, potency, and precise characteristics of the opioid the patient has been taking previously (e.g., whether it is a pure agonist or mixed agonist/antagonist), 2) the reliability of the relative potency estimate used to calculate the dose of morphine needed [N.B. potency estimates may vary with the route of administration], 3) the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, and 4) the general condition and medical status of the patient.</p>
<p>The following dosing recommendations, therefore, can only be considered suggested approaches to what is actually a series of clinical decisions in the management of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> of an individual patient.</p>
<p>During periods of changing analgesic requirements including initial titration, frequent contact is recommended between physician, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family.</p>

<h2>Conversion from Immediate-Release Oral Morphine to MS CONTIN </h2>
<p class="First">A patient's daily morphine requirement is established using immediate-release oral morphine (dosing every 4 to 6 hours).  The patient is then converted to MS CONTIN<span class="Sup">Â®</span> in either of two ways: 1) by administering one-half of the patient's 24-hour requirement as MS CONTIN on an every 12-hour schedule; or, 2) by administering one-third of the patient's daily requirement as MS CONTIN on an every eight hour schedule.  With either method, dose and dosing interval is then adjusted as needed (see discussion below).  The 15 mg tablet should be used for initial conversion for patients whose total daily requirement is expected to be less than 60 mg.  The 30 mg tablet strength is recommended for patients with a daily morphine requirement of 60 to 120 mg.  When the total daily dose is expected to be greater than 120 mg, the appropriate combination of tablet strengths should be employed.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s24.2"></a><a name="section-9.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Conversion from Parenteral Morphine or Other Opioids (Parenteral or Oral) to MS CONTIN</h2>
<p class="First">MS CONTIN can be administered as the initial oral morphine drug product; in this case, however, particular care must be exercised in the conversion process.  Because of uncertainty about, and intersubject variation in, relative estimates of opioid potency and cross tolerance, initial dosing regimens should be conservative.  It is better to underestimate the 24-hour oral morphine requirement than to overestimate.  To this end, initial individual doses of MS CONTIN should be estimated conservatively.  In patients whose daily morphine requirements are expected to be less than or equal to 120 mg per day, the 30 mg tablet strength is recommended for the initial titration period.  Once a stable dose regimen is reached, the patient can be converted to the 60 mg or 100 mg tablet strength, or an appropriate combination of tablet strengths, if desired.</p>
<p>Estimates of the relative potency of opioids are only approximate and are influenced by route of administration, individual patient differences, and possibly, by an individual's medical condition.  Consequently, it is difficult to recommend any fixed rule for converting a patient to MS CONTIN directly.  The following general points should be considered, however.</p>
<ol class="Arabic">
<li>
<span class="Italics">Parenteral to oral morphine ratio</span>: Estimates of the oral to parenteral potency of morphine vary.  Some authorities suggest that a dose of oral morphine only three times the daily parenteral morphine requirement may be sufficient in chronic use settings. </li>
<li>
<span class="Italics">Other parenteral or oral opioids to oral morphine</span>: Because there is lack of systematic evidence bearing on these types of analgesic substitutions, specific recommendations are not possible. </li>
</ol>
<p>Physicians are advised to refer to published relative potency data, keeping in mind that such ratios are only approximate.  In general, it is safer to underestimate the daily dose of MS CONTIN required and rely upon ad hoc supplementation to deal with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012238" conceptname="Inadequate analgesia">inadequate analgesia</span>.

<h2>Use of MS CONTIN as the First Opioid Analgesic</h2>
<p class="First">There has been no systematic evaluation of MS CONTIN as an initial opioid analgesic in the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>.  Because it may be more difficult to titrate a patient using a controlled-release morphine, it is ordinarily advisable to begin treatment using an immediate-release formulation.  (See <span class="Bold">Special Instructions for MS CONTIN<span class="Sup">Â®</span> 100 and 200 mg Tablets)</span></p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s24.4"></a><a name="section-9.4"></a><p></p>
<h2>Considerations in the Adjustment of Dosing Regimens</h2>
<p class="First">Whatever the approach, if signs of excessive opioid effects are observed early in a dosing interval, the next dose should be reduced.  If this adjustment leads to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012238" conceptname="Inadequate analgesia">inadequate analgesia</span>, that is, "breakthrough" <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> occurs late in the dosing interval, the dosing interval may be shortened.  Alternatively, a supplemental dose of a short-acting analgesic may be given.  As experience is gained, adjustments can be made to obtain an appropriate balance between <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relief, opioid side effects, and the convenience of the dosing schedule.</p>
<p>In adjusting dosing requirements, it is recommended that the dosing interval never be extended beyond 12 hours because the administration of very large single doses may lead to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">acute overdose</span>.  (N.B. MS CONTIN is a controlled-release formulation; it does not release morphine continuously over the dosing interval.)</p>
<p>For patients with low daily morphine requirements, the 15 mg tablet should be used.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Special Instructions for MS CONTIN 100 and 200 mg Tablets<br>
(For use in opioid-tolerant patients only.)</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">MS CONTIN 100 mg and 200 mg tablets are for use only in opioid-tolerant patients requiring daily morphine equivalent dosages of 200 mg or more for the 100 mg tablet and 400 mg or more for the 200 mg tablet.  It is recommended that these strengths be reserved for patients that have already been titrated to a stable analgesic regimen using lower strengths of MS CONTIN or other opioids.</span></p>

<p class="First">The intent of the titration period is to establish a patient-specific daily dose that will provide adequate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> with acceptable side effects and minimal rescue doses (2 or less) for as long as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relief is necessary.  Should <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> recur, the dose can be increased to re-establish <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> control as outlined above.  During chronic, around-the-clock opioid therapy, especially for non-cancer <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> syndromes, the continued need for around-the-clock opioid therapy should be reassessed periodically (e.g. every 6 to 12 months) as appropriate.</p>

<h2>Cessation of Therapy</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">When the patient no longer requires therapy with MS CONTIN<span class="Sup">Â®</span> tablets, doses should be tapered gradually to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the physically dependent patient.</span></p>

<h2>Conversion from MS CONTIN to Parenteral Opioids</h2>
<p class="First">When converting a patient from MS CONTIN to parenteral opioids, it is best to assume that the parenteral to oral potency is high.  NOTE THAT THIS IS THE CONVERSE OF THE STRATEGY USED WHEN THE DIRECTION OF CONVERSION IS FROM THE PARENTERAL TO ORAL FORMULATIONS.  IN BOTH CASES, HOWEVER, THE AIM IS TO ESTIMATE THE NEW DOSE CONSERVATIVELY.  For example, to estimate the required 24-hour dose of morphine for IM use, one could employ a conversion of 1 mg of morphine IM for every 6 mg of morphine as MS CONTIN. The IM 24-hour dose would have to be divided by six and administered on a q4h regimen.  This approach is recommended because it is least likely to cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>.</p>

<h1>SAFETY AND HANDLING</h1>
<p class="First">MS CONTIN Tablets contain morphine sulfate which is a controlled substance under Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act. Morphine, like all opioids, is liable to diversion and misuse and should be handled accordingly.  Patients and their families should be instructed to flush any unneeded MS CONTIN tablets down the toilet.	</p>
<p>MS CONTIN may be targeted for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4087298" conceptname="Theft">theft</span> and diversion by criminals.  Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">MS CONTIN TABLETS ARE TO BE SWALLOWED WHOLE, AND ARE NOT TO BE BROKEN, CHEWED, DISSOLVED, OR CRUSHED.  TAKING BROKEN, CHEWED, DISSOLVED, OR CRUSHED MS CONTIN TABLETS LEADS TO RAPID RELEASE AND ABSORPTION OF A POTENTIALLY FATAL DOSE OF MORPHINE.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">MS CONTIN 100 mg and 200 mg tablets are for use only in opioid-tolerant patients requiring daily morphine equivalent dosages of 200 mg or more for the 100 mg tablet and 400 mg or more for the 200 mg tablet.  This strength is potentially fatal if accidentally ingested and patients and their families should be instructed to take special care to avoid accidental or intentional ingestion by individuals other than those for whom the medication was originally prescribed.</span></p>
