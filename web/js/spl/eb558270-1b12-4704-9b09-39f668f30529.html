<h1>1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">AZILECT (rasagiline tablets) is indicated for the treatment of 
the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's disease as initial monotherapy 
and as adjunct therapy to levodopa.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of AZILECT was demonstrated in patients with early 
Parkinson's disease who were receiving AZILECT as monotherapy and who were not 
receiving any concomitant dopaminergic therapy. The effectiveness of AZILECT as 
adjunct therapy was demonstrated in patients with Parkinson's disease who were 
treated with levodopa. </p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34068-7">
<a name="S2"></a><a name="section-2"></a><p></p>
<h1>2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p style="border-left:1px solid;"><span class="XmChange">AZILECT is a selective inhibitor of monoamine
oxidase (MAO)-B at recommended doses of 0.5 or 1 mg daily. Dietary
tyramine restriction is not ordinarily required with recommended doses
of AZILECT. However, certain foods (e.g., aged cheeses, such as Stilton
cheese) may contain very high amounts (i.e., &gt; 150 mg) of tyramine
and could potentially cause a hypertensive "cheese" reaction in
patients taking AZILECT even at the recommended dose due to mild
increased sensitivity to tyramine. The selectivity for inhibiting MAO-B
diminishes in a dose-related manner as the dose is progressively
increased above the recommended daily dose <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#section-8.4"> Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</a>, <a href="#section-15.3"> Clinical Pharmacology (12.3</a>, and <a href="#section-19.3"> Information for Patients (17.3)</a>)]</span>.</span><span class="Italics"></span></p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-2.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>2.1 Monotherapy</h2>
<p class="First">The recommended AZILECT dose for the treatment of Parkinson's 
disease patients is 1 mg administered orally once daily. </p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-2.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>2.2 Adjunctive Therapy</h2>
<p class="First">The recommended initial dose is 0.5 mg administered orally once 
daily. If a sufficient clinical response is not achieved, the dose may be 
increased to 1 mg administered once daily. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><p>Change of Levodopa Dose in Adjunct Therapy</p>
<p>When AZILECT is used in combination with levodopa, a reduction of the 
levodopa dosage may be considered based upon individual response. During the 
controlled trials of AZILECT as adjunct therapy to levodopa, levodopa dosage was 
reduced in some patients. In clinical studies, dosage reduction of levodopa was 
allowed within the first 6 weeks if dopaminergic side effects, including 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047115" conceptname="Oral dyskinesia">dyskinesia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span>, emerged. In Study 1, levodopa dosage reduction 
occurred in 8% of patients in the placebo group and in 16% and 17% of patients 
in the 0.5 mg/day and 1 mg/day rasagiline groups, respectively. In those 
patients who had levodopa dosage reduced, the dose was reduced on average by 
about 7%, 9%, and 13% in the placebo, 0.5 mg/day, and 1 mg/day groups, 
respectively. In Study 2, levodopa dosage reduction occurred in 6% of patients 
in the placebo group and in 9% in the rasagiline 1 mg/day group. In patients who 
had their levodopa dosage reduced, the dose was reduced on average by about 13% 
and 11% in the placebo and the rasagiline groups, respectively.</p>

</p>
<p>AZILECT clinical trials did not allow concomitant use of
fluoxetine or fluvoxamine with AZILECT, but the following
antidepressants and doses were allowed in the AZILECT trials:
amitriptyline ≤ 50 mg/daily, trazodone ≤ 100 mg/daily, citalopram
≤ 20 mg/daily, sertraline ≤ 100 mg/daily and paroxetine ≤ 30
mg/daily.</p>
<p>Although a small number of rasagiline-treated patients were
concomitantly exposed to antidepressants (tricyclics n=115; SSRIs
n=141), the exposure, both in dose and number of subjects, was not
adequate to rule out the possibility of an untoward reaction from
combining these agents. Furthermore, because the mechanisms of these
reactions are not fully understood, it seems prudent, in general, to
avoid the combination of AZILECT with any antidepressant. At least 14
days should elapse between discontinuation of AZILECT and initiation
of treatment with a SSRI, SNRI, tricyclic, tetracyclic, or
triazolopyridine antidepressant. Because of the long half lives of
certain antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine and its active metabolite),
at least five weeks (perhaps longer, especially if fluoxetine has
been prescribed chronically and/or at higher doses) should elapse
between discontinuation of fluoxetine and initiation of AZILECT [see

</h2>
<p class="First">AZILECT is a selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B at 
the recommended doses of 0.5 or 1 mg daily. AZILECT should not be used at daily 
doses exceeding 1 mg/day (or 0.5 mg/day for patients with mild hepatic 
impairment or in patients using concomitant ciprofloxacin or another CYP1A2 
inhibitor) because of the risks of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312938" conceptname="Hypertensive encephalopathy">hypertensive crisis</span> and other adverse

Pharmacology (12.3)</a>]</span>. </p>
<p>Dietary tyramine restriction is not ordinarily required with ingestion of 
most foods and beverages that may contain tyramine, during treatment with 
recommended doses of AZILECT. However, certain foods (e.g., aged cheeses, such 
as Stilton cheese) may contain very high amounts (i.e., &gt; 150 mg) of tyramine 
and could potentially cause a hypertensive "cheese" reaction in patients taking 
AZILECT even at the recommended doses due to mild increased sensitivity to 
tyramine. Patients should be advised to avoid foods (e.g., aged cheese) 
containing a very large amount of tyramine while taking recommended doses of 
AZILECT because of the potential for large increases in blood pressure. 
Selectivity for inhibiting MAO-B diminishes in a dose-related manner as the dose 
is progressively increased above the recommended daily doses. </p>
<p>There were no cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312938" conceptname="Hypertensive encephalopathy">hypertensive crisis</span> in the clinical development

<p>When used as an adjunct to levodopa, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span> were reported as an 
adverse reaction in approximately 5% of patients treated with 0.5 mg/day 
AZILECT, 4% of patients treated with 1 mg/day AZILECT and 3% of patients treated 
with placebo. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">Hallucinations</span> led to drug discontinuation and premature 
withdrawal from clinical trials in about 1% of patients treated with 0.5 mg/day 
or 1 mg/day rasagiline and none of the placebo-treated patients.</p>
<p>Patients should be informed of the possibility of developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span> 
and instructed to report them to their health care provider promptly should they 
develop.</p>
<p>Patients with a major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychotic disorder</span> should ordinarily not be treated 
with AZILECT because of the risk of exacerbating the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychosis</span> with an increase 
in central dopaminergic tone. In addition, many treatments for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychosis</span> that 
decrease in central dopaminergic tone may decrease the effectiveness of AZILECT.

<h2>6.1 Clinical Studies Experience
</h2>
<p class="First">During the clinical development of AZILECT, 1361 Parkinson's 
disease patients received rasagiline as initial monotherapy or as adjunct 
therapy to levodopa. As these two populations differ, not only in the adjunct 
use of levodopa during rasagiline treatment, but also in the severity and 
duration of their disease, they may have differential risks for various adverse 
reactions. Therefore, most of the adverse reactions data in this section are 
presented separately for each population.</p>
<p>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, 
adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be 
directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not 
reflect the rates of adverse reactions observed in practice. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><p>Patients Receiving AZILECT as Initial Monotherapy Treatment 
</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p><span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation 
in Controlled Clinical Studies</span></p>
<p>In the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials conducted in patients 
receiving AZILECT as monotherapy, approximately 5% of the 149 patients treated 
with rasagiline discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared to 2% 
of the 151 patients who received placebo.</p>
<p>The only adverse reaction that led to the discontinuation of more than one 
patient was <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span>.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p><span class="Italics">Adverse Reaction Incidence in Controlled 
Clinical Studies</span></p>
<p>The most commonly observed adverse reactions were those in which the 
treatment difference for the incidence in AZILECT-treated patients was ≥ 3 % 
greater than the incidence in the placebo-treated patients and included flu 
syndrome, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77074" conceptname="Joint pain">arthralgia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="23325" conceptname="Heartburn">dyspepsia</span>. Table 1 lists 
treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 2% of patients receiving 
AZILECT as monotherapy participating in the double-blind, placebo-controlled 
trial and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group.</p>

<a href="http://"></a><p>Other Adverse Reactions Observed During All Phase 2/3 Clinical 
Trials</p>
<p>Rasagiline was administered to approximately 1361 patients during all PD 
phase 2/3 clinical trials. About 283 patients received rasagiline for at least 
one year, approximately 410 patients received rasagiline for at least two years, 
116 patients received rasagiline for at least 3 years, and 245 patients received 
rasagiline for more than 3 years, with some patients treated for more than 5 
years. The long-term safety profile was similar to that observed with shorter 
duration exposure.</p>
<p>The frequencies listed below represent the proportion of the 1361 individuals 
exposed to rasagiline who experienced events of the type cited.</p>
<p>All events that occurred at least twice (or once for serious or potentially 
serious events), except those already listed above, trivial events, terms too 
vague to be meaningful, adverse events with no plausible relation to treatment, 
and events that would be expected in patients of the age studied, were reported 
without regard to determination of a causal relationship to rasagiline. </p>
<p>Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in 
order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse 
events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent 
adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 to 1/1000 
patients and rare adverse events are defined as those occurring in fewer than 
1/1000 patients.</p>

Because these adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of

<h2>7.1 Meperidine</h2>
<p class="First">Serious, sometimes fatal reactions have been precipitated with 
concomitant use of meperidine (e.g., Demerol and other tradenames) and MAO 
inhibitors including selective MAO-B inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#S4.1">Contraindications (4.1)</a>]</span>.</p>

<h2>7.2 Dextromethorphan</h2>
<p class="First">The concomitant use of AZILECT and dextromethorphan was not 
allowed in clinical studies. The combination of MAO inhibitors and 
dextromethorphan has been reported to cause brief episodes of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychosis</span> or 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4092397" conceptname="Bizarre behavior">bizarre behavior</span>. Therefore, in view of AZILECT's MAO inhibitory activity, 
dextromethorphan should not be used concomitantly with AZILECT <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#S4.2">Contraindications (4.2)</a>]</span>.</p>
</div>

<a name="section-7.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>7.3 Sympathomimetic Medications</h2>
<p class="First">The concomitant use of AZILECT and sympathomimetic medications 
was not allowed in clinical studies. Severe hypertensive reactions have followed 
the administration of sympathomimetics and non-selective MAO inhibitors. One 
case of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312938" conceptname="Hypertensive encephalopathy">hypertensive crisis</span> has been reported in a patient taking the 
recommended dose of a selective MAO-B inhibitor and a sympathomimetic medication 
(ephedrine). Elevated blood pressure was reported in another patient taking the 
recommended dose of AZILECT and ophthalmic drops with a sympathomimetic 
medication (tetrahydrozoline). </p>
<p>Because AZILECT is a selective MAOI, hypertensive reactions are not 
ordinarily expected with the concomitant use of sympathomimetic medications. 
Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when concomitantly using recommended 
doses of AZILECT with any sympathomimetic medications including nasal, oral, and 
ophthalmic decongestants and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">cold</span> remedies.</p>

<h2>7.9 Tyramine/Rasagiline Interaction
</h2>
<p class="First">MAO in the gastrointestinal tract and liver (primarily type A) is 
thought to provide vital protection from exogenous amines (e.g., tyramine) that 
have the capacity, if absorbed intact, to cause a "<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312938" conceptname="Hypertensive encephalopathy">hypertensive crisis</span>," the 
so-called "cheese reaction". If large amounts of certain exogenous amines (e.g., 
from fermented cheese, herring, over-the-counter <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span>/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">cold</span> medications) gain 
access to the systemic circulation because MAO-A has been inhibited, they cause 
release of norepinephrine which may result in a rise in systemic blood pressure. 
MAOIs that selectively inhibit MAO-B are largely devoid of the potential to 
cause tyramine-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312938" conceptname="Hypertensive encephalopathy">hypertensive crisis</span>.</p>
<p>Results of a special tyramine challenge study indicate that rasagiline is 
selective for MAO-B at recommended doses and can ordinarily be used without 
dietary tyramine restriction. However, certain foods (e.g., aged cheeses, such 
as Stilton cheese) may contain very high amounts (i.e., &gt; 150 mg) of tyramine 
and could potentially cause a hypertensive cheese reaction in patients taking 
AZILECT due to mild increased sensitivity to tyramine. Patients should be 
advised to avoid foods (e.g., aged cheese) containing a very large amount of 
tyramine while taking recommended doses of AZILECT because of the potential for 
large increases in blood pressure. Selectivity for inhibiting MAO-B diminishes 
in a dose-related manner as the dose is progressively increased above the 
recommended daily doses. </p>
<p>There were no cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312938" conceptname="Hypertensive encephalopathy">hypertensive crisis</span> in the clinical development 
program associated with 1 mg daily rasagiline treatment, in which most patients 
did not follow dietary tyramine restriction.</p>
<p>Despite the selective inhibition of MAO-B at recommended doses of AZILECT, 
there have been post-marketing reports of patients who experienced significantly 
elevated blood pressure (including rare cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312938" conceptname="Hypertensive encephalopathy">hypertensive crisis</span>) after 
ingestion of unknown amounts of tyramine-rich foods while taking recommended

<h2>8.1 Pregnancy</h2>
<p class="First">Category C</p>
<p>No effect on embryo-fetal development was observed in a combined 
mating/fertility and embryo-fetal development study in female rats at doses up 
to 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 30 times the expected plasma rasagiline exposure 
(AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD, 1 mg/day]). Effects on 
embryo-fetal development in rabbit have not been adequately assessed.</p>
<p>In a study in which pregnant rats were dosed with rasagiline (0.1, 0.3, 1 
mg/kg/day) orally, from the beginning of organogenesis to day 20 post-partum, 
offspring survival was decreased and offspring body weight was reduced at doses 
of 0.3 mg/kg/day and 1 mg/kg/day (10 and 16 times the expected plasma rasagiline 
exposure [AUC] at the MRHD). No plasma data were available at the no-effect dose 
(0.1 mg/kg); however, that dose is 1 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. Rasagiline's effect on physical and behavioral 
development was not adequately assessed in this study.</p>
<p>Rasagiline may be given as an adjunct therapy to levodopa/carbidopa 
treatment. In a study in which pregnant rats were dosed with rasagiline (0.1, 
0.3, 1 mg/kg/day) and levodopa/carbidopa (80/20 mg/kg/day) (alone and in 
combination) throughout the period of organogenesis, there was an increased 
incidence of wavy ribs in fetuses from rats treated with rasagiline in 
combination with levodopa/carbidopa at 1/80/20 mg/kg/day (approximately 8 times 
the plasma AUC expected in humans at the MRHD and 1/1 times the MRHD of 
levodopa/carbidopa [800/200 mg/day] on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). In 
a study in which pregnant rabbits were dosed throughout the period of 
organogenesis with rasagiline alone (3 mg/kg) or in combination with 
levodopa/carbidopa (rasagiline: 0.1, 0.6, 1.2 mg/kg, levodopa/carbidopa: 80/20 
mg/kg/day), an increase in embryo-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079844" conceptname="Fetal death">fetal death</span> was noted at rasagiline doses of 
0.6 and 1.2 mg/kg/day when administered in combination with levodopa/carbidopa 
(approximately 7 and 13 times, respectively, the plasma rasagiline AUC at the 
MRHD). There was an increase in cardiovascular abnormalities with 
levodopa/carbidopa alone (1/1 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> 
basis) and to a greater extent when rasagiline (at all doses; 1-13 times the 
plasma rasagiline AUC at the MRHD) was administered in combination with 
levodopa/carbidopa. </p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of rasagiline in pregnant 
women. Therefore, AZILECT should be used during pregnancy only if the potential 
benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. </p>

<h1>10 OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">No cases of AZILECT <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> were reported in clinical 
trials.</p>
<p>Rasagiline was well tolerated in a single-dose study in healthy volunteers 
receiving 20 mg/day and in a ten-day study in healthy volunteers receiving 10 
mg/day. Adverse events were mild or moderate. In a dose escalation study in 
patients on chronic levodopa therapy treated with 10 mg of rasagiline there were 
three reports of cardiovascular side effects (including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> and 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span>) which resolved following treatment discontinuation.</p>
<p>Symptoms of overdosage, although not observed with rasagiline during clinical 
development, may resemble those observed with non-selective MAO inhibitors 
(MAOIs). </p>
<p>Although no cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> have been observed with rasagiline during the 
clinical development program, the following description of presenting symptoms 
and clinical course is based upon <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> descriptions of non-selective MAO 
inhibitors.</p>
<p>Characteristically, signs and symptoms of non-selective MAOI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> may not 
appear immediately. Delays of up to 12 hours between ingestion of drug and the 
appearance of signs may occur. Importantly, the peak intensity of the syndrome 
may not be reached for upwards of a day following the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Death</span> has been

continuous patient observation and monitoring for a period of at least two days 
following the ingestion of such drugs in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, is strongly recommended. </p>
<p>The clinical picture of MAOI <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> varies considerably; its severity may 
be a function of the amount of drug consumed. The central nervous and

<h2>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">AZILECT functions as a selective, irreversible MAO-B inhibitor 
indicated for the treatment of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The results of a 
clinical trial designed to examine the effects of Azilect on blood pressure when 
it is administered with increasing doses of tyramine indicates the functional 
selectivity can be incomplete when healthy subjects ingest large amounts of 
tyramine while receiving recommended doses of AZILECT. The selectivity for 
inhibiting MAO-B diminishes in a dose-related manner. </p>
<p>MAO, a flavin-containing enzyme, is classified into two major molecular 
species, A and B, and is localized in mitochondrial membranes throughout the 
body in nerve terminals, brain, liver and intestinal mucosa. MAO regulates the 
metabolic degradation of catecholamines and serotonin in the CNS and peripheral 
tissues. MAO-B is the major form in the human brain. In <span class="Italics">ex 
vivo</span> animal studies in brain, liver and intestinal tissues, rasagiline 
was shown to be a potent, irreversible monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) 
selective inhibitor. Rasagiline at the recommended therapeutic dose was also 
shown to be a potent and irreversible inhibitor of MAO-B in platelets. The 
precise mechanisms of action of rasagiline are unknown. One mechanism is 
believed to be related to its MAO-B inhibitory activity, which causes an 
increase in extracellular levels of dopamine in the striatum. The elevated 
dopamine level and subsequent increased dopaminergic activity are likely to 
mediate rasagiline's beneficial effects seen in models of dopaminergic motor 
dysfunction. </p>

<h2>12.2 Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">Platelet MAO Activity in Clinical Studies</p>
<p>Studies in healthy subjects and in Parkinson's disease patients have shown 
that rasagiline inhibits platelet MAO-B irreversibly. The inhibition lasts at 
least 1 week after last dose. Almost 25-35% MAO-B inhibition was achieved after 
a single rasagiline dose of 1 mg/day and more than 55% of MAO-B inhibition was 
achieved after a single rasagiline dose of 2 mg/day. Over 90% inhibition was 
achieved 3 days after rasagiline daily dosing at 2 mg/day and this inhibition 
level was maintained 3 days post-dose. Multiple doses of rasagiline of 0.5, 1 
and 2 mg per day resulted in complete MAO-B inhibition. </p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="43682-4">
<a name="section-12.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>12.3 Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Rasagiline in the range of 1-6 mg demonstrated a more than 
proportional increase in AUC, while Cmax was dose proportional. Rasagiline mean 
steady-state half life is 3 hours but there is no correlation of 
pharmacokinetics with its pharmacological effect because of its irreversible 
inhibition of MAO-B. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><p>Absorption</p>
<p>Rasagiline is rapidly absorbed, reaching peak plasma concentration (Cmax) in 
approximately 1 hour. The absolute bioavailability of rasagiline is about 
36%.</p>
<p>Food does not affect the Tmax of rasagiline, although Cmax and exposure (AUC) 
are decreased by approximately 60% and 20%, respectively, when the drug is taken 
with a high fat meal. Because AUC is not significantly affected, AZILECT can be 
administered with or without food <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#S2">Dosage 
and Administration (2)</a>]</span>.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p>Distribution</p>
<p>The mean volume of distribution at steady-state is 87 L, indicating that the 
tissue binding of rasagiline is in excess of plasma protein binding. Plasma 
protein binding ranges from 88-94% with mean extent of binding of 61-63% to 
human albumin over the concentration range of 1-100 ng/mL.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><p>Metabolism and Elimination</p>
<p>Rasagiline undergoes almost complete biotransformation in the liver prior to 
excretion. The metabolism of rasagiline proceeds through two main pathways: 
N-dealkylation and/or hydroxylation to yield 1-aminoindan (AI), 
3-hydroxy-N-propargyl-1 aminoindan (3-OH-PAI) and 3-hydroxy-1-aminoindan 
(3-OH-AI). <span class="Italics">In vitro </span>experiments indicate that both 
routes of rasagiline metabolism are dependent on the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
system, with CYP1A2 being the major isoenzyme involved in rasagiline metabolism. 
Glucuronide conjugation of rasagiline and its metabolites, with subsequent 
urinary excretion, is the major elimination pathway.</p>
<p>After oral administration of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-labeled rasagiline, 
elimination occurred primarily via urine and secondarily via feces (62% of total 
dose in urine and 7% of total dose in feces over 7 days), with a total 
calculated recovery of 84% of the dose over a period of 38 days. Less than 1% of 
rasagiline was excreted as unchanged drug in urine.</p>

<h2>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
</h2>
<p class="First">Carcinogenesis</p>
<p>Two year carcinogenicity studies were conducted in CD-1 mice at oral (gavage) 
doses of 1, 15, and 45 mg/kg and in Sprague-Dawley rats at oral (gavage) doses 
of 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg (males) or 0.5, 2, 5, and 17 mg/kg (females). In rats, 
there was no increase in tumors at any dose tested. Plasma exposures at the 
highest dose tested were approximately 33 and 260 times, in male and female 
rats, respectively, the expected plasma exposures in humans at the maximum 
recommended dose (MRD) of 1 mg/day. </p>
<p>In mice, there was an increase in lung tumors (combined <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span>/carcinomas) 
at 15 and 45 mg/kg males and females. Plasma exposures associated with the 
no-effect dose (1 mg/kg) were approximately 5 times those expected in humans at 
the MRD. </p>
<p>The carcinogenic potential of rasagiline administered in combination with 
levodopa/carbidopa has not been examined. </p>
<a href="http://"></a><p>Mutagenesis</p>

<h1>14 CLINICAL TRIALS</h1>
<p class="First">The effectiveness of AZILECT for the treatment of Parkinson's 
disease was established in three 18- to 26-week, randomized, placebo-controlled 
trials. In one of these trials AZILECT was given as initial monotherapy and in 
the other two as adjunctive therapy to levodopa.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-14.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>14.1 Monotherapy Use of AZILECT</h2>
<p class="First">The monotherapy trial was a double-blind, randomized, fixed-dose 
parallel group, 26-week study in early Parkinson's disease patients not 
receiving any concomitant dopaminergic therapy at the start of the study. The 
majority of the patients were not treated with any anti-Parkinson's disease 
medication before receiving rasagiline treatment.</p>
<p>In this trial, 404 patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (138 
patients), rasagiline 1 mg/day (134 patients) or rasagiline 2 mg/day (132 
patients). Patients were not allowed to take levodopa, dopamine agonists, 
selegiline or amantadine, but if necessary, could take stable doses of 
anticholinergic medication. The average Parkinson's disease duration was 
approximately 1 year (range 0 to 11 years).</p>
<p>The primary measure of effectiveness was the change from baseline in the 
total score of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), [mentation 
(Part I) + activities of daily living (ADL) (Part II) + motor function (Part 
III)]. The UPDRS is a multi-item rating scale that measures the ability of a 
patient to perform mental and motor tasks as well as activities of daily living. 
A reduction in the score represents improvement and a beneficial change from 
baseline appears as a negative number.</p>
<p>Rasagiline (1 or 2 mg once daily) had a significant beneficial effect 
relative to placebo on the primary measure of effectiveness in patients 
receiving six months of treatment and not on dopaminergic therapy. Patients who 
received rasagiline had significantly less worsening in the UPDRS score, 
compared to those who received placebo. The effectiveness of rasagiline 1 mg and 
2 mg was comparable. Table 3 displays the results of the monotherapy 
trial.</p>

<h2>14.2 Adjunctive use of AZILECT</h2>
<p class="First">Two multicenter, randomized, multinational trials were conducted 
in more advanced Parkinson's disease patients treated chronically with levodopa 
and experiencing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142980" conceptname="On - off phenomenon">motor fluctuations</span> (including but not limited to, end of dose 
"wearing off," sudden or random "off," etc.). The first (Study 1) was conducted 
in North America (U.S. and Canada) and compared two doses (0.5 mg and 1 mg 
daily) of rasagiline and placebo while the second (Study 2) was conducted 
outside of North America (several European countries, Argentina, Israel) and 
studied only a single dose (1 mg daily) of rasagiline and placebo. Patients had 
had Parkinson's disease for an average of 9 years (range 5 months to 33 years), 
had been taking levodopa for an average of 8 years (range 5 months to 32 years), 
and had been experiencing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142980" conceptname="On - off phenomenon">motor fluctuations</span> for approximately 3 to 4 years 
(range 1 month to 23 years). Patients kept home diaries just prior to baseline 
and at specified intervals during the trial. Diaries recorded one of the 
following four conditions for each half-hour interval over a 24-hour period: 
"ON" (period of relatively good function and mobility) as either "ON" with no 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047115" conceptname="Oral dyskinesia">dyskinesia</span> or without troublesome <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047115" conceptname="Oral dyskinesia">dyskinesia</span>, or "ON" with troublesome 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047115" conceptname="Oral dyskinesia">dyskinesia</span>, "OFF" (period of relatively poor function and mobility) or asleep. 
"Troublesome" <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047115" conceptname="Oral dyskinesia">dyskinesia</span> is defined as that which interferes with the patient's 
daily activity. All patients had been inadequately controlled and were 
experiencing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142980" conceptname="On - off phenomenon">motor fluctuations</span> typical of advanced stage disease despite 
receiving levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitor. The average dose of 
levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitor was approximately 700 to 800 mg (range 150 to 
3000 mg/day). Patients were also allowed to take stable doses of additional 
anti-PD medications at entry into the trials. In both trials, approximately 65% 
of patients were on dopamine agonists and in the North American study (Study 1) 
approximately 35% were on entacapone. The majority of patients taking entacapone 
were taking a dopamine agonist as well.</p>
<p>In both trials the primary measure of effectiveness was the change in the 
mean number of hours that were spent in the "OFF" state at baseline compared to 
the mean number of hours that were spent in the "OFF" state during the treatment 
period.</p>
<p>The first adjunct study (Study 1) was a double-blind, randomized, fixed-dose, 
parallel group trial conducted in 472 levodopa-treated Parkinson's disease 
patients who were experiencing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142980" conceptname="On - off phenomenon">motor fluctuations</span>. Patients were randomly 
assigned to receive placebo (159 patients), rasagiline 0.5 mg/day (164 
patients), or rasagiline 1 mg/day (149 patients), and were treated for 26 weeks. 
Patients averaged approximately 6 hours daily in the "OFF" state at baseline, as 
confirmed by home diaries.</p>
<p>The second adjunct study (Study 2) was a double-blind, randomized, parallel 
group trial conducted in 687 levodopa-treated Parkinson's disease patients who 
were experiencing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142980" conceptname="On - off phenomenon">motor fluctuations</span>. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 
placebo (229 patients), rasagiline 1 mg/day (231 patients) or an active 
comparator, a COMT inhibitor taken along with scheduled doses of 
levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitor (227 patients). Patients were treated for 18 
weeks. Patients averaged approximately 5.6 hours daily in the "OFF" state at 
baseline as confirmed by home diaries. </p>
<p>In both studies, rasagiline 1 mg once daily reduced "OFF" time compared to 
placebo when added to levodopa in patients experiencing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142980" conceptname="On - off phenomenon">motor fluctuations</span> 
(Tables 4 and 5). The lower dose (0.5 mg) of rasagiline also significantly 
reduced "OFF" time (Table 4), but had a numerically smaller effect than the 1 mg 
dose of rasagiline. In Study 2, the active comparator also reduced "OFF" time 
when compared to placebo.</p>

<p>For the comparison between rasagiline 1 mg/day and placebo in both studies, 
no differences in effectiveness based on age or gender were detected.</p>
<p>Several secondary outcome assessments in the two studies showed statistically 
significant improvements with rasagiline. These included effects on the 
activities of daily living (ADL) subscale of the UPDRS performed during an "OFF"

<p class="First">Patients should be advised not to exceed the maximum recommended 
daily dose of 1 mg/day (0.5 mg/day for subjects with mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> and 
subjects using concomitant ciprofloxacin and other CYP1A2 inhibitors). </p>
<p>The risk of using higher than recommended daily doses of AZILECT should be 
explained, and a brief description of the hypertensive/cheese reaction provided. 
</p>
<p>The possibility exists that very tyramine-rich foods (e.g., aged cheese such 
as Stilton) could possibly cause an increase in blood pressure. Patients should 
be advised to avoid certain foods (e.g., aged cheese) containing a very large 
amount of tyramine while taking recommended doses of AZILECT because of the 
potential for large increases in blood pressure. If patients eat foods very rich 
in tyramine and do not feel well soon after eating, they should contact their 
healthcare provider <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#S5.4">Warnings and 
Precautions (5.4)</a>]</span>.</p>

<h2>17.11 Impulse Control / Compulsive Behaviors</h2>
<p class="First">There have been reports of patients experiencing intense urges to 
gamble, increased sexual urges, other intense urges, and the inability to 
control these urges while taking one or more of the medications that increase 
central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of 
Parkinson's disease (including AZILECT). Although it is not proven that the 
medications caused these events, these urges were reported to have stopped in 
some cases when the dose was reduced or the medication was stopped. Prescribers 
should ask patients about the development of new or increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4023166" conceptname="Gambling">gambling</span> urges, 
sexual urges, or other urges while being treated with rasagiline. Patients 
should inform their physician if they experience new or increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4023166" conceptname="Gambling">gambling</span> 
urges, increased sexual urges, or other intense urges while taking rasagiline. 
Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a 
patient develops such urges while taking rasagiline.</p>
