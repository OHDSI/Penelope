<a href="http://"></a>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>12.1 Mechanism Of Action<p class="First">Morphine sulfate, a pure opioid agonist, is relatively selective 
for the mu receptor, although it can interact with other opioid receptors at 
higher doses. In addition to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, the widely diverse effects of morphine 
sulfate include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4148767" conceptname="Dysphoric mood">dysphoria</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142453" conceptname="Feeling high">euphoria</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, respiratory 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, diminished gastrointestinal motility, altered circulatory dynamics, 
histamine release, physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>, and alterations of the endocrine and 
autonomic nervous systems.</p>
<p>Morphine produces both its therapeutic and its adverse effects by interaction 
with one or more classes of specific opioid receptors located throughout the 
body. Morphine acts as a pure agonist, binding with and activating opioid 
receptors at sites in the peri-aqueductal and peri-ventricular grey matter, the 
ventro-medial medulla and the spinal cord to produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Underline">Effects on the Central Nervous 
System</span></span></p>
<p>The principal actions of therapeutic value of morphine are <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> and 
sedation (i.e., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> and anxiolysis). Specific CNS opiate receptors and 
endogenous compounds with morphine-like activity have been identified throughout 
the brain and spinal cord and are likely to play a role in the expression of 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effects</span>. In addition, when morphine binds to mu-opioid receptors, it 
results in positive subjective effects, such as drug liking, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142453" conceptname="Feeling high">euphoria</span>, and high. 
Morphine produces <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> by direct action on brainstem 
respiratory centers. The mechanism of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> involves a 
reduction in the responsiveness of the brainstem respiratory centers to 
increases in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135927" conceptname="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4200706" conceptname="Tension">tension</span>, and to electrical stimulation. Morphine 
depresses the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> reflex by direct effect on the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> center in the medulla. 
Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>. Morphine causes <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435279" conceptname="Tonic pupillary reaction">miosis</span>, even in total darkness, and little tolerance 
develops to this effect. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> but are 
not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may 
produce similar findings). Marked <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4290615" conceptname="Dilated pupil">mydriasis</span> rather than <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435279" conceptname="Tonic pupillary reaction">miosis</span> may be seen with

<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Underline">Effects on the Gastrointestinal 
Tract and Other Smooth Muscle</span></span></p>
<p>Gastric, biliary, and pancreatic secretions are decreased by morphine. 
Morphine causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in tone in 
the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine 
is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic 
waves in the colon are decreased, while tone is increased to the point of spasm. 
The end result is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">constipation</span>. Morphine can cause a marked increase in biliary 
tract pressure as a result of spasm of the sphincter of Oddi.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Underline">Effects on the Cardiovascular

<p>Morphine produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic

Naltrexone</span></span></p>
<p>Naltrexone is a pure, centrally acting mu-opioid antagonist that reverses the 
subjective and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effects</span> of mu-opioid receptor agonists by competitively

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>12.2 Pharmacodynamics<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Underline">Plasma Level-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">Analgesia</span> 
Relationships</span></span></p>
<p>In any particular patient, both <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effects</span> and plasma morphine 
concentrations are related to the morphine dose.</p>
<p>While plasma morphine-efficacy relationships can be demonstrated in 
non-tolerant individuals, they are influenced by a wide variety of factors and 
are not generally useful as a guide to the clinical use of morphine. The 
effective dose in opioid-tolerant patients may be 10-50 times as great (or 
greater) than the appropriate dose for opioid-naÃ¯ve individuals. Dosages of 
morphine should be chosen and must be titrated on the basis of clinical 
evaluation of the patient and the balance between therapeutic and adverse 
effects.</p>
<p>For any fixed dose and dosing interval, EMBEDA will have, at steady-state, a 
lower C<span class="Sub">max</span> and a higher C<span class="Sub">min</span> than 
conventional immediate-release morphine.</p>
<p>The pharmacodynamic effect of naltrexone in the setting of crushed EMBEDA was 
examined in two clinical trials. In a randomized double-blind, triple-dummy, 
four-way cross-over study, 32 non-dependent recreational opioid users received 
120 mg of EMBEDA whole and crushed, 120 mg of immediate-release morphine sulfate 
and placebo. Overall, 87.5% of subjects had some degree of reduced drug liking 
after receiving crushed EMBEDA, while 12.5% had no reduction in drug liking. 
There was considerable individual variability in the degree of reduction in drug 
liking, ranging between 10 and 50%. Similarly, 69% of subjects showed some 
degree of a decrease in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142453" conceptname="Feeling high">euphoria</span> with crushed EMBEDA compared to IR morphine and 
31% of subjects did not report a reduction in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142453" conceptname="Feeling high">euphoria</span>. There was similar 
individual variability in the degree of reduction in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142453" conceptname="Feeling high">euphoria</span>. </p>
<p>A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way cross-over trial in 
28 non-dependent recreational opioid-users was performed using 30 mg of IV 
morphine alone and 30 mg of IV morphine in combination with 1.2 mg of IV 
naltrexone to simulate parenteral use of crushed EMBEDA. The combination of 
morphine with naltrexone resulted in 71% of subjects reporting a reduction in 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142453" conceptname="Feeling high">euphoria</span> compared to morphine alone. Note that the intravenous injection of 
crushed EMBEDA may result in serious injury and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> due to a morphine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> 
or an embolic event. Intravenous injection of crushed EMBEDA may preciptitate a 
severe withdrawal syndrome in opioid-dependent patients. </p>
<p>The clinical significance of the degree of reduction in drug liking and 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142453" conceptname="Feeling high">euphoria</span> reported in these studies has not yet been established. There is no 
evidence that the naltrexone in EMBEDA reduces the abuse liability of 
EMBEDA.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>12.3 Pharmacokinetics<p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p>
<p>EMBEDA Capsules contain extended-release pellets of morphine sulfate that 
release morphine slowly compared to an oral morphine solution. Following the 
administration of oral morphine solution, approximately 50% of the morphine 
absorbed reaches the systemic circulation within 30 minutes. However, following 
the administration of an equal amount of EMBEDA to healthy volunteers, this 
occurs, on average, after 8 hours. As with most forms of oral morphine, because 
of pre-systemic elimination, only about 20 to 40% of the administered dose 
reaches the systemic circulation. </p>
<p>EMBEDA is bioequivalent to a similar morphine sulfate extended release 
capsules product with regard to rate and extent of plasma morphine absorption. 
The median time to peak plasma morphine levels (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) was 
shorter for EMBEDA (7.5 hrs) compared to KADIAN<span class="Sup">Â®</span> (10 
hrs). Dose-related increase in steady-state pre-dose plasma concentrations of 
morphine were noted following multiple dose administration of EMBEDA in 
patients. </p>
<p><span class="Underline">Food effect</span>: While concurrent administration of 
high fat food decreases the rate and extent of morphine absorption from EMBEDA, 
the total bioavailability is not affected. Co-administration of a high-fat meal 
with EMBEDA did not compromise sequestration of naltrexone.</p>
<p>When taken as directed, the sequestered naltrexone in EMBEDA is not 
consistently absorbed into systemic circulation following single dose 
administration. In some subjects, a limited number (~2%) of blood samples had 
low and highly variable plasma naltrexone levels (median = 7.74 pg/mL, range 
4.05-132 pg/mL) following single dose administration of 60 â€“ 120 mg EMBEDA 
compared to oral naltrexone solution. In patients titrated up to 60 â€“ 80 mg BID 
EMBEDA, naltrexone levels (4-25.5 pg/mL) were detected in 13 out of 67 patients 
at steady-state. In a long-term safety study where an average dose of EMBEDA was 
up to 860 mg administered twice a day for 12 months, 11.0% of blood samples at 
pre-dose timepoints at steady-state had detectable plasma naltrexone 
concentrations ranging from 4.03 to 145 pg/mL.</p>
<p>Compared to 2.4 mg naltrexone oral solution, which produced mean (SD) 
naltrexone plasma levels of 689 (<span class="Underline">+</span> 429 pg/mL) and 
mean (SD) 6Î²-naltrexol plasma levels of 3920 (<span class="Underline">+</span> 
1350 pg/mL), administration of intact 60 mg EMBEDA produced no naltrexone plasma 
levels and mean (SD) 6Î²-naltrexol plasma levels of 16.7 (<span class="Underline">+</span> 13.5 pg/mL). Trough levels of plasma naltrexone and 
6-Î²-naltrexol did not accumulate upon repeated administration of EMBEDA. </p>
<p>Tampering with the EMBEDA formulation by crushing or chewing the pellets, 
results in the rapid release and absorption of both morphine and naltrexone 
comparable to an oral solution. This has not been shown to reduce the abuse 
liability of EMBEDA.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p>
<p>Once absorbed, morphine is distributed to skeletal muscle, kidneys, liver, 
intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. The volume of distribution of 
morphine is approximately 3 to 4 L/kg. Morphine is 30 to 35% reversibly bound to 
plasma proteins. Although the primary site of action of morphine is in the CNS, 
only small quantities pass the blood brain barrier. Morphine also crosses the 
placental membranes <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#i4i_pregnancy_id_abf1f54f-56e4-48e7-9f43-1d2c16391baa">USE IN SPECIFIC 
POPULATIONS (8.1)</a>]</span> and has been found in breast milk <span class="Italics">[see <span class="Italics"><a href="#i4i_pregnancy_id_abf1f54f-56e4-48e7-9f43-1d2c16391baa">USE IN SPECIFIC 
POPULATIONS (8.3)</a></span>]</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p>
<p>Major pathways of morphine metabolism include glucuronidation and sulfation 
in the liver to produce including morphine-3-glucuronide, M3G (about 50%) and 
morphine-6-glucuronide, M6G (about 5 to 15%) or morphine-3-etheral sulfate. A 
small fraction (less than 5%) of morphine is demethylated. M3G has no 
significant contribution to the analgesic activity. Although M6G does not 
readily cross the blood-brain barrier, it has been shown to have opioid agonist 
and analgesic activity in humans.</p>
<p>Naltrexone is extensively metabolized into 6-Î²-naltrexol. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Excretion</span></p>
<p>Approximately 10% of morphine dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. 
Elimination of morphine is primarily via hepatic metabolism to glucuronide 
metabolites M3G and M6G (55 to 65%) which are then renally excreted. A small 
amount of the glucuronide metabolites is excreted in the bile and there is some 
minor enterohepatic cycling. </p>
<p>The mean adult plasma clearance is about 20-30 mL/minute/kg. The effective 
half-life of morphine after IV administration is reported to be approximately 
2.0 hours. The terminal elimination half-life of morphine following single dose 
EMBEDA administration is approximately 29 hours.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Special Populations</span></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Geriatric</span>: Pharmacokinetics of EMBEDA have not 
been investigated in elderly patients (greater than 65 years) although such patients were 
included in clinical studies. However, in a long-term open label safety study, 
the pre-dose plasma morphine concentrations after dose normalization were 
similar for subjects less than 65 years and those greater than or equal to 65 years of age <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#i4i_geriatric_use_id_7d3619a2-c775-4739-a3fd-cf9d18de339c">USE IN 
SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.5)</a>].</span></p>
<p><span class="Underline">Pediatric</span>: Pharmacokinetics of EMBEDA were not 
evaluated in pediatric population. </p>
<p><span class="Underline">Gender</span>: No meaningful differences were noted 
between male and female patients in the analysis of pharmacokinetic data of 
morphine from clinical studies.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Race:</span> Pharmacokinetic differences due to race 
may exist. Additionally, Chinese subjects given intravenous morphine in one 
study had a higher clearance when compared to Caucasian subjects (1852 <span class="Underline">+</span> 116 mL/min versus 1495 <span class="Underline">+</span> 
80 mL/min).</p>
<p><span class="Underline"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">Hepatic Failure</span></span>: The pharmacokinetics of 
morphine was found to be significantly altered in individuals with alcoholic 
cirrhosis. The clearance was found to decrease with a corresponding increase in 
half-life. The morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) to 
morphine plasma AUC ratios also decreased in these patients indicating a 
decrease in metabolic activity.</p>
<p><span class="Underline"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span>:</span> The pharmacokinetics of 
morphine is altered in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> patients. AUC is increased and clearance is 
decreased. The metabolites, M3G and M6G, accumulate several fold in renal 
failure patients compared with healthy subjects.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Drug Interaction/Alcohol Interaction:</span> As such 
additive pharmacodynamic effects may be expected when EMBEDA is used in 
conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs that cause central 
nervous system <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>. Additionally, a pharmacokinetic drug interaction is 
noted with concomitant administration of 40% alcohol and EMBEDA, where an 
average 2-fold (range 1.4- to 5-fold increase) higher C<span class="Sub">max</span> of morphine was noted compared to EMBEDA consumed with 
water</p>

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>5.1 Misuse, Abuse, and Diversion of Opioids<p>EMBEDA contains morphine, an opioid agonist, and is a Schedule II 
controlled substance. Opioid agonists have the potential for being abused and 
are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject 
to criminal diversion.</p>
<p>Morphine can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or 
illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing EMBEDA in 
situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased 
risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion.</p>
<p>Abuse of EMBEDA by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved 
product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the opioid and pose a 
significant risk to the abuser that could result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#i4i_abuse_dependence_id_a3c15cdb-35f3-48f2-95b5-f353522bea84">DRUG ABUSE

of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional 
Licensing Board or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>10.2 Treatment<p>Primary attention should be given to the re-establishment of a 
patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled 
ventilation if needed. Other supportive measures (including oxygen, 
vasopressors) should be employed in the management of circulatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">shock</span> and 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4078925" conceptname="Pulmonary edema">pulmonary edema</span> accompanying <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> as indicated. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321042" conceptname="Cardiac arrest">Cardiac arrest</span> or 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span> will require advanced life support techniques.</p>
<p>The pure opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> which results from opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. Since the duration of 
reversal would be expected to be less than the duration of action of morphine in 
EMBEDA, the patient must be carefully monitored until spontaneous respiration is 
reliably re-established. EMBEDA will continue to release and add to the morphine 
load for up to 24 hours after administration and the management of an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> 
should be monitored accordingly. If the response to opioid antagonists is 
suboptimal or not sustained, additional antagonist should be given as directed 
by the manufacturer of the product.</p>
<p>Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically 
significant respiratory or circulatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> secondary to morphine 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. Such agents should be administered cautiously to persons who are 
known, or suspected to be physically dependent on EMBEDA. In such cases, an 
abrupt or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute 
withdrawal syndrome.</p>
<p>The sequestered naltrexone in EMBEDA has no role in the treatment of opioid 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>.</p>
<p>In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of an opioid 
receptor antagonist may precipitate an acute withdrawal. The severity of the 
withdrawal produced will depend on the degree of physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> and the 
dose of the antagonist administered. Use of an opioid antagonist should be 
reserved for cases where such treatment is clearly needed. If it is necessary to 
treat serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> in the physically dependent patient, 
administration of the antagonist should be begun with care and by titration with 
smaller than usual doses of the antagonist</p>

<a name="section-8"></a><p></p>
<a href="http://"></a>2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION<p class="First">Selection of patients for treatment with morphine sulfate should 
be governed by the same principles that apply to the use of similar opioid 
analgesics. Physicians should individualize treatment in every case, using 
non-opioid analgesics, opioids on an as needed basis and/or combination 
products, and chronic opioid therapy in a progressive plan of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> management 
such as outlined by the World Health Organization and Federation of State 
Medical Boards Model Guidelines.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Care should be taken to use low initial doses of EMBEDA in 
patients who are not already opioid-tolerant, especially those who are receiving 
concurrent treatment with muscle relaxants, sedatives, or other CNS active 
medications.</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">The 100 mg/4 mg capsules are for use only in opioid-tolerant 
patients.</span></p>
<p>EMBEDA is to be swallowed whole or the contents of the capsules sprinkled on 
apple sauce and taken by mouth. The pellets in the capsules are not to be 
crushed, dissolved, or chewed before swallowing.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>2.1 Initiating Therapy with EMBEDA<p>It is critical to adjust the dosing regimen for each patient 
individually, taking into account the patient's prior analgesic treatment 
experience. In the selection of the initial dose of EMBEDA, attention should be 
given to:</p>
<p>1) the total daily dose, potency, and kind of opioid the patient has been 
taking previously;<br>2) the reliability of the relative potency estimate used 
to calculate the equivalent dose of morphine needed (Note: potency estimates may 
vary with the route of administration);<br>3) the patient's degree of opioid 
experience and opioid tolerance;<br>4) the general condition and medical status 
of the patient;<br>5) concurrent medication;<br>6) the type and severity of the 
patient's <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>.</p>
<p>The following dosing recommendations can be considered approaches to what is 
actually a series of clinical decisions over time in the management of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> 
of an individual patient:</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Underline">Use of EMBEDA as the First Opioid 
Analgesic</span></span></p>
<p>The lowest dose of EMBEDA should be used as the initial opioid analgesic in 
patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436096" conceptname="Chronic pain">chronic pain</span>. Patients may subsequently be titrated to a once or 
twice a day dosage which adequately manages their <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Underline">Conversion from Other Oral Morphine 
Formulations to EMBEDA </span></span></p>
<p>Patients on other oral morphine formulations may be converted to EMBEDA by 
administering one-half of the patient's total daily oral morphine dose as EMBEDA 
every 12 hours (twice-a-day) or by administering the total daily oral morphine 
dose as EMBEDA every 24 hours (once-a-day). EMBEDA should not be given more 
frequently than every 12 hours.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Underline">Conversion from Oral Opioids, 
Parenteral Morphine, or Other Parenteral Opioids to EMBEDA </span></span></p>
<p>EMBEDA can be administered to patients previously receiving treatment with 
parenteral morphine or other opioids. While there are useful tables of oral and 
parenteral equivalents in cancer <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, there is substantial inter-patient 
variation in the relative potency of different opioid drugs and formulations. 
For these reasons, it is better to underestimate the patient's 24-hour oral 
morphine requirement and provide rescue medication than to overestimate and 
manage an adverse event. The following general points should be considered:</p>
<ol>
<li>Parenteral to Oral Morphine Ratio: It may take anywhere from 2-6 mg of oral 
morphine to provide <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> equivalent to 1 mg of parenteral morphine. A dose 
of oral morphine three times the daily parenteral morphine requirement may be 
sufficient in chronic use settings. 
</li>
<li>Other Oral or Parenteral Opioids to Oral Morphine Sulfate: There is lack of 
systematic evidence bearing on these types of analgesic substitutions. 
Therefore, specific recommendations are not possible. Physicians are advised to 
refer to published relative potency data, keeping in mind that such ratios are 
only approximate. In general, it is safest to give half of the estimated daily 
morphine demand as the initial dose and to manage <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012238" conceptname="Inadequate analgesia">inadequate analgesia</span> by 
supplementation with immediate-release morphine. </li>
</ol>
<p>The first dose of EMBEDA may be taken with the last dose of any 
immediate-release (short-acting) opioid medication due to the extended-release 
characteristics of EMBEDA.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>2.2 Individualization of Dosage<p>Patients may develop some degree of tolerance, requiring dosage 
adjustment until they have achieved their individual balance between effective 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span> and opioid side effects such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, sedation, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">constipation</span>. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>EMBEDA should be titrated no more frequently than every-other-day to allow 
patients to stabilize before escalating the dose. 
</li>
<li>If breakthrough <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> occurs, the dose may be supplemented with a small dose 
(less than 20% of the total daily dose) of a short-acting analgesic. 
</li>
<li>Patients who exhibit signs of excessive opioid side effects such as sedation

</li>
<li>Patients who experience <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012238" conceptname="Inadequate analgesia">inadequate analgesia</span> on once-daily dosing should be 
switched to twice-a-day. 
</li>
<li>EMBEDA should not be dosed more frequently than every 12 hours. </li>
</ul>
<p>During periods of changing analgesic requirements including initial 
titration, frequent communication is recommended between physician, other 
members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>2.3 Alternative Methods of Administration<p>Patients who have difficulty swallowing whole capsules or tablets 
may benefit from an alternative method of administration. EMBEDA pellets may be 
sprinkled over apple sauce. Other foods have not been tested and should not be 
substituted for apple sauce. </p>
<ol>
<li>Sprinkle the pellets onto a small amount of apple sauce and use immediately. 

</li>
<li>The patient must be cautioned not to chew the pellets <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#i4i_warnings_precautions_id_a0a10269-1cca-487b-a14d-1f28e14079bc">WARNINGS 
AND PRECAUTIONS (5)</a>]</span>. 
</li>
<li>Rinse mouth to ensure all pellets have been swallowed. 
</li>
<li>Patients should consume entire portion and should not divide apple sauce 
into separate doses.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Do not administer EMBEDA pellets through a nasogastric or gastric 
tubes.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>2.4 Maintenance of Therapy<p>Continual re-evaluation of the patient receiving morphine sulfate 
is important, with special attention to the maintenance of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> control and the 
relative incidence of side effects associated with therapy. If the level of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> 
increases, effort should be made to identify the source of increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, while 
adjusting the dose as described above to decrease the level of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>. During 
chronic therapy, especially for non-cancer-related <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> (or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> associated with 
other terminal illnesses), the continued need for the use of opioid analgesics 
should be re-assessed as appropriate.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>2.5 Cessation of Therapy<p>In general, EMBEDA should not be abruptly discontinued. However, 
EMBEDA, like other opioids, can be safely discontinued without the development 
of withdrawal symptoms by slowly tapering the daily dose.</p>
