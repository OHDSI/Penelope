<h2>8.1 Pregnancy</h2>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34077-8">
<a name="section-7.1.1"></a><p></p>
<p class="First">Pregnancy Category B.</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with Spinosad Topical Suspension in pregnant women. Studies in humans did not assess for the absorption of benzyl alcohol contained in Spinosad Topical Suspension. Reproduction studies conducted in rats and rabbits were negative for teratogenic effects. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p>
<p>No comparisons of animal exposure with human exposure are provided in this labeling due to the low systemic exposure noted in the clinical pharmacokinetic study <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#s12.3">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</a>]</span> which did not allow for the determination of human AUC values that could be used for this calculation.</p>
<p>Systemic embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits. Oral doses of 10, 50 and 200 mg/kg/day spinosad were administered during the period of organogenesis (gestational days 6 – 15) to pregnant female rats. No teratogenic effects were noted at any dose. Maternal toxicity occurred at 200 mg/kg/day. Oral doses of 2.5, 10, and 50 mg/kg/day spinosad were administered during the period of organogenesis (gestational days 7 – 19) to pregnant female rabbits. No teratogenic effects were noted at any dose. Maternal toxicity occurred at 50 mg/kg/day.</p>
<p>A two-generation dietary reproduction study was conducted in rats. Oral doses of 3, 10, and 100 mg/kg/day spinosad were administered to male and female rats from 10-12 weeks prior to mating and throughout mating, parturition, and lactation. No reproductive/developmental toxicity was noted at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day. In the presence of maternal toxicity, increased dystocia in parturition, decreased gestation survival, decreased litter size, decreased pup body weight, and decreased neonatal survival occurred at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day.</p>

<h2>8.3 Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Spinosad, the active ingredient in Spinosad Topical Suspension is not systemically absorbed; and therefore, will not be present in human milk. However, Spinosad Topical Suspension contains benzyl alcohol, which may be systemically absorbed through the skin, and the amount of benzyl alcohol excreted in human milk with use of Spinosad Topical Suspension is unknown. Caution should be exercised when Spinosad Topical Suspension is administered to a lactating woman. A lactating woman may choose to pump and discard breast milk for 8 hours (5 half-lives of benzyl alcohol) after use to avoid infant ingestion of benzyl alcohol.</p>

<p>Safety in pediatric patients below the age of 4 years has not been established. Spinosad Topical Suspension is not recommended in pediatric patients below the age of 6 months because of the potential for increased systemic absorption due to a high ratio of skin surface area to body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> and the potential for an immature skin barrier.</p>

<h2>12.3 Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">An open-label, single-center study was conducted over a period of seven days to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of spinosad 1.8% in pediatric subjects with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="132835" conceptname="Pediculosis capitis">head lice</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432251" conceptname="Disease caused by parasite">infestation</span>. Fourteen (14) subjects, 4 – 15 years of age, with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="132835" conceptname="Pediculosis capitis">head lice</span> were enrolled into the study. All subjects applied a single topical (scalp) treatment of spinosad 1.8% for 10 minutes, after which the test article was washed off, and subjects underwent plasma sampling. Plasma samples were analyzed by a validated LC/MS/MS method. Results demonstrated that spinosad was below the limit of quantitation (3ng/mL) in all samples. The bioavailability of benzyl alcohol from Spinosad Topical Suspension is unknown as plasma concentrations of benzyl alcohol were not determined in these subjects.</p>

<h2>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of fertility</h2>
<p class="First">In an oral (diet) mouse carcinogenicity study, spinosad was administered to CD-1 mice at doses of 0.0025, 0.008, and 0.036% in the diet (approximately 3.4, 11.4, and 50.9 mg/kg/day for males and 4.2, 13.8, and 67.0 mg/kg/day for females) for 18 months. No treatment-related tumors were noted in the mouse carcinogenicity study up to the highest doses evaluated in this study of 50.9 mg/kg/day in male mice and 13.8 mg/kg/day in female mice. Female mice treated with a dose of 67.0 mg/kg/day were not evaluated in this study due to high mortality.</p>
<p>In an oral (diet) rat carcinogenicity study, spinosad was administered to Fischer 344 rats at doses of 0.005, 0.02, 0.05, and 0.1% in the diet (approximately 2.4, 9.5, 24.1 and 49.4 mg/kg/day for males and 3.0, 12.0, 30.1 and 62.8 mg/kg/day for females) for 24 months. No treatment-related tumors were noted in the rat carcinogenicity study in male or female rats up to the highest doses evaluated in this study of 24.1 mg/kg/day in male rats and 30.1 mg/kg/day in female rats. Rats in the highest dose group in this study were not evaluated due to high mortality.</p>
<p>Spinosad demonstrated no evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic potential based on the results of four <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> genotoxicity tests (Ames assay, mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> L5178Y assay, Chinese hamster ovary cell chromosome aberration assay, and rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis assay) and one <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> genotoxicity test (mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay).</p>
<p>Oral administration of spinosad (in diet) to rats, throughout mating, gestation, parturition and lactation, demonstrated no effects on growth, fertility or reproduction, at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#s8.1">Pregnancy (8.1)</a>].</span></p>

<h1>14 CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First">Two multicenter, randomized, investigator-blind, active-controlled studies were conducted in 1038 subjects 6 months of age and older with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="132835" conceptname="Pediculosis capitis">head lice</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432251" conceptname="Disease caused by parasite">infestation</span>. A total of 552 subjects were treated with Spinosad Topical Suspension. For the evaluation of efficacy, the youngest subject from each household was considered to be the primary subject of the household, and other members in the household were enrolled in the study as secondary subjects, and evaluated for all safety parameters.</p>
<p>In Study 1, 91 primary subjects were randomized to Spinosad Topical Suspension, and 89 primary subjects were randomized to permethrin 1%. In Study 2, 83 and 84 primary subjects were randomized to Spinosad Topical Suspension and permethrin 1%, respectively.</p>
<p>In both studies, all subjects who were treated on Day 0 returned for efficacy evaluation at Day 7. Subjects with live lice present at Day 7 received a second treatment. Subjects who were lice free on Day 7 were to return on Day 14 for evaluation. Subjects with live lice and who received a second treatment were to return on Days 14 and 21.</p>
<p>Efficacy was assessed as the proportion of primary subjects who were free of live lice 14 days after the final treatment. Table 2 contains the proportion of primary subjects who were free of live lice in each of the two trials.</p>

<p>Read the Patient Information that comes with Spinosad Topical Suspension before you start using it and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What is Spinosad Topical Suspension?</span></p>
<p>Spinosad Topical Suspension is a prescription medicine used to get rid of lice in scalp hair of children and adults.</p>
<p>It is not known if Spinosad Topical Suspension is safe for children under 4 years of age or in people over age 65.</p>
<p>Once Spinosad Topical Suspension is washed off, a fine-tooth comb may be used to remove treated lice and nits from the hair and scalp, but combing is not required. All personal items exposed to the hair or lice should be washed in hot water or dry-cleaned. See "<a href="#stoplice">How do I stop the spread of lice?</a>" at the end of this leaflet.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What should I tell my healthcare provider before I use Spinosad Topical Suspension?</span></p>

<p><span class="Italics">To help prevent the spread of lice from one person to another, here are some steps you can take:</span></p>
<ul class="Disc">
<li>Avoid direct head-to-head contact with anyone known to have live, crawling lice.</li>
<li>Do not share combs, brushes, hats, scarves, bandannas, ribbons, barrettes, hair bands, towels, helmets, or other hair-related personal items with anyone else, whether they have lice or not.</li>
<li>Avoid sleepovers and slumber parties during lice outbreaks. Lice can live in bedding, pillows, and carpets that have recently been used by someone with lice.</li>
<li>After finishing treatment with lice medicine, check everyone in your family for lice after one week. Be sure to talk to your healthcare provider about treatments for those who have lice.</li>
<li>Machine-wash any bedding and clothing used by anyone having lice. Machine wash at <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">high temperatures</span> (150°F) and tumble in a hot dryer for 20 minutes.</li>
