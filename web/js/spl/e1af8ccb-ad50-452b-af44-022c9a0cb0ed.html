<h1>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<ul>
<li>Individualize the starting dose of JANUMET based on the patient's current regimen. (<a href="#i4i_section_id_b36875ff-eb46-4f9e-9e7b-990303d2728d">2.1</a>)</li>
<li>May adjust the dosing based on effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 100 mg sitagliptin and 2000 mg metformin. (<a href="#i4i_section_id_b36875ff-eb46-4f9e-9e7b-990303d2728d">2.1</a>)</li>
<li>JANUMET should be given twice daily with meals, with gradual dose escalation, to reduce the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects due to metformin. (<a href="#i4i_section_id_b36875ff-eb46-4f9e-9e7b-990303d2728d">2.1</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The dosage of JANUMET should be individualized on the basis of the patient's current regimen, effectiveness, and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 100 mg sitagliptin and 2000 mg metformin. Initial combination therapy or maintenance of combination therapy should be individualized and left to the discretion of the health care provider.</p>
<p><span>JANUMET should generally be given twice daily with meals, with gradual dose escalation, to reduce the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects due to metformin. JANUMET must not be split or divided before swallowing.</span></p>
<p>The starting dose of JANUMET should be based on the patient's current regimen. JANUMET should be given twice daily with meals. The following doses are available: </p>
<p>50 mg sitagliptin/500 mg metformin hydrochloride</p>
<p>50 mg sitagliptin/1000 mg metformin hydrochloride.</p>
<p>The recommended starting dose in patients not currently treated with metformin is 50 mg sitagliptin/500 mg metformin hydrochloride twice daily, with gradual dose escalation recommended to reduce gastrointestinal side effects associated with metformin. </p>
<p>The starting dose in patients already treated with metformin should provide sitagliptin dosed as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) and the dose of metformin already being taken. For patients taking metformin 850 mg twice daily, the recommended starting dose of JANUMET is 50 mg sitagliptin/1000 mg metformin hydrochloride twice daily.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Patients treated with an insulin secretagogue or insulin </span></p>
<p>Co-administration of JANUMET with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may require lower doses of the insulin secretagogue or insulin to reduce the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#i4i_section_id_f84e3f64-274e-4beb-b6c8-fbf20f881a35">Warnings and Precautions (5.9)</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>No studies have been performed specifically examining the safety and efficacy of JANUMET in patients previously treated with other oral antihyperglycemic agents and switched to JANUMET. Any change in therapy of type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> should be undertaken with care and appropriate monitoring as changes in glycemic control can occur.</p>

When metformin is implicated as the cause of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span>, metformin plasma levels &gt;5 μg/mL are generally found.</p>
<p>The reported incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span> in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span>. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>, including both intrinsic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span> and renal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4131044" conceptname="Hypoperfusion">hypoperfusion</span>, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications.

The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span> increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span> may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span>.

Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism.

<p></p>
<p>Since impaired hepatic function has been associated with some cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span>, JANUMET should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic disease</span>.</p>
<p>

<p>Metformin and sitagliptin are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney. The risk of metformin accumulation and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span> increases with the degree of impairment of renal function. Thus, patients with serum creatinine levels above the upper limit of normal for their age should not receive JANUMET. In the elderly, JANUMET should be carefully titrated to establish the minimum dose for adequate glycemic effect, because aging can be associated with reduced renal function. <span class="Italics">[See <a href="#i4i_section_id_fa45f89e-d2df-4659-a5f0-04e1d48e3bfa">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</a>; <a href="#i4i_geriatric_use_id_055aa6c9-3610-457b-86aa-196be7a3306c">Use in Specific Populations (8.5)</a>.]</span></p>
<p>									There have been postmarketing reports of worsening renal function, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span>, sometimes requiring dialysis. Before initiation of therapy with JANUMET and at least annually thereafter, renal function should be assessed and verified as normal.

<p>In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum Vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B<span class="Sub">12</span> absorption from the B<span class="Sub">12</span>-intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span> and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or Vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> supplementation. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on JANUMET and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed. <span class="Italics">[See <a href="#i4i_section_id_fdbb379a-cc46-4482-9b0e-673de49b8a9c">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</a>.]</span></p>
<p>Certain individuals (those with inadequate Vitamin B<span class="Sub">12 </span>or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal Vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> levels. In these patients, routine serum Vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> measurements at two- to three-year intervals may be useful.</p>
<p>

<p></p>
<p>Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients, therefore, should be warned against excessive alcohol intake, acute or chronic, while receiving JANUMET.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Use of JANUMET should be temporarily suspended for any surgical procedure (except minor procedures not associated with restricted intake of food and fluids) and should not be restarted until the patient's oral intake has resumed and renal function has been evaluated as normal.</p>

<p>A patient with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> previously well controlled on JANUMET who develops laboratory abnormalities or clinical illness (especially vague and poorly defined illness) should be evaluated promptly for evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4209145" conceptname="Ketoacidosis">ketoacidosis</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span>. Evaluation should include serum electrolytes and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4017413" conceptname="Acetoacetate">ketones</span>, blood glucose and, if indicated, blood pH, lactate, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029769" conceptname="Pyruvic acid">pyruvate</span>, and metformin levels. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435517" conceptname="Acidosis">acidosis</span> of either form occurs, JANUMET must be stopped immediately and other appropriate corrective measures initiated.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Sitagliptin</span></p>
<p>When sitagliptin was used in combination with a sulfonylurea or with insulin, medications known to cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>, the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> was increased over that of placebo used in combination with a sulfonylurea or with insulin <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#i4i_adverse_effects_id_c473ffd3-c412-4b7c-a096-1ee750621869">Adverse Reactions (6)</a>].</span> Therefore, patients also receiving an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may require a lower dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin to reduce the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#i4i_section_id_b36875ff-eb46-4f9e-9e7b-990303d2728d">Dosage and Administration (2.1)</a>]</span>.</p>

<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Concomitant medication(s) that may affect renal function or result in significant hemodynamic change or may interfere with the disposition of metformin, such as cationic drugs that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#i4i_section_id_493abd5d-d077-4b78-a0d2-52826d48ea63">Drug Interactions (7.1)</a>]</span>, should be used with caution.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Intravascular contrast studies with iodinated materials (for example, intravenous urogram, intravenous cholangiography, angiography, and computed tomography (CT) scans with intravascular contrast materials) can lead to acute alteration of renal function and have been associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239233" conceptname="Lactic acidosis">lactic acidosis</span> in patients receiving metformin <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#i4i_contraindications_id_1e14ca17-0b41-4d3f-a582-2bb77c26aa32">Contraindications (4)</a>]</span>. Therefore, in patients in whom any such study is planned, JANUMET should be temporarily discontinued at the time of or prior to the procedure, and withheld for 48 hours subsequent to the procedure and reinstituted only after renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be normal.</p>

<p>The incidence of laboratory adverse reactions was similar in patients treated with sitagliptin and metformin (7.6%) compared to patients treated with placebo and metformin (8.7%). In most but not all studies, a small increase in white blood cell count (approximately 200 cells/microL difference in WBC vs placebo; mean baseline WBC approximately 6600 cells/microL) was observed due to a small increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4148615" conceptname="Neutrophil count">neutrophils</span>.

<p>In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum Vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B<span class="Sub">12</span> absorption from the B<span class="Sub">12</span>-intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439777" conceptname="Anemia">anemia</span> and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or Vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> supplementation. <span class="Italics">[See <a href="#i4i_section_id_cf21bd48-13b4-4b56-a5b7-39230c26d665">Warnings and Precautions (5.5)</a>.]</span></p>

<p>Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of JANUMET or sitagliptin, one of the components of JANUMET. These reactions have been reported when JANUMET or sitagliptin have been used alone and/or in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents.

<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cationic drugs (e.g., amiloride, digoxin, morphine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine, ranitidine, triamterene, trimethoprim, or vancomycin) that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion theoretically have the potential for interaction with metformin by competing for common renal tubular transport systems. Such interaction between metformin and oral cimetidine has been observed in normal healthy volunteers in both single- and multiple-dose metformin-cimetidine drug interaction studies, with a 60% increase in peak metformin plasma and whole blood concentrations and a 40% increase in plasma and whole blood metformin AUC. There was no change in elimination half-life in the single-dose study. Metformin had no effect on cimetidine pharmacokinetics. Although such interactions remain theoretical (except for cimetidine), careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of JANUMET and/or the interfering drug is recommended in patients who are taking cationic medications that are excreted via the proximal renal tubular secretory system.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>There was a slight increase in the area under the curve (AUC, 11%) and mean peak drug concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>, 18%) of digoxin with the co-administration of 100 mg sitagliptin for 10 days. These increases are not considered likely to be clinically meaningful. Digoxin, as a cationic drug, has the potential to compete with metformin for common renal tubular transport systems, thus affecting the serum concentrations of either digoxin, metformin or both. Patients receiving digoxin should be monitored appropriately. No dosage adjustment of digoxin or JANUMET is recommended.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a single-dose interaction study in type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> patients, co-administration of metformin and glyburide did not result in any changes in either metformin pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. Decreases in glyburide AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> were observed, but were highly variable. The single-dose nature of this study and the lack of correlation between glyburide blood levels and pharmacodynamic effects make the clinical significance of this interaction uncertain.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>A single-dose, metformin-furosemide drug interaction study in healthy subjects demonstrated that pharmacokinetic parameters of both compounds were affected by co-administration. Furosemide increased the metformin plasma and blood C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 22% and blood AUC by 15%, without any significant change in metformin renal clearance. When administered with metformin, the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of furosemide were 31% and 12% smaller, respectively, than when administered alone, and the terminal half-life was decreased by 32%, without any significant change in furosemide renal clearance. No information is available about the interaction of metformin and furosemide when co-administered chronically.</p>

</p>
<p></p>
<p>A single-dose, metformin-nifedipine drug interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that co-administration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount excreted in the urine. T<span class="Sub">max</span> and half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Metformin had minimal effects on nifedipine.</p>

<p>Certain drugs tend to produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span> and may lead to loss of glycemic control. These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving JANUMET the patient should be closely observed to maintain adequate glycemic control.</p>
<p>In healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of metformin and propranolol, and metformin and ibuprofen were not affected when co-administered in single-dose interaction studies.</p>
<p>Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins and is, therefore, less likely to interact with highly protein-bound drugs such as salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, and probenecid, as compared to the sulfonylureas, which are extensively bound to serum proteins.</p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Pregnancy Category B:</span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">JANUMET</span></p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women with JANUMET or its individual components; therefore, the safety of JANUMET in pregnant women is not known. JANUMET should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p>
<p>Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co., Inc., maintains a registry to monitor the pregnancy outcomes of women exposed to JANUMET while pregnant. Health care providers are encouraged to report any prenatal exposure to JANUMET by calling the Pregnancy Registry at 1-800-986-8999.</p>
<p>No animal studies have been conducted with the combined products in JANUMET to evaluate effects on reproduction. The following data are based on findings in studies performed with sitagliptin or metformin individually.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Sitagliptin</span></p>
<p>Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits. Doses of sitagliptin up to 125 mg/kg (approximately 12 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose) did not impair fertility or harm the fetus. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies with sitagliptin in pregnant women.</p>
<p>Sitagliptin administered to pregnant female rats and rabbits from gestation day 6 to 20 (organogenesis) was not teratogenic at oral doses up to 250 mg/kg (rats) and 125 mg/kg (rabbits), or approximately 30 and 20 times human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons. Higher doses increased the incidence of rib malformations in offspring at 1000 mg/kg, or approximately 100 times human exposure at the MRHD.</p>
<p>Sitagliptin administered to female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 21 decreased body weight in male and female offspring at 1000 mg/kg. No functional or behavioral toxicity was observed in offspring of rats.</p>
<p>Placental transfer of sitagliptin administered to pregnant rats was approximately 45% at 2 hours and 80% at 24 hours postdose. Placental transfer of sitagliptin administered to pregnant rabbits was approximately 66% at 2 hours and 30% at 24 hours.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Metformin hydrochloride</span></p>
<p>Metformin was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day. This represents an exposure of about 2 and 6 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2,000 mg based on body surface area comparisons for rats and rabbits, respectively. Determination of fetal concentrations demonstrated a partial placental barrier to metformin.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>No studies in lactating animals have been conducted with the combined components of JANUMET. In studies performed with the individual components, both sitagliptin and metformin are secreted in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether sitagliptin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when JANUMET is administered to a nursing woman.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Safety and effectiveness of JANUMET in pediatric patients under 18 years have not been established.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Italics">JANUMET</span></p>
<p>Because sitagliptin and metformin are substantially excreted by the kidney, and because aging can be associated with reduced renal function, JANUMET should be used with caution as age increases. Care should be taken in dose selection and should be based on careful and regular monitoring of renal function. <span class="Italics">[See <a href="#i4i_section_id_fa45f89e-d2df-4659-a5f0-04e1d48e3bfa">Warnings and Precautions (5.1</a>, <a href="#i4i_section_id_0b15d4d5-a071-4161-ba24-f6aa46a6e80b">5.4)</a>; <a href="#i4i_pharmacokinetics_id_bc5c08b5-4de1-4d73-b5e4-083706d31132">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</a>.]</span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Sitagliptin</span></p>
<p>Of the total number of subjects (N=3884) in Phase II and III clinical studies of sitagliptin, 725 patients were 65 years and over, while 61 patients were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years and over and younger subjects. While this and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Metformin hydrochloride</span></p>
<p>Controlled clinical studies of metformin did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients, although other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and young patients. Metformin should only be used in patients with normal renal function. The initial and maintenance dosing of metformin should be conservative in patients with advanced age, due to the potential for decreased renal function in this population. Any dose adjustment should be based on a careful assessment of renal function. <span class="Italics">[See <a href="#i4i_contraindications_id_1e14ca17-0b41-4d3f-a582-2bb77c26aa32">Contraindications (4)</a>; <a href="#i4i_section_id_0b15d4d5-a071-4161-ba24-f6aa46a6e80b">Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</a>; <a href="#i4i_pharmacokinetics_id_bc5c08b5-4de1-4d73-b5e4-083706d31132">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</a>.]</span></p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Sitagliptin</span></p>
<p>During controlled clinical trials in healthy subjects, single doses of up to 800 mg sitagliptin were administered. Maximal mean increases in QTc of 8.0 msec were observed in one study at a dose of 800 mg sitagliptin, a mean effect that is not considered clinically important <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#i4i_pharmacodynamics_id_7027c390-efc5-4ea2-b9f8-cd6ae4e43327">Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)</a>]</span>. There is no experience with doses above 800 mg in clinical studies. In Phase I multiple-dose studies, there were no dose-related clinical adverse reactions observed with sitagliptin with doses of up to 400 mg per day for periods of up to 28 days.</p>
<p>In the event of an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures, e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining an electrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy as indicated by the patient's clinical status.</p>
<p>Sitagliptin is modestly dialyzable. In clinical studies, approximately 13.5% of the dose was removed over a 3- to 4-hour hemodialysis session. Prolonged hemodialysis may be considered if clinically appropriate. It is not known if sitagliptin is dialyzable by peritoneal dialysis.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p><span class="Italics">JANUMET</span></p>
<p>JANUMET combines two antihyperglycemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>: sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and metformin hydrochloride, a member of the biguanide class. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Sitagliptin</span></p>
<p>Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Metformin hydrochloride</span></p>
<p>Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Its pharmacologic mechanisms of action are different from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin does not produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span> in either patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> or normal subjects (except in special circumstances <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#i4i_section_id_f84e3f64-274e-4beb-b6c8-fbf20f881a35">Warnings and Precautions (5.9)</a>]</span>) and does not cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4307509" conceptname="Hyperinsulinism">hyperinsulinemia</span>. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may actually decrease.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Sitagliptin</span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">General</span></p>
<p>In patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Sitagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride Co-administration</span></p>
<p>In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Co-administration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear what these findings mean for changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>.</p>
<p>In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></p>
<p>In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800-mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline at 3 hours postdose was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800-mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose.</p>
<p>In patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="Italics">JANUMET</span></p>
<p>The results of a bioequivalence study in healthy subjects demonstrated that the JANUMET (sitagliptin/metformin HCl) 50 mg/500 mg and 50 mg/1000 mg combination tablets are bioequivalent to co-administration of corresponding doses of sitagliptin (JANUVIA<span class="Sup">®</span>) and metformin hydrochloride as individual tablets.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Sitagliptin</span></p>
<p>The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Co-administration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Metformin hydrochloride</span></p>
<p>The absolute bioavailability of a metformin hydrochloride 500-mg tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50-60%. Studies using single oral doses of metformin hydrochloride tablets 500 mg to 1500 mg, and 850 mg to 2550 mg, indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination. Food decreases the extent of and slightly delays the absorption of metformin, as shown by approximately a 40% lower mean peak plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>), a 25% lower area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), and a 35-minute prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) following administration of a single 850-mg tablet of metformin with food, compared to the same tablet strength administered fasting. The clinical relevance of these decreases is unknown.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Sitagliptin</span></p>
<p>The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%).</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Metformin hydrochloride</span></p>
<p>The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of metformin hydrochloride tablets 850 mg averaged 654 ± 358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins, in contrast to sulfonylureas, which are more than 90% protein bound. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin hydrochloride tablets, steady-state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24-48 hours and are generally &lt;1 mcg/mL. During controlled clinical trials of metformin, maximum metformin plasma levels did not exceed 5 mcg/mL, even at maximum doses.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Sitagliptin</span></p>
<p>Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination.</p>
<p>Following a [<span class="Sup">14</span>C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Metformin hydrochloride</span></p>
<p>Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Sitagliptin</span></p>
<p>Following administration of an oral [<span class="Sup">14</span>C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in feces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing. The apparent terminal t<span class="Sub">1/2 </span>following a 100-mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min.</p>
<p>Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of p-glycoprotein, which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a p-glycoprotein inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Metformin hydrochloride</span></p>
<p>Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> may be a compartment of distribution.</p>

<p>Metformin pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between normal subjects and patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> when analyzed according to gender. Similarly, in controlled clinical studies in patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>, the antihyperglycemic effect of metformin was comparable in males and females.</p>

<p><span class="Italics">Sitagliptin</span></p>
<p>When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Metformin hydrochloride</span></p>
<p>Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half life is prolonged, and C<span class="Sub">max </span>is increased, compared to healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function (see <span class="Bold">GLUCOPHAGE 									</span> prescribing information:<span class="Bold"> CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>, Special Populations, Geriatrics).</p>

<p>Co-administration of multiple doses of sitagliptin (50 mg) and metformin (1000 mg) given twice daily did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of either sitagliptin or metformin in patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>.</p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with JANUMET have not been performed; however, such studies have been conducted with the individual components of JANUMET (sitagliptin and metformin hydrochloride).</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Sitagliptin</span></p>
<p><span class="Underline"><span class="Italics">In Vitro</span> Assessment of Drug Interactions</span></p>
<p>Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4. Sitagliptin is a p-glycoprotein substrate, but does not inhibit p-glycoprotein mediated transport of digoxin. Based on these results, sitagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other drugs that utilize these pathways.</p>
<p>Sitagliptin is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. Therefore, the propensity of sitagliptin to be involved in clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions mediated by plasma protein binding displacement is very low.</p>
<p><span class="Underline"><span class="Italics">In Vivo</span> Assessment of Drug Interactions</span></p>
<p><span class="Italics">Effect of Sitagliptin on Other Drugs</span></p>
<p>In clinical studies, as described below, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, warfarin, or oral contraceptives, providing <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Digoxin:</span> Sitagliptin had a minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. Following administration of 0.25 mg digoxin concomitantly with 100 mg of sitagliptin daily for 10 days, the plasma AUC of digoxin was increased by 11%, and the plasma C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 18%.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Sulfonylureas:</span> Single-dose pharmacokinetics of glyburide, a CYP2C9 substrate, was not meaningfully altered in subjects receiving multiple doses of sitagliptin. Clinically meaningful interactions would not be expected with other sulfonylureas (e.g., glipizide, tolbutamide, and glimepiride) which, like glyburide, are primarily eliminated by CYP2C9 <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#i4i_section_id_f84e3f64-274e-4beb-b6c8-fbf20f881a35">Warnings and Precautions (5.9)</a>]</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Simvastatin:</span> Single-dose pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, a CYP3A4 substrate, was not meaningfully altered in subjects receiving multiple daily doses of sitagliptin. Therefore, sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Thiazolidinediones:</span> Single-dose pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone was not meaningfully altered in subjects receiving multiple daily doses of sitagliptin, indicating that sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP2C8-mediated metabolism.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Warfarin:</span> Multiple daily doses of sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics, as assessed by measurement of S(-) or R(+) warfarin enantiomers, or pharmacodynamics (as assessed by measurement of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> INR) of a single dose of warfarin. Because S(-) warfarin is primarily metabolized by CYP2C9, these data also support the conclusion that sitagliptin is not a CYP2C9 inhibitor.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Oral Contraceptives:</span> Co-administration with sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of norethindrone or ethinyl estradiol. </p>
<p><span class="Italics">Effect of Other Drugs on Sitagliptin</span></p>
<p>Clinical data described below suggest that sitagliptin is not susceptible to clinically meaningful interactions by co-administered medications.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Cyclosporine:</span> A study was conducted to assess the effect of cyclosporine, a potent inhibitor of p-glycoprotein, on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Co-administration of a single 100-mg oral dose of sitagliptin and a single 600-mg oral dose of cyclosporine increased the AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of sitagliptin by approximately 29% and 68%, respectively. These modest changes in sitagliptin pharmacokinetics were not considered to be clinically meaningful. The renal clearance of sitagliptin was also not meaningfully altered. Therefore, meaningful interactions would not be expected with other p-glycoprotein inhibitors.</p>

<h1>NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p><span class="Italics">JANUMET</span></p>
<p>No animal studies have been conducted with the combined products in JANUMET to evaluate carcinogenesis, mutagenesis or impairment of fertility. The following data are based on the findings in studies with sitagliptin and metformin individually.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Sitagliptin</span></p>
<p>A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female rats given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 150, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was an increased incidence of combined liver <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenoma</span>/carcinoma in males and females and of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201519" conceptname="Primary malignant neoplasm of liver">liver carcinoma</span> in females at 500 mg/kg. This dose results in exposures approximately 60 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily adult human dose (MRHD) of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322895" conceptname="Nodule of liver">Liver tumors</span> were not observed at 150 mg/kg, approximately 20 times the human exposure at the MRHD. A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female mice given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was no increase in the incidence of tumors in any organ up to 500 mg/kg, approximately 70 times human exposure at the MRHD. Sitagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) chromosome aberration assay, an <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>cytogenetics assay in CHO, an <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>rat hepatocyte DNA alkaline elution assay, and an <span class="Italics">in vivo </span>micronucleus assay.</p>
<p>In rat fertility studies with oral gavage doses of 125, 250, and 1000 mg/kg, males were treated for 4 weeks prior to mating, during mating, up to scheduled termination (approximately 8 weeks total), and females were treated 2 weeks prior to mating through gestation day 7. No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 125 mg/kg (approximately 12 times human exposure at the MRHD of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons). At higher doses, nondose-related increased resorptions in females were observed (approximately 25 and 100 times human exposure at the MRHD based on AUC comparison).</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Metformin hydrochloride</span></p>
<p>Long-term carcinogenicity studies have been performed in rats (dosing duration of 104 weeks) and mice (dosing duration of 91 weeks) at doses up to and including 900 mg/kg/day and 1500 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are both approximately four times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2000 mg based on body surface area comparisons. No evidence of carcinogenicity with metformin was found in either male or female mice. Similarly, there was no tumorigenic potential observed with metformin in male rats. There was, however, an increased incidence of benign stromal uterine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4187628" conceptname="Polyp">polyps</span> in female rats treated with 900 mg/kg/day.</p>
<p>There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of metformin in the following <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> tests: Ames test (<span class="Italics">S. typhimurium</span>), gene mutation test (mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> cells), or chromosomal aberrations test (human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span>). Results in the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus test were also negative. Fertility of male or female rats was unaffected by metformin when administered at doses as high as 600 mg/kg/day, which is approximately three times the maximum recommended human daily dose based on body surface area comparisons.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First"></p>
<p>The co-administration of sitagliptin and metformin has been studied in patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> inadequately controlled on diet and exercise and in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents.</p>
<p>There have been no clinical efficacy studies conducted with JANUMET; however, bioequivalence of JANUMET with co-administered sitagliptin and metformin hydrochloride tablets was demonstrated.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Sitagliptin and Metformin Co-administration in Patients with Type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">Diabetes</span> Inadequately Controlled on Diet and Exercise</span></p>
<p>A total of 1091 patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> and inadequate glycemic control on diet and exercise participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled factorial study designed to assess the efficacy of sitagliptin and metformin co-administration. Patients on an antihyperglycemic agent (N=541) underwent a diet, exercise, and drug washout period of up to 12 weeks duration. After the washout period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (N=550) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive placebo, 100 mg of sitagliptin once daily, 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin twice daily, or 50 mg of sitagliptin twice daily in combination with 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin twice daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with glyburide (glibenclamide) rescue.</p>
<p>Sitagliptin and metformin co-administration provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo, to metformin alone, and to sitagliptin alone (Table 4, Figure 1). Mean reductions from baseline in A1C were generally greater for patients with higher baseline A1C values. For patients not on an antihyperglycemic agent at study entry, mean reductions from baseline in A1C were: sitagliptin 100 mg once daily, -1.1%; metformin 500 mg bid, -1.1%; metformin 1000 mg bid, -1.2%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin 500 mg bid, -1.6%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin 1000 mg bid, -1.9%; and for patients receiving placebo, -0.2%. Lipid effects were generally neutral. The decrease in body weight in the groups given sitagliptin in combination with metformin was similar to that in the groups given metformin alone or placebo.</p>

Patients were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of sitagliptin or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue.</p>
<p>In combination with metformin, sitagliptin provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin (Table 5). Rescue glycemic therapy was used in 5% of patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg and 14% of patients treated with placebo. A similar decrease in body weight was observed for both treatment groups.</p>

<p>A total of 278 patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> participated in a 54-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of sitagliptin in combination with metformin and rosiglitazone. Patients on dual therapy with metformin ≥1500 mg/day and rosiglitazone ≥4 mg/day or with metformin ≥1500 mg/day and pioglitazone ≥30 mg/day (switched to rosiglitazone ≥4 mg/day) entered a dose-stable run-in period of 6 weeks. Patients on other dual therapy were switched to metformin ≥1500 mg/day and rosiglitazone ≥4 mg/day in a dose titration/stabilization run-in period of up to 20 weeks in duration. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized 2:1 to the addition of either 100 mg of sitagliptin or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) rescue. The primary time point for evaluation of glycemic parameters was Week 18.</p>
<p>In combination with metformin and rosiglitazone, sitagliptin provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 7) at Week 18. At Week 54, mean reduction in A1C was -1.0% for patients treated with sitagliptin and -0.3% for patients treated with placebo in an analysis based on the intent-to-treat population. Rescue therapy was used in 18% of patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg and 40% of patients treated with placebo. There was no significant difference between sitagliptin and placebo in body weight change.</p>

<p>A total of 641 patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of sitagliptin as add-on to insulin therapy. Approximately 75% of patients were also taking metformin. Patients entered a 2-week, single-blind run-in treatment period on pre-mixed, long-acting, or intermediate-acting insulin, with or without metformin (≥1500 mg per day). Patients using short-acting insulins were excluded unless the short-acting insulin was administered as part of a pre-mixed insulin. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of sitagliptin (N=229) or placebo (N=233), administered once daily. Patients were on a stable dose of insulin prior to enrollment with no changes in insulin dose permitted during the run-in period. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the double-blind treatment period were to have uptitration of the background insulin dose as rescue therapy.</p>
<p>Among patients also receiving metformin, the median daily insulin (pre-mixed, intermediate or long acting) dose at baseline was 40 units in the sitagliptin-treated patients and 42 units in the placebo-treated patients. The median change from baseline in daily dose of insulin was zero for both groups at the end of the study. Patients receiving sitagliptin with metformin and insulin had significant improvements in A1C, FPG and 2-hour PPG compared to patients receiving placebo with metformin and insulin (Table 8).

<p>The efficacy of sitagliptin was evaluated in a 52-week, double-blind, glipizide-controlled noninferiority trial in patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>. Patients not on treatment or on other antihyperglycemic agents entered a run-in treatment period of up to 12 weeks duration with metformin monotherapy (dose of ≥1500 mg per day) which included washout of medications other than metformin, if applicable. After the run-in period, those with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 6.5% to 10%) were randomized 1:1 to the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily or glipizide for 52 weeks. Patients receiving glipizide were given an initial dosage of 5 mg/day and then electively titrated over the next 18 weeks to a maximum dosage of 20 mg/day as needed to optimize glycemic control. Thereafter, the glipizide dose was to be kept constant, except for down-titration to prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. The mean dose of glipizide after the titration period was 10 mg.</p>
<p>After 52 weeks, sitagliptin and glipizide had similar mean reductions from baseline in A1C in the intent-to-treat analysis (Table 9). These results were consistent with the per protocol analysis (Figure 2). A conclusion in favor of the non-inferiority of sitagliptin to glipizide may be limited to patients with baseline A1C comparable to those included in the study (over 70% of patients had baseline A1C &lt;8% and over 90% had A1C &lt;9%).</p>

<p><span class="Bold">What is type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span>?</span></p>
<p>Type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin, and the insulin that your body produces does not work as well as it should. Your body can also make too much sugar. When this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. This can lead to serious medical problems.</p>
<p>High blood sugar can be lowered by diet and exercise, and by certain medicines when necessary.</p>
